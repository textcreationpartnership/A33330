            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here present thee with a Third Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of Modern Lives, concerning which some may object, and say, That many of them have been Printed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and in a more large and copious manner than we find them here? To which I answer, 'Tis true, and yet I judge it necessary thus to Print them again. For I have observed, that being generally Printed in little Volumes, few of them come to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Impression, but after a little time, are thrown aside and forgotten; whereas, when many excellent Lives are collected into one or more Volumes, they do continue, and will so do, till Printing shall be no more: Witness <hi>Plutarchs</hi> and <hi>Melchior Adams, &amp;c.</hi> Lives.</p>
               <p>And if any except against my contracting of some of them, I answer, That if you please to compare them together, you will find nothing left out that is of special concernment. I have always affected <hi>multum in paucis,</hi> to include much matter in few words, and yet withal, to avoid obscurity.</p>
               <p>I have been encouraged to make this Collection, and now to Publish it, finding that my former Labours in this kind, have been accepted with the Saints, and in the Church of Christ; which is apparent, for that they have been Printed four times in a few years space, and yet never less than a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62667:3"/> at a time. I am now in the Eighty third year of my Life, and therefore am never like to do more in this kind: but hope that God will raise up some more able person to carry on this so useful a work; and if my Judgment be of any value, these Lives are generally the best that ever I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished:</p>

               <p>WHen this Volume was almost finisht at the Press, it seemed good to the supream Governour of the World (in whose hands is our Life and Breath, and all things) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this painful, faithful Servant of Christ, from any further work in his Vineyard, and to give him <hi>Rest from his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> Hereupon the Book-seller desired, that his Life might be added to the rest. The motion seemed very reasonable, and sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, That he who had been a means of perpetuating the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of so many of Gods Worthies, should have his own Life recorded among the rest. The only difficulty was, concerning drawing of it up in such straits of time, as we were limited to by the circumstances of the Press: but this was soon removed by a Narrative I found in his Study, ready drawn up by himself: which, though it was done without any design to have it exposed to publick view; but, partly for the private information and edification of his Children, and partly as a thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Gods goodness to him, and to shew his good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over him, thro'out the whole course of his Life, (as himself expresses it before these Memoirs) yet, not meeting with any prohibition to the contrary, I have adventur'd to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to the publick, thereby to supply that defect, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Reader must have labour'd under. And I hope none will look upon it as a piece of Vanity in him, to commit such things to Writing concerning himself, since it's a bare relation of matters of Fact; which cannot be so fully done by any other, as by a man's self. (And therefore I wish that others, whom God has made eminently instrumental for the Service of his Church, would write after his Copy, and follow his Example herein:) His own account now follows.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I <hi>Samuel Clarke</hi> was Born in <hi>Woolston,</hi> in the County of <hi>Warwick,</hi> upon the 10th of <hi>October</hi> 1599. my Mother, who was a good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, died when I was young: my Father was a Godly, Able, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Painful Minister, and exercised his Ministry for above forty years in that Parish, with much profit and comfort: under whose wing I was trained up Religiously till I was about thirteen years old; and then I was set to School to Mr. <hi>Ja. Cranford,</hi> an eminent School-master in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry;</hi> which City at that time, flourished exceedingly with Religious Ministers and People, though for my own part, falling into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of dissolute Lads, I began to degenerate from the Principles of my first Education, though not without much reluctancy, and frequent checks of Conscience for the same.</p>
               <p>Having spent about four years in that School, I was by my Father carried to <hi>Cambridge;</hi> which University was more eminent for Religion at that time, and placed by him under Mr. <hi>Tho. Hooker</hi> in <hi>Emannel</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which was the <hi>Puritan</hi> Colledge; and Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> one of the choicest Tutors in the University: yet, neither there did I answer my Fathers care, nor the means which I did enjoy: for though my carriage was Civil, and in the sight of the world blameless, yet did I not walk with God in my general, nor particular Calling as I ought to have done; neither do I know that the work of Grace was at that time wrought in my heart: When I was Batchelor of Arts, my Father (having small means) took me from the University again: and immediately after my return home, I fell sick of the Small Pox, and was so full of them, not only outwardly, but in my Throat also, that my Father despaired of my Recovery: yet it pleased my heavenly Father to restore me, beyond his expectation: shortly after I was sent for to a Gentlemans in the Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land part of the Country, to teach his Children, and to be assistant to Mr. <hi>Slader,</hi> Minister of <hi>Knowle,</hi> a godly and eminent Man: yet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily wherein I lived was very prophane; which not agreeing with my former Education, though it dis-relished at the first, yet by degrees I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested it better; but after I had continued in that Family somewhat more than a year, I was unexpectedly sent for (in the midst of Winter) into <hi>Cheshire,</hi> to be an assistant to Mr. <hi>Byrom,</hi> Parson of <hi>Thornton,</hi> with whom I continued almost two years; and by reason of some Suits in Law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was intangled, I was put upon Preaching twice a Sabbath a great part of that time.</p>
               <p>In that Family I was cast upon some great temptations: but it pleased the Lord in mercy to hedge up my way with Thorns, and by striking me with extraordinary fear and terrour (as he did <hi>Belshazer</hi> by the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing) he made me to reflect upon my self, humbled me for my sins, and by degrees gave me some comfort in believing, and applying the Promises of free Grace in Christ Jesus: yet still I was dogg'd by Sathan, who often interrupted me in my secret Duties: and one of his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62667:4"/> was also raised up to prosecute me in the Chancellours Court at <hi>Chester,</hi> for the omission of some Ceremonies: so that receiving divers discouragements, I resolved to leave that place; and being importuned by some Friends at <hi>London</hi> to come thither, I went to <hi>Chester</hi> at <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmas</hi> Fair, with a purpose of sending my Trunk to <hi>London,</hi> and shortly after to have followed my self: But some godly Christians, Inhabitants of <hi>Wirrall,</hi> a Pemnsula beyond <hi>West-Chester,</hi> which had been my fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Hearers at <hi>Thornton,</hi> meeting me at the Fair, importuned my coming to <hi>Shotwick</hi> amongst them; and would receive no repulse till I had granted their desires. That Country is about fourteen Miles long, and five broad: there were divers godly, and understanding Christians scattered up and down in it: scarce a constant Preacher besides my self: so that, as my means of maintenance came by a voluntary contribution out of all those Christians Purses, so all of them within six, or seven miles compass, repaired to my Ministry, both Young and Old, Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Wet and Dry, Summer and Winter, to their very great pains and labour: spending the time between the Sermons in Repetition, singing of Psalms, and godly conference: and as they took extraordinary pains for the Word, so they highly prized it, and much profited by it. I also set up monthly Sacraments, and we enjoyed much sweet liberty, and Communion in the same. And besides these publick Ordinances, we had once in three Weeks ordinarily a day of Conference, unto which repaired all the Professors, both Men and Women, out of all the Country; and this Meeting was held by turns at all the richer mens Houses: in the Morning when they firstmet, the Master of the Family began with Prayer, then was the question to be conferred of read, and the younger Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans first gave in their answers, together with their proofs of Scripture for them; and then the more experienced Christians gathered up the other answers which were omitted by the former; and thus they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till Dinner time, when having good provision made for them by the Master of the Family, they dined together with much chearfulness; after Dinner, having sung a Psalm, they returned to their Conference upon the other questions (which were three in all) till towards the Evening; at which time, as the Master of the Family began, so he concluded with Prayer, and I gave them three new questions against their next Meeting; which being appointed for time and place, every one repaired to his own home: the benefits which came by these days of Conference, were many and great:</p>
               <p>First, Hereby knowledge was wonderfully increased, so that I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acquainted with more understanding Christians in all my Life, though the best of them went but in Russet Coats, and followed Husbandry. Secondly, Holy affections by this mutual whetting of them each in other, were exceedingly kindled, and kept alive in them. Thirdly, Love, by frequent Society, was nourished and increased; so that all the Professors, though living ten or twelve miles asunder, were as intimate and familiar, as if they had been all of one houshold. Fourhly, The necessities of the poorer sort being made known, there was plentiful provision made for them. Fifthly, The weak were strengthned, the mourning comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the erring reclaimed, the dejected raised up, and all of them mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually edified in their most holy Faith. Sixthly, Under the pretence of these Meetings, we enjoyed the opportunities, as occasion was offered,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62667:4"/> of private Fasts, and days of Thanksgiving, which otherwise would quickly have been taken notice of, and suppressed.</p>
               <p>In this place I found the first Seal of my Ministry, by being an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Conversion of many Souls to God: Amongst these persons I had abundance of comfort by their hearty Prayers for me, intire affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to me, and care for to provide for me, that I might subsist comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably amongst them. Whilst I was in this place, God disposed of me in Marriage to an holy, humble, prudent, and sweet natured Yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, unto which (of all the outward mercies I ever enjoyed from God) none is to be compared; she came of Religious Parents, her Father was a godly and faithful Minister at <hi>Bedworth</hi> in <hi>Warwick-shire.</hi> But after I had continued about the space of five years in this place, where we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed so much comfort and happiness, the Devil envying the same, raised up some of his instruments to complain of, and to prosecute me in the Chancellors Court, who was maliciously bent against God and Goodness, and who so much maligned me for the omission of Ceremonies; and was so violently bent against me, that he would not suffer me to Preach a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Sermon to my People: But behold the sweet Providence of God! just at the same time when I was thus molested, there came a Letter to me from the Mayor, Aldermen, old Mr. <hi>Fenn,</hi> and some other godly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Coventry,</hi> importuning me to come to Preach a Lecture in that great City; divers of them having heard me not long before at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fast, which I kept at <hi>Woolston.</hi> After I had sought to God and Friends for advice, I resolved to embrace that Call, the Door being shut against me where I was, and another, as I apprehended, opened there: But when I was to leave that People, it caused much grief to them and me, and with abundance of Tears on both sides, we were (as it were) torn asunder.</p>
               <p>At my coming to <hi>Coventry,</hi> I was entertained with much love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; there for a while, I exercised my Ministry: But neither there would the Devil fuffer me to be quiet long; for at that time there was Dr. <hi>Buggs,</hi> who had engrossed both the Livings (there being but two Parishes in that great City) he (as it seemed) seeing his Hearers go from him, soon professed himself my Enemy; and having power of both the Pulpits, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me entrance into either: whereupon the Mayor and Aldermen, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving another Church at an end of the Town in their disposal, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed my Lecture there: But Dr. <hi>Buggs</hi> having his spies to watch me, both in my Prayers and Sermons; conceived that he had gotten some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages against me, for some expressions used by me in the same.</p>
               <p>Hereupon he became an eager prosecutor of me before the Bishop of the Diocess (who was Dr. <hi>Morton)</hi> who inhibited me from Preaching in his Diocess: but having a Licence from the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury [Abbot,]</hi> I refused to obey his Inhibition: some of the Aldermen also of the City sticking to me, pretending to spend much money before I should be put down: shortly after the Bishop going to <hi>London,</hi> caused me to be cited up to the Court of Arches, whither I went, but he put in nothing against me: and when I went to him at his Lodgings, he first by perswasions, and after by menaces, laboured to have me relinquish the place; professing, that he would kneel before the King, but he would have my Licence called in: yet I resolved to keep it as long as I could, and returned to <hi>Coventry</hi> again; where a new Mayor being chosen, who was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62667:5"/> a great Friend to Dr. <hi>Buggs,</hi> the zeal of the Aldermen in standing for me, and by me, was much cooled; whereupon my Lecture fell to the Ground, and I assisted my Father every Sabbath, who lived within four Miles of the City: the Door being thus shut against me at <hi>Coventry,</hi> I was by a good Providence of God unexpectedly sent for by <hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> (who was then a young Man, and unmarried) to bestow a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon him at his House in <hi>Wedgnock</hi> Park, not far from <hi>Warwick;</hi> whither (though with much reluctancy, he being a stranger to me) I went, and preached before him, and found such approbation, that he desired me to be his houshould Chaplain; but such a Life not suiting with my estate (being married) nor with my Affections, with humble thanks I refused it, yet found him a fast, and a faithful Friend to me all his Life after.</p>
               <p>Much about the same time also I was sought for by the Magistrates of <hi>Warwick;</hi> to Preach a Lecture there on the Sabbaths in the Afternoon, and on <hi>Tuesday</hi> Mornings; but Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> the then Vicar of that place, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it: whereupon the Bailiff and Burgesses made their Address to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who was their Recorder, who sent for me up to <hi>London,</hi> heard me Preach, gave me his Qualification to be his Chaplain; and wrote so to Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> that being over-awed by his Letter, he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of me for his assistant: In that place I exercised my Ministry about the space of five years, and the Lord was pleased so to bless my Labours, that I got much room in the hearts of all the godly in the Town, and was the instrument of the conversion of some Souls: as also of much good in the Lord <hi>Brooks</hi> Family, who being then married, lived for the most part in <hi>Warwick</hi> Castle: but these things proved the object of Mr. <hi>Halls</hi> envy, who sought to pick quarrels with me, caused me often to be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented for the omission of Ceremonies, yet the Bishop [Dr. <hi>Thornbury]</hi> being an old Man, and peaceable, dealt so fairly, that still I got off: at length Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> being impatient of my continuance, came to pull me out of the Pulpit, and by his clamours and noise, so interrupted me, that I was forced to give over: and Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> being then made Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he in his old Age made a Journey to <hi>London,</hi> complained of me to the Archbishop: and threatened to prosecute me in the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission Court: yet it pleased the Lord so to order things, that I heard no more of it: Just about this time the Parson of <hi>Alcester</hi> dled; and the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> having formerly of his own accord, proffered that Rectory to me, did now as freely confer it upon me; whither I went, Preached to the People, and was freely and unanimously chosen by them for their Pastor; whereupon I took Institution and Induction into the place; and there exercised my Ministry in peace, and with good success for a time.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Town was placed in the midst of many great Papists, which made it their Randezvous: and for want of a powerful Ministry, the Inhabitants of the Town were much given to Swearing, Drunkenness, and prophanation of the Sabbath, opening their Shops, and selling Wares (especially Meat) publickly, it pleased God to bless my Ministry, and private Labours for the Reforming of those things: but neither did the Devil suffer me to be long in quiet there: for the Book of sporting upon the Sabbath, came forth about that time, and I was often enjoined the Reading of it, and much threatned for the refusal; and was the more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62667:5"/> envied and maligned, because all the Ministers thereabout (whereof some were godly) submitted to the reading of it: yet it pleased God (who had a great work to do in that place) to preserve my Liberty, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding my refusal; and the Lord added divers to the Church by my Ministry at that time.</p>
               <p>Also about that time, I having Preached largely upon the Doctrine of the Sabbath for half a year together, it pleased God to shew a remarkable Judgment upon two of my Neighbours; who encouraged by that Book, and in contempt of my Ministry, dared to prophane that holy day; the one was a Lusty young Woman, Daughter to <hi>Jo. Waldren,</hi> who said that she would go to such a Green in the next Parish, and there Dance as long as she could stand; which also on the Sabbath in the Afternoon she did; but as she was Dancing, it pleased the Lord to strike her with a sudden, and grievous Disease, whereof she died within three days: the other was a young man, one <hi>Charles Bellers,</hi> of whom read the story also in my Book of Examples, <hi>p.</hi> 153. These remarkable Judgments seconding of the Word, struck a great awe in the hearts of many, to the restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them from the like disorders. A while after came on the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops Visitation by Sir <hi>Nathanael Brent,</hi> unto whom Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> and some others, made many and great complaints of me; yet by a Letter from Mr. <hi>Ri. Knightly</hi> of <hi>Fausly</hi> to Sir N. <hi>Brent</hi> in my behalf, it pleased God to deliver me from that Snare also. Thus through Gods mercy, I continued the exercise of my Ministry in that place for about the space of nine years; in which time very many young persons, both Men and Women, were converted, held their Meetings on the Sabbaths in the Evening to repeat Sermons, and perform such Duties; others were edified and built up in their Faith: and the Town, which before was called Drunken <hi>Alcester,</hi> was now Exemplary, and eminent for Religion all over the Country: and upon all occasions when publick works of mercy were called for, their zeal and forwardness provoked many others. And thus we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the <hi>Etcetera</hi> Oath came forth; which as a dark and black cloud, threatned new dangers: but that being so gross and palpable, many of the Ministers of that Diocess met, and drew up a Petition to the King against it, and my self, and Mr. <hi>Arthur Salwey,</hi> were chosen, and request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry it: hereupon we went to <hi>York,</hi> the King being there with his Army, which lay in a Leaguer about the City, the <hi>Scots</hi> Army being at <hi>New-Castle.</hi> About this time the King had summoned all the Nobility to come to him to <hi>York;</hi> and upon their request, had promised to call a Parliament, to debate and determine the difference between him and the <hi>Scots:</hi> The next day after we came to <hi>York,</hi> we were present at the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor▪house, whilst the King was at Supper; and immediately after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I kneeling down, presented the Petition to the King, in the name of the Ministers of the Diocess of <hi>Worcester:</hi> the King received it without speaking a word, and went into his withdrawing Room; there was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Dr. <hi>Curle</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who frowned extreamly upon me for the Petition: yet I encouraged Mr. <hi>Salwey,</hi> and we followed the King to expect an answer. At the Door of the Chamber, the Porter told us that we could not be admitted; but I told him, that we had presented a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to the King, and must attend an answer; whereupon he let us pass. When we came into the Room, the King had laid our Petition on the Table, without Reading it, and was standing by the Fire, discoursing about his Army: we pressed just before him, and so stood confidently in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62667:6"/> his sight, till he observing that we would have no nay, went to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, took up our Petition, and read it distinctly over: after which he called Mr. <hi>W. Munay</hi> of the Bed-chamber, and gave him the Petition, bidding him to give it to the Master of Requests to return us our answer: then did we retire to our Lodgings; and afterwards repairing to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Requests, he told us; that the Kings answer was, That we should not be molested about the refusal of the Oath, till the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; at which time our Petition should be considered: After this we retired home, though through some dangers by reason of some stragling Soldiers. The Parliament beginning shortly after, the Ministers of our Diocess met again, drew up a Petition to the Parliament for the freeing of us from the snare of the Oath, and some other burthens that lay upon us; and my self and Mr. <hi>Salwey,</hi> were again requested to present, and prosecute the Petition; which we undertook and effected. At <hi>London</hi> we met with many Ministers from most parts of the Kingdom; and upon some Meetings and Debates, it was resolved, that a Committee should be chosen to draw up a Remonstrance of our grievances, and to Petition the Parliament for Reformation; which was accordingly done, and a Reformation was begun, though God for our sins, afterwards blasted our hopes, and brought us into the greatest confusion, that ever the Church laboured under since the first Reformation of Religion under Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Not long after, the differences between King and Parliament grew so high, that both parties betook themselves to Arms. Whereupon, after a while, upon a special occasion, I went to <hi>London,</hi> and having been a while there (yet with a purpose of returning) I was one day talking with my Sister <hi>Sutton,</hi> whom I met about the <hi>Mercers-Chappel</hi> in <hi>Cheapside:</hi> and whilst we were talking together, came by Mr. <hi>Thomas Clendan,</hi> whom I had formerly known, but had now forgotten; my Sister telling me who it was, I desired her to call him back, that I might renew my acquaintance; which she did: and as we were talking together, God by his providence so ordered it, that there came by two of <hi>Bennet Fink</hi> Parish, honest men; which Mr. <hi>Clendan</hi> stopping, said to them: You want a Minister, and if you can prevail with this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, you will be well fitted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hereupon I was requested to give them a Sermon the Sabbath following; which I assented to, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what God intended by it: There had about ten others Preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, for the place: amongst whom Dr. <hi>Hoile,</hi> old Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> of the Assembly, and Mr. <hi>F. Bellars,</hi> &amp;c. and the chiefest in the Parish were for Mr. <hi>Carter;</hi> and whereas some of the Parish urged to proceed to a choice; the other party put it by till the last <hi>Wednesday</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> which was the monthly Fast; against which time they had procured Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> to Preach in the Afternoon; and so they were immediately to proceed to the choice, whilst his gifts in Prayer and Preaching, had left an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon the Peoples Spirits, that they might the easilier bring him in. Accordingly when they vvere met in the Vestry, the debate vvas, vvho should be put into nomination; and all agreed that Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bellars,</hi> and my self, should be set dovvn in a paper, to vvhich they vvere to make their marks: Mr. <hi>Bellars</hi> had but one or tvvo hands; and for Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> there vvas Mr. <hi>Greene</hi> a Parliament man, and some six more of the greatest of the Parish, before any appeared for me: but then a godly man beginning, so many of the rest follovved, that the choice vvent clearly on my side. All this vvhile I knevv nothing hereof, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62667:6"/> what they were about: being not acquainted with any one in the Parish, nor imploying any Friend to speak to them in my behalf: But that day I Preached at <hi>Fish-street</hi> for Mr. <hi>J. Smart;</hi> and in the Evening, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping there, there came a Committee from <hi>Bennet Fink</hi> Parish, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with my free Election, and to intreat me to accept of the place: taking notice of the concurring Providences of God, I durst not refuse the Call; yet reserved my self free to return to <hi>Alcester</hi> when the Storm was over, and that I might do it with safety.</p>
               <p>The Wars being ended, I went into <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> and Preached on the Lords-day at <hi>Alcester,</hi> and many of the People with Tears importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my return: During the Wars, many of the Inhabitants of the younger sort, had retired to <hi>Warwick</hi> for safety; where, falling into the Company of Anabaptists, and other Sectaries, they were levened with their Errors; and being now returned home, they had set up pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meetings, with the neglect of the publick; and many young Men, whom I looked upon before, as Children begotten by my Ministry to God, were turned Preachers: whereupon, before I would promise to return, I propounded some Articles to them, concerning their owning me for their Pastor, attending upon my Ministry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; whereupon I promised to return to them the Spring following (this being at the latter end of Summer) But these Sectaries under-hand wrought against me, and grew higher in the ways of separation; so that finding the love of the People towards me here, the opportunities that I had of being instrumental to the publick good, and the unlikeliness of living comfortably at <hi>Alcester,</hi> having provided a godly able Minister for them, I resigned to him, and resolved to fix at <hi>Bennet Fink.</hi>

               <p>Your Majesties Loyal Subjects, many of the Ministers in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> have commanded us humbly to present this their gratulatory Acknowledgment to your Royal Majesty, for your gracious Condescensions, in your Majesties late Declaration concerning Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Affairs. The King took my Paper, and returned this answer:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, <hi>I will endeavour to give you all satisfaction, and to make you as happy as my self:</hi> and something more to the like purpose.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I was also seven or eight years a Governour in <hi>Sion</hi> Colledge, whereof two years I was President.</p>
               <p>I mention these things, not seeking my own Praise and Glory, (for I am less than the least of all God's Mercies) but to give Glory to God, who enabled and strengthened me to do so much work; wherein (I hope) I was serviceable to him and his Church, without the neglect of my work in the Ministry.</p>

               <p>Thus through Gods mercy, I continued the exercise of my Ministry for the space of forty years, even till the black Act for Conformity took place; which turned me, and almost two Thousand godly and painful Ministers and Schoolmasters out of their places. After which (though I durst not separate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor was satisfied about gathering a private Church out of a true Church, as I judge the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be, yet) I intermitted not my private Studies; but spent most of my time in Reading, Writing, and enlarging the Books which I formerly Printed, or Composing new: And if it please God that the remainder of my Cases of Conscience, and my <hi>Flores Theologiae,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place-Book,</hi> shall ever be Printed, I doubt not but they will prove as grateful and useful (if not more) than any I have Printed already.</p>

When he first came down in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he complaining, that he had lain in a Feavor all Night: yet found no great alteration in himself that day: but within two or three days he grew very weak, and was confin'd to his Bed: and then the decays of Nature (like so many Creditors, who had bin put off a great while, so that when once their Debter is seiz'd upon, they lay all their Actions against him, that they may be sure to keep him fast: so these) fell violently upon him, so that his strength was quite gone, and he was unable to help himself, and he began to falter in his Speech, yet the use of his understanding remain'd to the last. And as upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, at other times hee'd be speaking of his Change, so now more especially his Communication was savoury, and such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a dying Person, and one that had a sense of Eternity upon his Spirit; yea, and a comfortable assurance of his own title to a blessed Eternity. And so upon <hi>Dec.</hi> 25. 1682 having blessed those that were about him, he resign'd up his Soul into the hands of his Father, and fell asleep in the Lord: being aged eighty three years, two months, and fifteen days.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have disswasives and perswasives to this kind of History, the Lives of Wise and holy Persons: The disswasives are, that it may tempt men to think that such Instances are Rarities, and that Saints are so few, that we may with the Papists, Canonize them, and call only a few extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Votaries, the Religious. Whereas none but true Saints can be saved; And God in wonderful mercy hath raised up so great a number in our days, and of our acquaintance, as makes even this Earth the less grievous to us, which is salted, perfumed and enlightened by their Graces.</p>
            <p>In this it is with me, as it was about the success of my Ministry: when before my publick Preaching, and two years after, God blessed my endeavours with the Conversion of now and then one Soul, <note n="(*)" place="margin">Malignant I mean not turning them to Sects or odd Opinions, but to a holy and heavenly mind and life, from the love of sin and transitory vanity.</note> I used with thankfulness to write them down: But when he turned multitudes, from ignorance, pride and a carnal mind to holy Obedience, I gave over keeping a Catalogue, for it was no rarity: so when my excellent holy Friends dyed, I could have wished that the World for imitation, had known them as I did, and that their Lives had been published; But when I lived in the Acquaintance and Communion of multitudes of such, I saw that it would have been a partial, or an endless work? For Gods Graces are much the same in all his holy ones. O how great a number of holy persons of my Acquaintance, of exemplary Lives could I name, that God hath taken to himself of <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north, Dudley, Kederminster, Bewdeley, Stourbridge,</hi> other parts of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester-shire, Coventry, London,</hi> &amp;c. When we describe their Humility, Piety, soundness of Judgment, Fidelity, Peaceableness, Concord, secret and open Holiness, Sobriety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we must speak over the same things of all.</p>
            <p>But yet the Perswasives are not invalidated by this. For 1. Some persons live where prejudice, or the prohibition of Superiours, hath kept them unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such persons; And they need Information from those that knew them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We live in a time of mental War, when it is the Devils great and daily business to belie the best of men, and make the ignorant believe that they are a Generation of walking Plagues, movers of Sedition, teaching men to Worship God contrary to the Law, enemies to <hi>Caesar,</hi> Preaching up another King, one Jesus, and turning the World upside down, not keeping the Tradition of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; The Cry is loud, <hi>Away with such Fellows from the Earth; It is not fit that they should live.</hi> Most odious Lies are published of them with so great confidence, as that Strangers may think they are bound to believe them, lest they should censure the reporters to be what they are. And so much of God, of Christ, of the Holy Ghost, of the Gospel and of Religion, and of the Church and Souls of men, doth lie upon the true representation of the Faithful, and the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Gods Image upon them, and confuting Satans lies, as that it is no small part of the Duty of all Christs Servants to endeavour it: especially by their own holy and harmless Lives, which will most effectually plead their cause. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands are harden'd in sin, yea in enmity against a holy Life, yea in persecution, by believing serious Godly men, to be as bad as the Carnal World, a humorous,
<pb facs="tcp:62667:9"/> proud, seditious, hypocritical sort of People! They that dare not accuse God, or Christ or Scripture, dare accuse them that obey it: because the best have faults, and Hypocrites are among them, and their malice hath more matter to work upon. And yet when they grow ripe they will venture to charge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, of obscurity and insufficiency first, and next of falshood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And God will have the memory of the just to be blessed, and the names of the wicked to rot. <hi>Justin, Cyprian, Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Chrysostom, Martin,</hi> and many such, were men hated and persecuted by Princes and other Prelates, while they lived; yet hath God made their Memories honourable, and the Names of their Persecutors odious to good men: And though their Enemies have been oft and long in greatest power and numbers, they could never turn the stream of Honour.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is the Custom of the Devil to write infamous Lies of the best men when they are dead, which would be believed if those that knew them while they lived, did not say that which should refute the lies. What monstrous Lies have the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists written of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Calvin, Bucer Martyr, Beza,</hi> &amp;c. which a true History of their Lives hath shamed, with all judicious men that read them. The same I may say of many of late times in this Land. I have <hi>Cartwrights</hi> own answer to Dr. <hi>Sutliffe</hi> in <hi>M. S.</hi> which doth so fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the shameful story of his Confederacy with <hi>Hacket, Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington's,</hi> as will shame the slanderers to any impartial Reader. <hi>Rivet</hi> was fain to bring Certificates from the Magistrates and Records of the Town in <hi>France</hi> where <hi>Calvin</hi> lived, to disprove the lyers that publisht him a stigmatized <hi>Sodomite;</hi> He that eat but one very little Meal a day, and almost macerated himself (as even <hi>Massonius</hi> testifies) was by Papists reported to be a Glutton. <hi>Bucer</hi> was said to be killed and torn in pieces by the Devil, when all his sickness and pious dying is fully testified by <hi>Cambridge</hi> Doctors. And what do you think those who now in Press and Pulpit make such whose Lives this History recordeth (to be odious Rogues, not fit to live out of a Common Gaol) will say of them when they are dead? But those that knew them are safe from believing it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And this kind of work is of greater benefit and charity to ignorant ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, than to the dead or any other living. The Dead are above it: The Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful need it not: But as Christ saveth Souls by imprinting on them the Image of holy Love, so Satan damneth Souls by drawing them from such Love, to hate their Brethren, even the best: And he that hateth his Brother is a murderer, and no murderer hath Eternal Life.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And Nature is delighted in History. And the World is dolefully abused by false History, specially Ecclesiastick: And the true History of exemplary Lives, is a pleasant and profitable recreation to young persons; and may secretly work them to a liking of Godliness and value of good men, which is the beginning of saving Grace: O how much better work is it, than Cards, Dice, Revels, Stage-Plays, Romances or idle Chat.</p>
            <p>As to this work, I commend it to the Reader as principally for the foresaid use; so from so much knowledge as I have had of the Author and of the persons and things here recorded.</p>
            <p>The Author was well known to be a man of great sincerity, a hater of lying, and great lover of truth: And of long experience and great acquaintance in many parts of the Land; especially <hi>Cheshire, Warwick-shire</hi> and <hi>London.</hi> My acquaintance with him hath been long, though not much, because of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting distances. On <hi>October</hi> 23. 1642. little knowing what was doing at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> I was Preaching in his Pulpit at <hi>Alcester,</hi> on those words <hi>[The Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence.]</hi> My Voice hindered me, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
<pb facs="tcp:62667:9"/> heard the Canon: That Night was past by us in sad Watching, with the noise of Fugitive Troops: The next day, (such spectacles being rare, and sad) Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> and I rode to the Field to see what was done, where we saw the dead Bodies of English Men slain by one another. I after lived in <hi>Coventry,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> oft was: And where his very humble, godly, chearful old Father-in-Law, Mr. <hi>Overton,</hi> a Minister above 80 years of age, was with many other excellent men, one of my frequent Company: Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> went to <hi>London,</hi> and there was Pastor of a small Parish, <hi>Bennet Fink:</hi> When the King Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned us to treat for Concord with the Bishops, he was daily with us; and had the chief hand in drawing up the Exceptions against the Liturgy (at which I was absent.) In 1662. on <hi>September</hi> 10, he married me in <hi>Bennet Fink</hi> Church, in the presence of Alderman <hi>Ashhurst</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Ashhurst:</hi> After that; when the Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgeman</hi> by a favourable Exposition drew twenty Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Ministers to take the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath, he resolved to be one, that he might leave the accusers of them as Disloyal, no pretence: But to shew that he did it not for any worldly advantage, presently left <hi>London,</hi> and lived privately at <hi>Thistleworth</hi> to his death, bearing not only his own low estate with patience, but his worthy Sons also, who were sufferers with him, Ejected by the Act of Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
            <p>I never saw him since, nor heard that he came to <hi>London,</hi> but by a Letter from him a year before he died he told me he was 82 years old.</p>
            <p>He hath done great Service by former History. One Volume of Lives, and an <hi>Epitome</hi> of <hi>Martyrology,</hi> and a Volume of <hi>God's strange Judgments upon great Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Enemies deride him for Writing Lives with no more Art: But I take that to be his Commendation; He did not make the Histories, but take them made by faithful acquaintance of the dead: And he was not to patch or paint the dead, nor to add any thing of his own, but to deliver naked truth: some good men say, that many of the Lives of excellent men in his first Book are short and dry: That's our loss, but none of his fault: If all had done as Mr. <hi>Thomas Ball</hi> did by his Tutor Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> that defect had been fully satisfied: I was going to get from old <hi>Sam. Hildersham,</hi> some additions to his Father <hi>Arthur's</hi> Life, but his death frustrated me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melchior Adam</hi> hath done in my judgment very great Service to the Church in his four Volumes, the Lives of the <hi>German</hi> Divines, Philosophers, Lawyers and Physicians: But some he hath done copiously and excellently, and very many (of the three last sort) so exactly as to be next to nothing: And how could he help it? To have made Stories himself had been unworthy a Historian, so is it in this case.</p>
            <p>I have not read over this Book, being desired suddenly to write this Preface; and therefore undertake not the Justification of what I have not read: But I knew so many of the Persons and Histories my self, as makes me not doubt but the Reader will have no cause to question the Historical truth: And the rather because I see Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> is but the reciter of other mens words, and the Collector into one Volume of many mens Lives before published; some more being now newly added, at least which I never saw. <hi>Goldastus</hi> and abundance such Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, have done great Service in keeping many small Tractates from being lost. <hi>John Janewaies</hi> life, and <hi>Joseph Allens</hi> I had a hand in Publishing and Presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing heretofore: And O that I could reach that heavenly frame of mind, by which they lived and died in triumphant joy and praise to God! Dr. <hi>Sam. Boston,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Machin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Staunton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stockton,</hi> I knew: Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> was so well known (whose worthy Daughter
<pb facs="tcp:62667:10"/> Mrs. <hi>Corbet</hi> hath lived with me formerly, and this year and half) that the History hath full evidence. Judge <hi>Hales</hi> and the Countess of <hi>Warwick</hi> (my great Friends) need no testimony of mine. I knew not of his Epitomizing my Wives life; but the manner of that tells me he is like to be faithful in the rest: His worthy Son addeth his own Life, which he found written by himself.</p>
            <p>I have desired the Book-seller to Reprint the Life of the Countess of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> written by Bishop <hi>Rainbow,</hi> yet living, as an excellent pattern to Ladies; the Book being not easily to be got.</p>
            <p>I have in Funeral Sermons and Epistles described truly many excellent persons, whose Examples would be useful to this depraved Age; were it not for the charge of Printing, I would wish them Bound all together as these be, <hi>viz.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Bakers</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Coxes,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Hanmers,</hi> my Wives Mother, Alderman <hi>Ashhursts,</hi> Mr. <hi>Waddesworth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Corbets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It's a great work to learn to die, safely and comfortably; even the work of all our lives: my turn is near, and this preparation is my daily Study: But its the Communication of life, light and love from Heaven, that must make all effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and draw up our Hearts and make us ready: For which I daily wait on God. At the brink of the Grave, and door of Eternity</p>

                  </note> and Taught the Language in the University to divers Scholars. This himself mentioneth, but nameth not the man, in his Prefatory Speech to his Lectures, which he Read in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, of which we shall hear afterwards. <hi>I</hi> (saith he) <hi>being requested to Read, thought no place fitter than this, because I was informed that a Learned Man of</hi> France, <hi>about</hi> 23 <hi>years ago, did Read here in the</hi> Hebrew Tongue. <hi>At my first coming to</hi> Cambridge, <hi>I laid under him my first Foundations of that Study: And after him, it hath pleased God that I should come hither to revive his Studies. He was a very Learned Man, and in</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge <hi>was accounted Second to none in the Realm. A rare Man he was in that Study; and in</hi> Hebrew <hi>he would draw such a Study, that Men might Learn more of him in a Month, than others could teach in Ten Years: He, being requested by his Country-men, to return, and Preach the Gospel amongst them; and having gotten Leave of Her Majesty, he went; but being come thither, he was so Persecuted by Wicked Men, that he was driven to fly into the Hills and Woods, and thereby got an Ague, whereof he Died.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi>'s Parts and Learning here began to be taken notice of; and among others, <note place="margin">His Friends.</note> the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> especially cast a favourable Eye upon him, with a Noble Influence and Encouragement of all his Studies and Proceedings.</p>
               <p>From the University he came to <hi>London,</hi> where he Preached in Publick, and thereby <note place="margin">Comes to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> increased the number of his Friends, and those some of the highest Rank and Degree; and he followed his Studies so close, that when Diversions did not withdraw and interrupt him, he spent twelve, fourteen, nay, very commonly sixteen hours in the four and twenty every Day at his Book. The way of his Preaching was this: He would take a Text out of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and another Parallel in the <hi>New,</hi> and discourse largely upon them together, and knit up all in a short Application. And thus he went over very many, if not all the <hi>Sections</hi> in <hi>Moses,</hi> and conferred them, and the Prophets with the <hi>New Testament.</hi> And one Passage in one of these Sermons, which he had in his Application, may not be omitted: It was in <hi>Eighty Eight,</hi> when the <hi>Spanish Navy</hi> was upon the Sea: All the time of the <note place="margin">A Prediction.</note> danger, when mens Hearts were full of fears and doubts what the Event might be, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the People exceedingly, and once particularly thus: <hi>Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Papists knees Knock one against another, as the Knees of King</hi> Belshazzar <hi>did, and News will come that the Lord hath scattered that</hi> Invincible Navy. <hi>Fear ye not, nor be dismayed at these smoaking Firebrands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which made him most known to the World indeed, was the Publishing of his Book called, <hi>A Consent of Scripture,</hi> which he put forth the same year 1588. himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Thirty nine Years Old. Mr. <hi>John Speed</hi> (a Man well known) was Overseer of <note place="margin">Consent of Scripture.</note> the Press for its Printing; a Taylor he was by Trade: But by acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> he was grown very Studious in the Scriptures, and by his Directions was grown very skilful in them.</p>
               <p>In the time while the <hi>Consent</hi> was in Printing, he, by Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi>'s Directions, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all the <hi>Genealogies</hi> of the Bible into one view, and at the last they were Published un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Genealogies Printed.</note> his name, in the form we had then before our Bibles. But it was Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> that directed, and digested them, and there are yet fair <hi>Manuscripts</hi> of them to be shewed, some whereof have the Names in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and some in the <hi>Latine Letter,</hi> and some of them Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi>'s own hand: And one that attended him, <hi>Dorman,</hi> or <hi>Dalman,</hi> or such a like Name, had made such a Collection by the Direction of his Master, before Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> had collected his <hi>One View.</hi> And yet when the <hi>Genealogies</hi> came to be Published, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Bishops would not endure to have Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi>'s Name to be prefixed, Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> went away with all the credit and profit; so that he would confess, and it was no more than he had good reason to do; That Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> was a means, under God, of great Blessings unto him and his Children for worldly Comforts. And therefore that act of his may be wondred at, which himself confessed to some of Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi>'s Friends; namely, That he had as many <hi>Manuscripts</hi> of Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi>'s as he could hold in his Arms, and he held his Arms encompassed: <hi>But,</hi> saith he, <hi>I have burnt them all;</hi> what reason moved him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62667:23"/> so to do, he best knew: But certainly standers by, will hardly be satisfied that it was done like a Friend.</p>
               <p>No sooner was the <hi>Concent</hi> published, but it met with opposition by two eminent Men <note place="margin">His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> in the two Universities, Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lively</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who being <hi>Professors</hi> in those Universities, both of them read publickly against it. The Author of it did usually call it; <hi>His Little Book of great pains.</hi> And so it was indeed; for it cost him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years study, and when he Published it, his Pains was not at an end, but to begin anew. For the Lectures of those two Learned Men against it, put him to writing again in justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what he had published, and what they excepted against.</p>
               <p>It was some honour to Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> to have two <hi>Opponents</hi> of so great Name, worth, and Learning: But the greater their repute (&amp; that most deservedly) the greater was his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage that had to deal with them: And to this was added, that what he held, was Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and in every Mans hand: But what they read to the contrary, was only among their own <hi>Auditors,</hi> and nothing was published by them, whereby others might judge of the Controversy betwixt them, of a long time. Dr <hi>Reynolds</hi> indeed sent some Notes of his Readings, privately to Mr. <hi>Broughton;</hi> but printed nothing of them all his time, what was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished of them, was done after Mr. <hi>Broughtons</hi> Death, by Dr. <hi>John Burges</hi> of <hi>Sutton-Cofield,</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lively</hi> was answered privately by Mr. <hi>Thornton</hi> a Country Gentleman, and a Friend, and Follower of Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> as he could come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his exceptions. And so Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> undertook them both himself, as he could come to understand what it was that they opposed, and spent much pains in confirming his own Tenets, and confuting theirs.</p>
               <p>This opposition of his <hi>Concent,</hi> as also the intreaties of divers of his Friends, prevailed <note place="margin">He explains it.</note> with him to Read in private to them, his Explication of it, and he had <hi>Auditors</hi> to the number of eighty, ninty, or an hundred: sometimes more, sometimes less, and they kept their meetings weekly. At first indeed he Read in the <hi>East end of St. Pauls Church,</hi> where afterwards the Lord Mayor and his Brethren used to meet; and this he did with the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Queen and her Council, and some of the best Learned of the Bishops were his Friends. And the Council had the Names of those which were his Schollars, of what Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they were, how Qualified, and where they dwelt. But others of the Bishops would <note place="margin">Opposed by the Bishops.</note> not endure this, calling them <hi>Dangerous Conventicles,</hi> and complaining of them, caused them some trouble: so that at last they could read in <hi>Pauls</hi> no longer.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he Read in a large Chamber in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> but tarried not long there, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Mark-lane,</hi> and into some other places. And this was his course when he taught in private. His <hi>Auditors</hi> had every one of them <hi>The Concent</hi> before him, and he went on still in the exposition of it all along with the Bible, and bad his Auditors diligently to read the Scriptures, and keep themselves to the <hi>Chronology</hi> of it: and shewed what and how much they should Read against their next meeting, to be prepared for his discourse then. And withal handled the <hi>Geneallogies,</hi> as the matters of those Scriptures called for Explication for that time of the <hi>Chronology;</hi> that they might understand what Scriptures were contained within such a space of time. And still he shewed the Doctrine of Faith, and love of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> in every Age; how believed and practised by the Faithful, and who dispised them. And in his Application he would sum up all in a quarter of an hour, or more, as the matter required.</p>
               <p>Of these his Lectures there are still extant the Notes of four and thirty, and the Notes of nine of his Sermons, in which he <hi>Collated,</hi> the <hi>Sections</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> with the <hi>New Testament;</hi> all which were taken from his Mouth as he delivered them. An Extract out of which (of what is not in his other Writings) had been Printed and Published with his other Works, had not he that had the perusing of them in hand for that purpose, been prevented by a very long, and dangerous Sickness, with which he was seized at the very first setting of the Press on work.</p>
               <p>Thus he abode in <hi>London</hi> divers years from his first coming thither, and procured many Friends in the City, and made his residence for a long time, more especially among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the <hi>Cottons,</hi> who tendered and respected him very much, during his abode in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bounty of the <hi>Cottons.</hi>
                  </note> and forgat him not when he was beyond the Seas, but sent him frequent and large to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of their Love, even sometimes a hundred pounds at a time. There were four Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them; <hi>John, Roger, William,</hi> and <hi>Allen,</hi> which <hi>Allen</hi> was afterward L. <hi>Mayor of London;</hi> and he it was whom he meaned in those words in his Epistle to the Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and Governors of <hi>Oxford,</hi> saying; <hi>A Master of Art of your breeding being at</hi> London, <hi>and upon the Thames,</hi> Anno 1590. in a Boat with Mr. <hi>A. Cot:</hi> and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Roger Cotton,</hi> a Draper in <hi>Cannon-Street,</hi> was a true Schollar of this Master, and so
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62667:24"/> constantly plyed the sacred Scriptures, according to the Admonitions and directions that he had received from Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> that he Read over the Bible twelve times in one year, and what proficiency he made therein, he gave a <hi>Specimen</hi> of it in that little Book which he Published, called, <hi>Directions to the Waters of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Mr. <hi>William Cottons</hi> House he made his most constant residence, who also was a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and where his Lodging and Library were. In this Family he undertook the Education of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> eldest Son <hi>[Rowland,</hi> who was afterward Knighted] in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue; which he prosecuted with such good success, that there were few places in the Bible, which he was not able readily to Read, and to render into <hi>English</hi> when he was but seven or eight years old, and could very well and readily speak the <hi>Hebrew Language.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The way which he used to bring him on so forwardly was this. First, Himself spake in <hi>Hebrew</hi> to him constantly, and taught him by heart the passages and speeches, which were most usual in his ordinary converse: As to call for his Food, Cloths, and other necessaries: Also Phrases of salutations, and entertainments: Expressions of his Duty, and Affections to his Parents and Relations. Yea, the very passages which were most usual with Children at their Play. These he taught him to utter readily in that Language, and had a young Man, skilful in that Tongue, who was ever with him to interpret for him. This Noble Knight would oft relate that his Mother would sometimes be ready to weep, when he came to do his Duty to her, or to ask any thing of her, and might not speak it in <hi>English</hi> to her, that so she might have conferred with him, and talked to him again.</p>
               <p>To this, Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> drew up a <hi>Vocabulary</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>English</hi> for him, out of which he was dayly learning words. And he framed it, not in an <hi>Alphabetical</hi> way, as <hi>Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries</hi> and <hi>Lexicons</hi> usually are; But he first pitched upon a place or thing more general, and then named all the particulars in it, or belonging to it: As Heaven Angels, Sun, Moon, Stars, Clouds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So a House, Door, Window, a Parlor, a Celler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Field, Grass, a Flower, a Tree, Hedge, a Furrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Book is yet to be had, and might easily be obtained to be Printed, if it should be judged meet to be done.</p>
               <p>And to compleat all, he had him constantly with him in his Study, where he instilled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, first the <hi>Grammer,</hi> and then Read the Bible to him. And this learned Knight would often speak of one Book that he had in his Study, with which his Childish affection was then much taken, and that only for the Covers-sake. It was an old <hi>Manuscript,</hi> the whole Cover whereof was of Brass, as ours commonly are of Pastboard and Leather. And when he was come to Judgment, he concluded, that it was very likely to be some <hi>Manuscript</hi> of great rarity, and would often bemoan, that after Mr. <hi>Broughtons</hi> death, he could never hear of it.</p>
               <p>He would also often speak of another Book, which indeed, in the intention of his Master, he should have had. It was a very fair <hi>New Testament,</hi> either <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Syriack,</hi> he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred not which, noted throughout very largely with Mr. <hi>Broughtons</hi> own Hand, as to the unfolding of the Language, and Sense, and Collation with the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> This Book in his later time he would often shew him, and say: <hi>This I will leave to you for a Legacy, when I die; and see that you make much of it.</hi> But upon his Death it so vanished, that he could never see, nor hear of it more, although he used all the diligent enquiry after it, that possibly he could, and offered a Hundred pounds for it, if that would have purchased it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> having thus spent several years in <hi>London, An. Christi</hi> 1589. he went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">He goes into <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </note> into <hi>Germany,</hi> having before he went presented his <hi>Concent of Scripture</hi> to Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Majesty, to whom he had dedicated it. So he saith in an Epistle to Her Majesty: <hi>My pains in opening and declaring the</hi> Concent, <hi>which the Scripture hath, I humbly present to Your Majesty this,</hi> Novemb. 17. 1598.</p>
               <p>His Companion in his Travels was one Mr. <hi>Alexander Top,</hi> a young Country Gentleman, who put himself under his <hi>Tutorage,</hi> and travelled with him that he might be constantly under his Instructions. And afterwards Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> married a Neece of his, one Mrs. <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> a Gentlewoman that brought a good estate to him. And Mr. <hi>Top</hi> would oft tell him, that he knew not how otherwise to requite him for all the Love, Pains, and Observance that he had shewed to him in his Journey, and he doubted not, but he would find her such a Wife, as that he would account it a good requital. To this Gentleman it was that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Mordecai</hi> his Age under this <hi>Inscription, To his good Friend Mr. A. T.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Gentleman would oft speak of Mr. <hi>Broughtons</hi> exceeding great courage and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <note place="margin">His Courage.</note> and freedom in inveighing against <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Jesuitism</hi> among the <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and against <hi>Judaism</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> As once more especially at the B. of <hi>Mentz</hi> his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where also divers <hi>Jesuits</hi> were present, with whom he discoursed so freely, and sharply against the <hi>Papacy,</hi> as <hi>Antichristìan,</hi> and against the blindness and wickedness of the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62667:24"/> that the <hi>Protestants</hi> who were present with him, were afraid that he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered both himself and them. At another time, being in one of the <hi>Jews Synagogues,</hi> at the time of their Service, where their Publick Minister Read, and Prayed in a strange and uncouth Tone, one of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as he came out, said unto him; <hi>Did not our Minister Sing like an Angel?</hi> No (saith he) <hi>he Barked like a Dog:</hi> And so called for a Dispute with him, where they had long and much tugging.</p>
               <p>Also <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1589. he had a Dispute with <hi>Rabbi Elias</hi> in <hi>Frankford Synagogue,</hi> as <note place="margin">His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes.</note> himself relateth in his Tract, <hi>A Require of Consent,</hi> &amp;c. Some of the best Learned <hi>Jews,</hi> (saith he) <hi>have</hi> greatly desired to be taught our Gospel. One <hi>Rabbi Elias</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> did it whole one and twenty years, with whom in <hi>Frankford Synagogue</hi> (in the year 1589.) I Disputed, and drew all the Law to <hi>Christ;</hi> so that he denied nothing, but still desired to hear that matter enlarged. We Disputed under this Oath; <hi>That God would strike him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently that should speak against his own Conscience;</hi> whereupon he never denied any thing that I spake, only requested leave to propound his Doubts, and departed with a Desire to be taught by Printing. This our Conference was reported by <hi>Jews</hi> as far as to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and by farther Instigation, <hi>Rabbi Abraham Reuben,</hi> sent from thence his Epistle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1590. He was still in <hi>Germany;</hi> so himself saith in an Epistle to the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Oxford. A Dr.</hi> (saith he) <hi>of yours told Dr.</hi> Reynolds, <hi>when I was in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, <hi>in the year</hi> 1590. <hi>thus; Inibis parvum gratiam à Christianis, qui conatus es hanc Prophetiam</hi> Danielis <hi>labefactare. Praeterea, qui istic mos est invehi in absentem? Ille cui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicis, jam est in media</hi> Germania.</p>
               <p>He also mentioneth his being at <hi>Worms</hi> this year in his <hi>Treatise of Melchizedeck.</hi> And this same year he wrote his little Tract of <hi>Mordecai</hi> his Age to Mr. <hi>Top,</hi> who was then with him in <hi>Germany,</hi> the young Gentleman desiring satisfaction in that point. Probably they had heard what Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> had said upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1591. He was again in <hi>England.</hi> Probably he came over, that he might <note place="margin">His Return to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> make something of the Controversie betwixt that Dr. and him. They met at <hi>London,</hi> and referred the Umpirage of their Contest to the A. B. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and to Dr. <hi>Elmer,</hi> B. B. of <hi>London.</hi> See his Epistle to them, <hi>Dated in</hi> London <hi>Novemb.</hi> 4. 1591. But it seems that Reference came to nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1592. He was again in <hi>Germany,</hi> and (as it's likely) he continued there <note place="margin">Then into <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </note> after the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> He had some potent Adversary in her Court, who was a means to hinder him from the Preferment which the Queen intended him, and to obstruct her favour to him, and that bred danger and unsettledness to him in <hi>England,</hi> and this caused him to spend so much of his time in a strange Country. It may easily be gathered out of his Epistle to Queen <hi>Elizabeth, (pag.</hi> 727. of his Works) that his great <hi>Antagonist</hi> was the then A. B. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who also had laid wait to apprehend him, and offered a Sum of Money to him who would discover where he was.</p>
               <p>This year he published the <hi>Sinai-sight,</hi> which he Dedicated to the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> causing <note place="margin">His <hi>Sinai</hi>'s-sight.</note> it wholly to be Engraven in Brass, which cost him about an hundred marks. The Plates are yet to be had in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his Travels beyond Sea he was familiarly acquainted with <hi>Scaliger, Rephelengius, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</note>
                  <hi>Beza,</hi> and others the most Eminent for Learning in those Times. His Transactions with <hi>Pistorius, Nic. Serrarius,</hi> and other <hi>Jesuites,</hi> from whom he found more respect, than he did from some <hi>Protestants,</hi> especially from the <hi>Scholars of Geneva.</hi> His favour with the A. B. of <hi>Mentz,</hi> to whom he Dedicated his Translation of the <hi>Prophets</hi> into <hi>Greek.</hi> His having the offer of a <hi>Cardinals Cap</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi> and his many Disputes with several <hi>Rabbins.</hi> His Discourse before the Duke of <hi>Bovillion</hi> about the <hi>Descent into Hell,</hi> in the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Mentz,</hi> and divers other things, of which it were but superfluous to discourse here at large, and would but anticipate him that hath, or will Read his Works; and our chief intent here, is not to speak of those things which are obvious in his Works, but of those which are known only unto few, the whole stock of his Disciples, being now wholly worn out.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> in his <hi>Explication of the Apocalypse,</hi> speaketh of some Passages betwixt <note place="margin">He is prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalship.</note> himself, and some <hi>Jesuits</hi> at the Towns end of <hi>Mentz;</hi> and, among other things, saith thus; <hi>Upon this we turned to Read the Proselytes Letter; for whose Testimony, I might have had a Cardinalship Principal of</hi> Rome, <hi>one Mr.</hi> Murton <hi>of</hi> Yorkshire, <hi>desired me to go to</hi> Mentz <hi>with him, to hear what they said of it; where one of them took occasion (as they were speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Cardinals) to ask, what mine would have been worth? The other answered, About Eighteen thousand</hi> French <hi>Crowns. This Mr.</hi> Murton, <hi>however then written, was no other</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62667:25"/>

He would tell how he was with Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and was continually proposing some thing or other to him, wherein he desired to be resolved: And when he understood not some of his Answers, but required farther Explication, Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> would be angry, and call him <hi>Dullard,</hi> and <hi>Unlearned,</hi> and such like Names; whereupon Dr. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> took up this Custom, that, when he came to propose any Doubt to him, he would plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly say; <hi>I pray you, whatsoever Dolts and Dullards I am to be called, call me so before we begin, that your Discourse, and mine Attention be not interrupted thereby.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> took it as pleasantly from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> speaks oft of his Disputations with <hi>Rabbi Farrar,</hi> and to that which he writeth of it, thus much more may be added: That the same <hi>Rabbin</hi> wrote a Tract in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> to have confuted Mr. <hi>Brougbton</hi>'s Opinion about the Fourth <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which yet Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> never answered, either conceiving that he had already said enough upon that Subject in his former Writings, or else because he wanted either health, or leisure.</p>

               </p>
               <p>At this time of his abode there, Mr. <hi>Isaac Genius</hi> became his Scholar, who afterwards turned his <hi>Concent of Scripture</hi> into <hi>Latine,</hi> which he published <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1602. Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> himself overseeing the Work all along: And thus much may be observed from those words of his in the Epistle to the Reader, where he writes thus; <hi>Translatione hac meâ, meâ inquam, majore ex parte; nam ei plurima Author stilo suo addit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Boreel</hi> had turned his Exposition upon <hi>Daniel</hi> into <hi>Latine</hi> some three years before.</p>
               <p>Upon the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or shortly after, he returned into <hi>England,</hi> and was <note place="margin">His Return to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> in <hi>London</hi> at the time when the Plague raged sore there; and Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> going to visit Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> in that sad time, he was astonished to see him there in a time of so much danger. But Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> was very chearful, and spake much to his Edification and Comfort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God's afflicting hand upon the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1603. he Preached at <hi>Oatlands</hi> before Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> upon the <hi>Lord's</hi>

                  <hi>Prayer. Anno Christi</hi> 1607. the Translation of the Bible was begun: From which work, how he came to be secluded, whose Abilities that way were known so well, may rather be wondred at than resolved. He had spoken much concerning that Translation, for which he heareth ill of some, as if he shewed Indignation, because he was excluded; whereas Charity and Candour would construe, that what he had written, was in Zeal, and Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Truth. And doubtless if his Advertisements concerning some particular Texts had been taken, they had not been useless.</p>
               <p>He again made another Journey beyond the Seas, and made his abode there for a while, and was for some time a Preacher to the <hi>English</hi> in <hi>Middlebourg:</hi> And thither two of his <note place="margin">He goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </note> Followers in <hi>London</hi> [Mr. <hi>Ayre</hi> and Mr. <hi>Perry]</hi> went purposely to give him a visit; whom at first meeting he did a little chide, for taking so long, dangerous, chargeable, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a Journey. <hi>What?</hi> said they pleasantly; <hi>Is this the Entertainment you give us for our pains and visit?</hi> Then did he as pleasantly and lovingly embrace them, and entertained them heartily and affectionately during all the time of their abode with him.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was now beyond the Seas, he wrote that very sharp and smart Discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst A. B. <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and sent the whole Impression over to Mr. <hi>William Cotton</hi> (Younger Brother to Sir <hi>Rowland Cotton)</hi> then living in <hi>London;</hi> withal, intreating him, that if he durst adventure, he should deliver one of the said Books into the A. Bishop's own Hands. The Gentleman, though he foresaw the undertaking to be dangerous, because he could deny nothing to Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> undertook it, and made his <hi>Apology</hi> to the A. B. and told him that Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> had engaged him to do it, and therefore he begged his Lordships Pardon and Excuse, which also he obtained, and was fairly dismissed.</p>
               <p>But some Officers were immediately sent to his Lodging, to seize upon the Impression, which they did accordingly: But Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> foreseeing what would come to pass, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed a Trunk-full of them out of the way, whereby he escaped.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> having thus spent much of his time in Travels, at last he fell into a Cough <note place="margin">His Sickness and Return to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> of the Lungs, which encreasing upon him, caused his Return into <hi>England,</hi> as being desirous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62667:25"/> to die in his own Country; and accordingly in the Month of <hi>November, Anno</hi> 1611. he came to <hi>Graves-end;</hi> which being speedily made known to his Friends in <hi>London,</hi> divers of them went down to him thither, and brought him to the City. He told them, that he was come to die in his own Native Country; and his desire also was, if the Lord had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to die in his own Native County <hi>[Shropshire]</hi> and so had he oft told Sir <hi>Rowland Cotton</hi> afore this, that he intended to end his Days with him, if the Lord should permit, and so he told him now again at their meeting in <hi>London,</hi> that if his strength would give him leave, he would come down to him into <hi>Shropshire,</hi> and the noble Knight did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly accommodate Lodgings for him against his coming, suitable to his weak and sickly condition. But it pleased the Lord to prevent his Journey.</p>
               <p>He lodged in <hi>London,</hi> and kept all Winter with an old Friend, Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> in <hi>Cannon-Street,</hi> and in the Spring he was removed for fresh air to <hi>Totnam-High-Cross,</hi> to the House of one Mr. <hi>Benet,</hi> a Linnen-Draper in <hi>Cheapside.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although he had so tedious an infirmity, yet he spake, as he could, at times to his Friends <note place="margin">His Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> about many things, giving them many pious, and godly exhortations. He used these short Speeches to them very much: <hi>Study the Bible. Labour to save one another. Be peaceable. Meddle with your own matters. Some great Judgment will come upon this Kingdom. Never fear Popery: It shall never overflow again: But the course, which the Bishops take, will fill the Land with</hi> Atheism. <hi>Meddle not with the quarreling. Teach not the unwilling:</hi> many other such speeches he used. He went over all the Books of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> in a brief discourse of the sum of every one of them: But he was now so weak, being near his end, that his strength served him not to do the like by those of the <hi>New.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he drew near to Death, he told them that stood by him, that Satan had assaulted <note place="margin">His Death.</note> him: But (said he) <hi>the Son of God hath rebuked him, and hath spoken comfortable words to my Soul.</hi> A little before his Death two Friends came from <hi>London</hi> to visit him, and he could then speak to them, though very faintly. And after some stay with him, they took their leaves of him, not thinking that his end had been so near. But e're they came half way to <hi>London,</hi> a Messenger overtook them, and told them that Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> was speechless, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they hasted back again, and found it so; for they could get no words from him, yet when they asked him; <hi>Shall one of us pray by you?</hi> He, by lifting up his Hands, gave an evident sign of his consent, and fervent desire after it. And so they stayed with him till he Dyed: which was <hi>August</hi> the 4th, <hi>An. Ch.</hi> 1612. He being then in his <hi>Climacterical</hi> year, <hi>viz.</hi> 63.</p>
               <p>His Corps was brought to <hi>London,</hi> accompanied with a great multitude of People, of whom many had put themselves into mourning for his sake. He was interred in St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines Church, August</hi> the 7th, Mr. <hi>Speght,</hi> Minister of the Church in <hi>Milk Street,</hi> Preached his Funeral Sermon upon those words, <hi>John</hi> 11. 8. <hi>Lord, Behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</hi> It was said that the Bishops would not suffer his Sermon to be Printed.</p>
               <p>Of Personage he was graceful and comely: of a countenance that spake much studious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> and gravity, and the Picture of him prefixed before his Works, doth much resemble him, as such say who best knew him. He was indefatigably studious, which swayed his temper a little to austerity: and yet among his Friends, he was of a very sweet, affable, and loving carriage; sharp, and severe, and exceeding bold against Error, and Impiety, and would sharply reprove it, whatever it cost him. He was once travelling here in <hi>England,</hi> and being in his Inn, a Royster, in the room next to him, was swearing horribly, and at no measure: In went he boldly to him, and <hi>who art thou</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou Wretch, who darest</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note>
                  <hi>thus to Blaspheme, and profane the glorious Name of the Great God?</hi> And some other like words, which he set on with so great an awe, and boldness, that the Roarer became calm, and took his sharp reproofs (especially when he came to understand who he was) in very good part.</p>
               <p>He was free and communicative to any that desired to learn of him: But would withall be very angry with Scholars, if they did not readily understand him in his discourse, as thinking it a shame to them to be ignorant of such things. Among his Friends he would be very pleasant, especially at his Meals, at which time, if any at the Table proposed any serious Question to him, to be resolved on, he would commonly divert it with some other Questions, and that ordinarily, a pleasant one, to find the Table imployment in the discussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, till he had Dined, or Sup't, and then he would say: <hi>Now come and ask what Question you please: for now I am ready for you:</hi> and so would return to his serious discourse again.</p>
               <p>His stile of writing was curt, and something harsh, and obscure, because he affected <note place="margin">His Stile.</note>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62667:26"/> to speak much in few words: and besides that his natural <hi>Genius</hi> inclined him to such a stile, it's probable, that his much conversing with the <hi>Judaick Learning,</hi> did something mould, and habituate him that way. His rehearsing the same things often over, was occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the writing of his <hi>Treatises</hi> in several places, and having his discourses with several Persons, where the same things did almost inevitably occur and fall in: It were to be wished, that he had been more sparing in his own Praises, and less bitter in his invectives against his <hi>Antagonists:</hi> But if it be impartially considered how he was trampled under foot by some of the Bishops, and vilified by others upon their example, how he was by them kept from deserved Preferment, tossed up and down, troubled, disgraced, and endangered, you may very well allow some Grains of transportment, and liberty to so great a Scholar as he was, somewhat to forget himself. Those that read his Writings, which desire to profit by them, will pass over such things without offence, and cover such weaknesses with the Mantle of Charity, the rather because himself took notice of them, and upon his Death-Bed confessed, and acknowledged them to be his infirmities, whereof he repented. And withal he protested then, as he had often before, that they were rather strained from him by his Adversaries provocations, then flowing from his own disposition.</p>
               <p>In his Writings the serious and impartial Reader will find these two things. First, as much Light given to the Scriptures, especially into the most difficult passages of it, as is to be found in any one Author whatsoever: Nay, it may be, in all Authors together. Secondly, a winning, and inticing enforcement to the reading of the Scriptures, with a greater seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and more then ordinary searching into them. Among those that have studied his Books, many might be named, that have grown to be Proficients, so far as that they have attained to a most singular, and almost incredible skill, and readiness in his way, in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Bible, though otherwise unlearned Men. Yea, some such their were, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excited, and stirred up by his Books, applyed themselves to the study of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, and attained to a great measure of skill and knowledge therein. Nay, a Woman might be named that did it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Broughtons</hi> Writings do carry in them a kind of holy and happy <hi>Fascination,</hi> that the serious Reader of them, is won by a sweet violence, to look into the sacred Scriptures <note place="margin">His Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</note> with the greatest diligence and seriousness that is possible, and cannot chuse but do it. Let any one but set himself to read his Books in good earnest, and if he find not, that he sees much more in the Scriptures, then ever formerly he did, and that he is stirred up to search much more narrowly into them then ever he was before, he misseth of that, which was never mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of before, by any that took that course, if multitude of Experiences may have any Credit.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>RObert Boid</hi> of <hi>Trochreg,</hi> was descended of <hi>Robert Boid,</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">His Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</note> Protector of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whom in the fifth remove descended <hi>James Boid,</hi> Baron of <hi>Trochreg</hi> and <hi>Barniel,</hi> the Father of our <hi>Robert.</hi> He was born <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1578. and by his Father carefully educated in learning, and having profited in the <note place="margin">His Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> study of the liberal Arts, he commenced <hi>Master of Arts</hi> in the University of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> where also he was a diligent hearer of <hi>Robert Rollock,</hi> a famous Preacher in those daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1604. or thereabouts, he travell'd into <hi>France,</hi> and came to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where he staid but a while, because he had not the convenience there of frequenting religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, to which he was much addicted: and going from thence, he went to <hi>Thoarse,</hi> where Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> had been Minister for about 10 years; who most willingly entertain'd this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed young Man, especially when he understood that he was willing to undertake the instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certain noble Youths in a School lately founded in that place by him at the charge of the noble Duke <hi>Trumelian.</hi> This placc he discharged for a year and half with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, <note place="margin">His imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> and happy success; living all that while in great familiarity with <hi>Rivet,</hi> approving himself exquisite in learning unblameable in his Conversation, eminent in Piety, and of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular modesty. He was so diligent and industrious in his studies, that he spent whole nights <note place="margin">Industry.</note> and daies, so far as bis School would give him leave, in reading and writing, and borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers Books of Dr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> especially <hi>Greek</hi> Authors both in <hi>Prose</hi> and <hi>Verse,</hi> he made <note place="margin">Proficiency.</note> so good use of the same, gathering out of them whatsoever was worthy observation, that he throughly digested them, and became Master of them, whereby both <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> grew as familiar to him as his Mother Tongue; He was also no noviee in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and in that short space he grew so exact in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, that after a few years he might be reckon'd among the most eloquent, whether you respect the elegancies of that Language, or the pronunciation of it (a faculty, which few of his Countrymen use to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto) as many could witness, who a while after heard him Preach eloquently in the same.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Thoarse</hi> he went to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where <hi>Gilbert Primrose,</hi> his Countryman, was <hi>Pastor</hi> of the Reformed Church; a man deservedly famous; by whose means he lived there a year with a certain Nobleman, who desired to make use of his labours.</p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>University of Mountauban</hi> wanting a <hi>Professor of Philosophy,</hi> sent for <note place="margin">At <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban.</hi>
                  </note> him thither; where, according to the custom of the <hi>Academy,</hi> he taught and exercised his Scholars four hours every day, running over the whole body of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> whereby many of the Students took their degree with good approbation. While he was thus busily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Schools, all the rest of his spare time he spent in other Studies. He slept little, <note place="margin">Industry.</note> spending a great part of the night in the study of <hi>Divinity,</hi> which he propounded as his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest mark: for he alwaies purposed, if God should give him an opportunity to be a <hi>Pastor</hi> of a Church, and a <hi>Professor</hi> of an <hi>University.</hi> But when certain Students, his hearers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from <hi>Montauban</hi> into <hi>Xantoin,</hi> and <hi>Angouleme,</hi> and there, to his great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, divulged how eloquently he spake the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, affirming further, that he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself gravely and modestly, was of a most exemplary conversation, and that he had declared that he would embrace a call to the Ministry in the <hi>French</hi> Church, the Church of <hi>Verthole</hi> in <hi>Angouleme,</hi> having first advised with the <hi>Provincial Synod,</hi> cast their Eyes upon him, and sending delegates to <hi>Mountauban,</hi> they agreed with him that he should enter into the sacred Ministry, and undertake to be their <hi>Pastor:</hi> which he assented to, upon condition, that if he should have a call to any University, where he might exercise the Office both of a <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Professor,</hi> that Church should be willing to part with him. And thus after due examination and ttial he was ordained by the <hi>Synod,</hi> and setled in that Church.</p>
               <p>From thence he wrote often to Dr. <hi>Rivet,</hi> giving him an account of his Studies, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired a visit from him; being but a day or two journies off. Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> also informed the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Lord <hi>Du Plessis</hi> of his parts, and excellent indowments, at what time a <hi>Professors</hi> place was void, <hi>William Crag,</hi> a learned <hi>Scothman.</hi> who had long been a <hi>Professor</hi> of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> there, being now made a <hi>Professor</hi> of <hi>Divinity.</hi> When gone, <hi>Boíd</hi> came to him to <hi>Thoarse,</hi> Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> sent him with his letters of recommendation to <hi>Samur</hi> to the Lord <hi>Du Plessis,</hi> who having conferred with him in private, and heard him Preach in publick, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62667:27"/> counsels with the <hi>Synod,</hi> he brought it about that Delegates were sent to his Church at <hi>Verthole,</hi> requesting that for the good of the <hi>University,</hi> and by the approbation of the <hi>Provincial Synod,</hi> they'd give way to his dismission; for which end also they wrote Letters to the <hi>Synod.</hi> This request was very grievous to his Church, which highly prized him; yet looking at the benefit of the <hi>University,</hi> though very unwillingly, they at last dismissed him, with ample testimonies, both from the <hi>Synod</hi> and themselves.</p>
               <p>When he was come to <hi>Samur,</hi> he was admitted amongst the ordinary <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <note place="margin">At <hi>Samur</hi> a Pastor, and Professor.</note> Church, and besides, performed publick <hi>Lectures,</hi> and extraordinary <hi>Disputations</hi> in the <hi>University</hi> for some months, till a <hi>Synod</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Anjou, Coenoman</hi> and <hi>Tours,</hi> met together; whom the <hi>National Synod</hi> had appointed to provide fit <hi>Professors</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> in that <hi>University,</hi> and that they should carefully examine them, afore they admitted them. This was performed in <hi>Sept. An.</hi> 1608. at which time the <hi>Pastors</hi> of that Province met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to whom also were adjoined some <hi>Pastors</hi> of the neighbouring Provinces, among whom Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> was one. There divers <hi>Theological</hi> points about the Church, and Church-matters, were propounded to be disputed on, and <hi>Robert Boid,</hi> who was to undergo his Trial, was appointed to answer before the assembly of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Elders:</hi> which place he so discharged, that by the unanimous consent of all, he was judged worthy of that Chair; which for the space of 6 years after, <hi>viz.</hi> till the year 1614. he supplied with the great applause of all, and to the great profit of the Students, with unwearied labour, and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble industry and diligence. So that by his excessive watchings, he contracted a weakness of stomack: yet would he not (though intreated) favour himself, nor be prevail'd with to <note place="margin">His weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> forbear his ordinary Lectures, though he had time most freely allowed him for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his health.</p>
               <p>He alwaies observed this Rule, <hi>To fetch his Divinity from the fountains of the sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> for which end he made choice of the Epistle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> to expound it in his publick Lectures, because he saw that the Apostle had in this Epistle with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble succinctness comprized all the chief Heads of the Christian Religion, relating both to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> and omitted nothing that was necessary.</p>
               <p>In all his Disputations, which were many, he was solid and acute, and withal so clear, that he left no scruples remaining in the minds of his hearers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi.</hi> 1611. When that famous Assembly was held at <hi>Samur,</hi> in which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almost all the Protestant Nobility, and two <hi>Pastors</hi> delegated out of every <hi>Province,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boìd</hi> Preaching in his course among others, had this testimony from all, that so copious and <note place="margin">His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> eloquent language was admirable in a Foreigner, who had so lately learned their Tongue.</p>
               <p>And having a great care to improve his learning, and a desire to settle himself in <hi>France,</hi> he began to bethink himself of a fit Yoke-fellow, and finding an honest Virgin of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Malivern,</hi> he sought to her Parents for their consent, who having received a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory testimony out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of the Nobility of his birth, and competency of his Estate, they easily yeilded, and so he took her to Wife, with the great good liking both of the Church and <hi>University,</hi> who hoped, that by this means he would be fixed among them, so as never to entertain thoughts of returning to <hi>Scotland</hi> again, to settle there. <note place="margin">His Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But e're long things fell out otherwife; for King <hi>James</hi> taking care of the <hi>Universities</hi> within his Dominions, and hearing of Mr. <hi>Boid,</hi> what great credit he had at <hi>Samur,</hi> and being told by some noble <hi>Scotchmen,</hi> who were of kin to him, that he was most fit to be placed over the Colledge of <hi>Glascow,</hi> as one that was like to adorn the <hi>Divinity</hi> Chair there, they fo far prevailed that King <hi>James</hi> commanded him to return to his own Country; wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting also to the Lord <hi>Du Plessis,</hi> that with his and the <hi>Universities</hi> good leave he might come <note place="margin">His return to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> away. Thus his former purposes being overpowred, neither himself, nor they in <hi>France,</hi> to whom he was obliged, being able to resist, with much difficulty getting the consent of his Wife and her Parents, he bid Farewel to the <hi>University</hi> of <hi>Samur,</hi> who, sensible of their great loss, dismissed him with much grief.</p>
               <p>This removal from <hi>Samur</hi> to <hi>Glascow</hi> was <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1615. where for the first four years space all things went according to his own desire. His exemplary Holiness, singular Learning, admirable Eloquence; his Gravity, Humility, unaffected Modesty, extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diligence both in his <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Scholastical</hi> Employment, above the rate of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Professors,</hi> drew all to a Reverence, Love, and Esteem for, and many even to an admiration of, him. Under his conduct, with the assistance of his Colleagues, Mr. <note place="margin">His success there.</note>
                  <hi>William Blair,</hi> Mr. <hi>David Dickson,</hi> Mr. <hi>James Robertson,</hi> Mr. <hi>James Sharp,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Blair,</hi> the affairs of the <hi>University</hi> flourisht exceedingly. From the very beginning of the Reformation, the credit and concerns thereof, were in a very good posture, by the care, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62667:27"/> endeavours of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Smeton</hi> the <hi>Presidents</hi> there, who were famous for their dextrous management of all things relating both to Discipline, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and learning: but after the coming of Mr. <hi>Boid,</hi> every thing grew to a far greater heighth.</p>
               <p>His pains were unparallel'd, and indefatigable; for he sate daily at his studies, from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">His Indust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> till midnight, and sometime longer, saving only a few hours for the necessary resection of nature, and dispatch of the Exercises of his Place. For his Diet, he was very strict and severe: yet in his private conversation, when at any time he unbended himself thereto (for he was neither a man for all company, nor for any company at all seasons) he was most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly courteous, and among those with whom he was familiar, he was sometimes very pleasant and chearful, In all his publick <hi>Lectures,</hi> Piety, Learning and Eloquence strove <note place="margin">His rare Parts, and Practice.</note> which should get the Mastery. In the exercise of <hi>Discipline,</hi> whether in private <hi>Classes,</hi> or publick <hi>Assemblies,</hi> such was the severity of his Reproofs, the earnestness of his persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the authority of his Injunctions, the charity and prudence of his Counsels, and in all such a prevailing persuasiveness, that his looks and words were more powerful to reform what was amiss, than the sharpest corrections of others. And one Engine he had of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force than all the rest to work upon the most obstinate minds, and that was his solemn Prayers after the exercise of publick <hi>Discipline,</hi> and weekly censures, which he utter'd in <hi>Latine,</hi> with excellent and constant variety of composure, whereby he drew even rivers of tears from, and stir'd up troops of ardent desires in some of his hearers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Samur</hi> had abundant experience for six whole years together of his solidity in modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and determining in their Disputations, and <hi>Glascow</hi> had no less trial of his subtilty and profoundness in his <hi>extemporary Disputations</hi> in the solemn and frequent examination of Students: for, as for the <hi>Problematical</hi> sporting with Divinity, by young Men, so much used in most <hi>Universities,</hi> he thought it below the Majesty of that sacred Art: and therefore, though he were a most acute and skilful Master in the art of Disputing, and inferior to none, if not superior to most therein, yet he seem'd to have a peculiar conversation from it, and saw so many things which he thought fit to be reformed in your ordinary <hi>Divinity</hi> Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that he resolved wholly to forbear that exercise at <hi>Glascow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Conference and Discourse, though he condemn'd the practice of some in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> away their golden hours in frivilous chat, and impertinent prattle, yet if any one came to him either for satisfaction in any doubt, or for Counsel, or Comfort, or upon any such serious account, none did entertain them with greater humanity and humility, or more fully and freely open himfelf unto them.</p>
               <p>But above all, his peculiar Excellency did seem to lie in <hi>Practical Divinity,</hi> and resolving <note place="margin">Piety.</note>
                  <hi>Cases of Conscience;</hi> as appears not only by the whole contexture of his rare <hi>Comment</hi> on the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> but especially by that part of it on the 6th Chapter.</p>
               <p>His manner of performing his Lectures was this; Twice a week he read for an hour and a half together; but he did not read out of his Papers all that he delivered, as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of most is, but uttered all in a continued Discourse, without any hesitation, and with as much ease and freedom of speech as the most Eloquent Divine is wont to deliver his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Sermons in his Mother Tongue. One thing especially was admirable and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, that all his Quotations out of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, which were frequent, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very long, he repeated by heart, and never made use of any Notes in the Chair, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for an extraordinary long passage out of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> once or twice.</p>
               <p>We come now to the last part of his Life. For the four first years, after his coming to <note place="margin">Troubles begin.</note>
                  <hi>Glascow,</hi> all things ran smoothly, as was said; but afterwards the Clouds began to rise, and the Malice of the Devil did not suffer him to enjoy a much longer time of Peace. In the year 1618. as the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> met together, which proved very happy and successful to the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches; so there was held an <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Perth,</hi> which proved as fatal and mischievous to the <hi>British</hi> Churches. King <hi>James,</hi> otherwise a most wise Prince, was fatally mistaken in this, in that he suffered himself; to be influenc'd so far by the Counsels of A. Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and other Court-Bishops, as to resolve either by art, or force, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>Scottish</hi> Church to the <hi>English</hi> in point of Government and Ceremonies: And as a little before he had obtruded some Bishops out of <hi>England</hi> upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> Churches sore against their minds; so by means of that <hi>mock-counterfeit Synod</hi> at <hi>Perth,</hi> he appointed that five of the Chief <hi>English Ceremonies</hi> should be brought into use in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Hence came that train of quarrels, troubles and confusions, which overturned from the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, that flourishing Church. And though many, some out of one respect, some out of another, did submit their necks to this yoak; yet divers of the most Eminent Ministers, both for Piety and Learning, stood up in defence of the Liberty and Purity of the <hi>Scottish</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62667:28"/> Church, against the Innovation and Violent Attempts of the Bishops and Court-Party: And though Mr. <hi>Boid</hi> did not publickly intermeddle with these Controversies, yet he did not obsurely favour the Dissenters: But however, he extended his Charity to the Bishops, as hoping well of them, not being as yet thorowly acquainted with their Designs and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</p>
               <p>But as soon as the Bishops perceived that he did favour their Opposers, they lookt upon him with an evil Eye, and by their Emissaries did wrest all his deeds and words to the worst sense. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> the Head of the <hi>Anti-Episcopal</hi> Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> came frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a House of his, which was near <hi>Glascow;</hi> thither Mr. <hi>Boid</hi> went once or twice to make him a Visit, they being of Antient Acquaintance. This the Prelatical pick-thanks laid hold on, not only to spread abroad Rumors among the common people, but to write to the King also, That <hi>Trochreg</hi> was gone over into the Tents of the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> as they called them. Hereupon, that he might decline the King's displeasure, which he was afraid of, and the Bishops hatred, he entertained thoughts of leaving his publick Employment, and retiring himself to his own Estate which he had in <hi>Carick;</hi> from which yet he was earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissuaded by all his Friends; but all in vain; for he was fully resolved to lay aside both all his <hi>Academical</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Imployments, which accordingly he did sore against <note place="margin">He laid down his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> the mind of all those that were well-wishers to him, notwithstanding all they could say to the contrary: Which course yet he soon after repented of; for he considered that no man ought voluntarily to put himself out of that Station and Employment wherein God by his Providence has plac'd him, except he be by violence forc'd thereto; and therefore he earnestly desired that God would open a Door for his return again to some Employment either in the Church or University, that so his Talent that God had intrusted him with, <note place="margin">His trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> might again be brought forth to publick use for the honour of his Lord and Master.</p>
               <p>While he lived in this Privacy and Retirement, he kept correspondence with Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> (as he had done all along from their first Acquaintance) and communicated all his Affairs to him; and among other things, he acquainted him how that some who had been his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars, and pretended friends formerly, now discovered much Enmity against him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he wrote to them modestly and meekly, declaring his Judgment, and beseeching them by the bowels of <hi>Christ,</hi> to deal tenderly with their Brethren; and to use their best Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for procuring them liberty from that intollerable yoak which was imposed upon their consciences: This they took so heinously, and treated him so roughly afterwards, that he said he thought he might have found more favor from the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> with his four <hi>Assessors,</hi> than he did from them: He added, that according to the present posture of assairs, he saw little likelyhood of obtaining any further publick employment; though there was fire kindled in his Breast ready to break forth, when as he saw and heard those things which daily occur'd to his Eyes and Ears.</p>
               <p>While he was thus solicitous what to do, there came Messengers to him from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> desiring him to come to them, and undertake the charge of the <hi>Presidentship</hi> of the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> and of a <hi>Pastor</hi> of a Church, both which were then void. This wisht-for opportunity which thus unexpectedly offer'd it self, he readily embrac't, and came immediately to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> preparing himself to a diligent discharge of his undertaking. But the Devil fearing the ruine of his Kingdom by the singular accomplishments of this eminent Servant of God, laid a block in his way at his very entrance; for some of the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who were leaven'd with pride and error, fearing the presence of so holy and learned a man, wrote letters to <hi>Spotswood</hi> A. B. of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and to the <hi>English</hi> Court, whereby they obtain'd from King <hi>James</hi> Letters to the Magistrates of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> wherein he straitly charged them that they should by no means <hi>suffer</hi> Mr. <hi>Boid</hi> the use of either the <hi>Chair</hi> or the <hi>Pulpit</hi> in their City.</p>
               <p>This holy Man had resolved to discourse upon the Gospel of St. <hi>John</hi> in his Sermons to the People, but being thus stopt at the very beginning, he composed these Verses with a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful heart, which he wrote at the end of the first Sermon he had prepared on that Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>

               <p> Thus he was sent a second time to his uneasy privacy, where he lived a kind of banisht or imprison'd life; though by the diligent endeavours of his Friends he was almost recal'd again to <hi>Glascow.</hi> At length the charge of the Church at <hi>Paslet</hi> was committed to him: but here new storms arose: for the Widow of the Earl of <hi>Abercorn,</hi> Baron of <hi>Paslet,</hi> who was neat a kin to Mr. <hi>Boid,</hi> being lately turned <hi>Papist,</hi> stirred up her Children and Servants to give this Servant of God all the disturbance they could, and so to tire him out, and force him to leave the place; the Baron of <hi>Streban,</hi> a rash young man, complying too much with his Mothers advice, took the opportunity of Mr. <hi>Boid</hi>'s absence, his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and brake open the doors of his House, and in a tumultuous and reproachful manner, threw out all his Houshold stuff into the Streets: whereupon it was observed that that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily never did thrive afterwards, but were in a decaying condition, till they were reduced almost to nothing. Mr. <hi>Boid</hi> being almost overwhelmed with these troubles, withdrew from all publick imployment, and continued at his own House in <hi>Carict,</hi> until at length by his continual watching, grief, and excessive studies he contracted a swelling in his Throat: whereupon he went to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to consult some <hi>Physitians</hi> about it: but the distemper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing upon him, it put an end to his life.</p>
               <p>He died <hi>Jan.</hi> 5. 1627. in the 49th year of his age, in the midst of the sighs and <note place="margin">His Death.</note> tears of his dear and neer friends, who were witnesses of those divine joys and consolations wherewith his Soul was filled, even amidst the assaults of Satan, and those other trials that befel him.</p>

               <head>The Life and Death of Dr. <hi>Twiss,</hi> who dyed <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1644.</head>
               <p>DR. <hi>Twiss</hi> was an <hi>English</hi> Man, born of honest Parents, who yet lived but in a mean <note place="margin">His Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</note> condition. His Grandfather was a <hi>German,</hi> who upon some occasion came over into <hi>England,</hi> and by a gracious Providence of God he left this his Grandson, never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten among the Reverend Fathers of our English Church.</p>
               <p>When he was a Boy, he was brought up in the famous Shool of <hi>Winchester,</hi> where were <note place="margin">He went to <hi>Winchester</hi> School.</note> Bred also those eminently learned Men <hi>Bilson, Lake, Hanmer, Wotton, Hoskins</hi> (who was our <hi>Twisses Uncle)</hi> and he was familiarly acquainted with the other.</p>
               <p>When he was eighteen years old, he was sent to <hi>Wicham</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford;</hi> where he <note place="margin">Thence to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  </note> applied himself, first to the Study of <hi>Logick,</hi> than of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> in which Studies he continued in that University for about the space of twenty years.</p>
               <p>He was taken notice of in that University for his acute wit, his solid judgment, his integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <note place="margin">His excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Parts.</note>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62667:29"/> and pleasing behaviour, his pious, and humble mind, and at the last, he took his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Doctor, with a general applause. For he had before given a great manifestation both of his Learning, and Industry, in his Lectures, and Disputations; as also in transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, and judiciously correcting the Writings of that profound Doctor, <hi>Thomas de Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardine,</hi> which were to be Published by Sir <hi>Henry Savil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither was he less famous for his Sermons which he Preached in the University, though <note place="margin">An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</note> some were not so well pleased with them, saying, that his Gifts were fitter for the Schools than the Pulpit. But how powerful he was in his Ministry, may appear by this instance? There was in <hi>Oxford</hi> in his time one <hi>Joseph Barnet,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> both by Nation and Superstition, who read <hi>Hebrew</hi> to divers young Students, and had cunningly pretended, and held forth, that he embraced, and believed <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to be the true <hi>Messias:</hi> He professed that he was seriously and heartily grieved for his former Blasphemies against him. He mournfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed that the Eyes of his Brethren, and Countrymen were so blinded, and their hearts so hardened. He seemed to desire nothing more earnestly, than that he might be judged wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be admitted into the Christian Church by the Sacrament of <hi>Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By these tricks of Legerdemain he deceived many of the Learned Doctors, especially Dr. <hi>Lake,</hi> the worthy Provost of <hi>New Colledge,</hi> and afterwards B. B. of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells.</hi> And a <hi>Sabbath</hi> was appointed publickly, wherein Baptism should be administred to this new Disciple in the University Church of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> was commanded to Preach before the administration of this Sacred Ordinance, to add the more lustre to it. But the very day before he was to be Baptized, this dissembling <hi>Jew</hi> ran away. <note place="margin">Jewish Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocricy.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Lake</hi> being informed hereof, sent some on Horseback, others on foot to pursue him, who overtaking him, brought him back, though against his Will, to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where, on his own accord, he professed that he was returned to his old <hi>Judaism,</hi> which he had forsworn: he jeared at <hi>Christ,</hi> and despised <hi>Baptism:</hi> For he had now filled his Purse.</p>
               <p>Hereupon our <hi>Twiss</hi> laid aside the Sermon which he had prepared, and instead thereof Preached an excellent Sermon upon occasion of <hi>Barnets</hi> revolt, wherein he shewed Gods <note place="margin">His great Labours.</note> just Judgment upon that perverse Nation and People, whom he had given up to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate sense even to this very day. And this he performed with great applause, and to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the whole University: For that he had composed this in fewer hours, then the common Wits in the University could make a Sermon in so many weeks, yea months, and yet they consisted more in words then in profitable and useful matter.</p>
               <p>Hence it was that those <hi>Catechistical Lectures,</hi> which he read every <hi>Thursday</hi> in Term time in the Colledge Chappel, and those publick Sermons which he Preached every <hi>Lords Day</hi> throughout the year, in the Parish Church of <hi>Olives,</hi> were so much frequented by the Scholars, as well as by the Townsmen. And though he lay hid, as it were, in quiet in his <hi>Academical Cel,</hi> yet was his Name so celebrated in King <hi>James</hi> his Court, that that Prudent Prince made choice of him to be Chaplain to his only Daughter the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to wait upon her into the <hi>Palatinat</hi> to <hi>Heidleberg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> being now to leave his Native Country of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> before he went, he <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> disposed of his Patrimony (which was about 30 <hi>l. per annum)</hi> and commended it to his Brother, requiring him, that out of the Rents of it, he should raise Portions for his Sisters. And thus having disposed of his small Estate, he went cheerfully with the Princess into the <hi>Palatinat:</hi> And to deceive the tediousness of the journy, he faithfully expounded some part of Holy Scriptures daily, whereby he prevailed with his excellent Lady, to moderate her grief, for leaving her dear <hi>Brittain,</hi> being taught by him, <hi>That here we have no abiding City, but we seek for a better in the world to come.</hi> By these and such like admonitions, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this rare Princess her mind to encounter with the strongest gusts of adversity with an undaunted mind. And ttuly she was put upon great trials, when, after she was Crowned Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> she was forced not long after to fly out of that Country, being great with Child, and excluded out of the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> also (her Husbands Paternal Inheritance) and driven to live in exile all the remainder of her days, which sad dispensation of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, she bore with a masculine, and undaunted Spirit, being forewarned, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed by Dr. <hi>Twiss,</hi> whil'st he waited upon her, against such changes, and occurrences:</p>
               <p>For he had taught her, <hi>That Gods Divine Providence doth order all the Estates, and conditions of all Men, whether prosperous or adverse, according to his own good pleasure, and for the Eternal good of those that belong to him, according to that Promise.</hi> Rom. 8. 28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the Called according to his purpose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And probably upon this account it was that Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> one of the Sons of this Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Queen, in the time of our unhappy Civil War, coming unto <hi>Newberry,</hi> where
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62667:29"/> Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> was Minister, entertained him courteously, and used him familiarly, making large Promises to him, that he would be of the <hi>Antiparliamentarian</hi> side, and write in their defence, and live among them, but our Doctor neither could, nor was willing to live among Courtiers, especially when they were in Arms.</p>
               <p>Before Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> had continued two months in that honourable imployment in the Court of that Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> he was commanded back into <hi>England,</hi> not without the grief of that excellent Lady, and her Princely Husband, for the loss of such a Jewel, which the said Prince at the departure of Dr. <hi>Twiss,</hi> expressed, and professed in a <hi>Latine Oration</hi> which he made to him.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> being returned into <hi>England,</hi> did not betake himself to a Court Life; but <note place="margin">His return into <hi>Eng.</hi>
                  </note> wholly applied himself for the good of the Church, and in a Country Village fell more hard to his Scholastick Studies, and in a mean House, laid the foundation of those are works, which all the Reformed embraced, and admired.</p>
               <p>After some years he was sent for by the Magistrates of the Town of <hi>Newberry</hi> to be their Pastor, that where he had first seen the Light, he might be <hi>a burning and shining Light</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Goes to <hi>Newberry.</hi>
                  </note> to go before, and to guide and direct them in the way to Heaven: And there passed his time to the great content, and satisfaction of himself, and to the great profit and edification of the People.</p>
               <p>He was so far from seeking after Riches, and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Dignities and Preferments, that he modestly refused them when they were offered to him. Yea, he often pleased, and <note place="margin">Humility.</note> congratulated himself in his low, and mean condition, as being therein exposed to fewer Temptations: And he did often solemnly profess, that he was much indebted unto God, for that he had graciously placed him in a low, but far safer condition from such dangers as an <hi>Episcopal</hi> Dignity might have exposed him to.</p>
               <p>A great part of the Fellows of <hi>New Colledge</hi> in the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> (in whose power it was to chuse a <hi>Provost</hi> for the Government of the Colledge of <hi>Winchester)</hi> did earnestly request our Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> that he would be pleased to accept of that Place whereunto they had chosen him, and which was equal to the chiefest <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Preferment, at least for matter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: But he as earnestly contended against it, requesting them to confer and bestow it upon some other worthy Person: shewing hereby, that he rather desired to attend his Studies in private, then to wax old and idle in a more honourable Place. And which is more to be wondred at, his Wife, though she was the Daughter of one of the <hi>Prebends of Winchester,</hi> never repined, or was troubled at his refusing so fat, and plentiful a Place, and Estate. For this excellent Woman did seriously consider, that her <hi>Twiss</hi> should be nothing enriched thereby, but his Revenues would be spent upon others, and that her Husband would be occasioned to loose much time, which he esteemed most precious, and be impeded in his Studies, which he took so much pleasure in.</p>
               <p>Not many years after a <hi>Prebendary at Winchester</hi> was laid at his Feet, which he, with an humble superciliousness kicked from him. And this he did the rather, because he foresaw that it would breed a quarrel between Dr. <hi>Moor,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Neal;</hi> the one of them a B. B. and the other a <hi>Prebend</hi> of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and Father in Law to our <hi>Twiss.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Moor</hi> had Preached freely against B. <hi>Neal</hi> in a certain Church, and had been forced to give in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Parliament against him for his innovations, though against his will.</p>
               <p>The B. B. (by whose counsel it doth not appear) not long after, commanded Dr. <hi>Moor</hi> to Preach a Visitation Sermon before the Clergy at <hi>Winchester.</hi> After the Sermon, the B. B. complained that he had often been unworthily abused by Dr. <hi>Moor,</hi> and he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to carry away a most Christian Victory over him. For now, having better knowledge of him, he would put him into the Catalogue of his chiefest Friends; and that there should be nothing which <hi>Moor</hi> should not be ashamed to ask, which he would not glory in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Dr. <hi>Moor</hi> returned great thanks to the B. B. And only begged of him, that himself being now worn out with Age, and labours, he would be pleased to bestow his Prebendship upon one of his Sons in Law, either Dr. <hi>Twiss,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Metkerk,</hi> Dr. of Divinity, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Professor of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue in the University of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The B. B. readily granted this request, and designed Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> for to be the Prebend: But he, returning his humble and hearty thanks both to the B. B. and to his Father in-Law, intreated them to give him leave to abide in <hi>Newberry</hi> to attend that Flock over which God had set him: judging himself unfit for a Cathedral employment, and saying, that it was hard for him, among such eminent Men, as were the <hi>Prebends</hi> of <hi>Winchester,</hi> either to sing <hi>Musically</hi> enough, or to Preach <hi>Rhetorically</hi> enough to their liking.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Right Honourable, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> designed him to a better <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> Rectory, but a smaller Parish than <hi>Newberry</hi> was; Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> (considering that old Age
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62667:30"/> was now creeping on, and his Strength was not like to hold out long) thankfully accepted <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> of it, provided that he would take care that his People of <hi>Newberry</hi> might be furnished with a godly and faithful Pastor at his leaving of them. Himself also went to the A. B. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with whom he had been familiarly acquainted while they had been Students in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and requested his favour therein: The Archbishop entertained him courteously and promised to grant all that he requested, adding that he would represent him to the King for a pious and learned man, and no Puritane: Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> being of a quick and sagacious Wit, perceived that Snares were laid to entrap him; and therefore without applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self any more to the Bishop he returned to his former place at <hi>Newberry,</hi> and entertained no more thoughts of leaving it, and there he spent his time in Reading, Meditating, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Piety.</note> and Writing, to his great Content and Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Surely many of the venerable Cathedral Doctors never preached so many Sermons as our Dr. published Books, and some never read so many Books as he composed: For besides what he Printed, he left about Thirty compleated behind him. The reason was, because he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created his mind, not with playing at Cards as too many do, but with writing Books.</p>
               <p>His Recreations were friendly to debate with, and confute the Enemies of <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and of the <hi>Churches Peace.</hi> And his abilities always encreased with his work; and by how much difficult the questions were, by so much more they were pleasing to him: But of all his Adversaries none put him to greater trouble then Dr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> whose sense and meaning he could hardlier find out than confute his Errours: neither could he so easily overthrow his Arguments as he could those of <hi>Arminius, Corvinus,</hi> yea, and of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> themselves, all things in him being hidden in such dark Expressions, and deep ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity.</p>
               <p>After he had overcome and beaten down this <hi>veterane Enemy,</hi> who was a man of a greater <note place="margin">His Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> and no less Industry, (yet who spent most of his time and labour in making clear things doubtful and obscure.) After <hi>Jackson</hi> there arose one <hi>Hord,</hi> a young Scholar (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,) but in truth this <hi>Hord</hi> was one <hi>Mason,</hi> a man of about Sixty years old, who in his young days had been well acquainted in the University both with our <hi>Twiss</hi> and <hi>Jackson,</hi> him also our Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> encountred, whom he did not only weary, but wholly overthrew him.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Mason</hi> there arose one <hi>Thomas Godwin,</hi> a very learned man, both in the antiquities of the <hi>Hebrews, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> but indeed fitter to instruct <hi>Grammarians,</hi> than to deal with <hi>Logicians,</hi> and who had more power as Master of the School in <hi>Abingdon,</hi> than as Dr. of Divinity: And our Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> quickly whipt this old Schoolmaster, and that <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula</hi> which he had used with Pride enough, he wrested it out of his hand, and exposed him to be derided by Boys.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Thomas</hi> one <hi>John Godwin,</hi> the Minister in St. <hi>Stephens Coleman-street, London,</hi> came upon the Stage, whom Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> encountred with, and condemned his Book of <hi>Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and easily discovered that that vainglorious Divine did but sell to his Disciples pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous trifles, and guilded Coals to be adored by them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, our Dr. did not abstain from dealing with Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> though his dear Friend, and an eminent Minister, about the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> (about which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> did somwhat err) with him he dealt gently: And because he knew that the very name of <hi>Cotton</hi> was more prevalent with the Godly, though otherwise weak, than other mens Arguments, he dealt very candidly and gently with him, as he also did with <hi>Piscator du Moulin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> all which he reverenced as his Fathers, at leastwise he loved them as his Brethren, and dealt with them accordingly, whilest he examined their Opinions, which he judged less sound. But in defending the cause of God and of his Grace, he feared not to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with any man living.</p>
               <p>Neither did he less strenuously contend for the <hi>Morallity of the Sabbath,</hi> and among others he handled Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> according to his desert, whom never any other man meddled with with impunity.</p>
               <p>About this there came forth a Proclamation, wherein the People were allowed to use some sports which they called <hi>Innocent,</hi> and all Ministers were commanded to read the same in their Churches, upon the pain of Suspension both from Office and Benefice. Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> refused to read it, yea, he modestly declared against it; diverse other Ministers did the like, for which that severe Penalty was inflicted upon them: But Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> scaped better: for King <hi>James</hi> being informed of his refusal, secretly commanded the Bishops that they should not presume to meddle with him.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the King knew very well, that though Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> had but a small Estate, and lived meanly at home, yet his Fame was great abroad in all the Reformed Churches,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62667:30"/> and that the Bishops could decree nothing hardly against him, but it would redound great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their own disgrace. And truly it was no small disparagement to them that they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered so eminently learned a man as Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> to live without Preferment, who was so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous abroad, and yet at home a poor Curate in an obscure Village. And Reverend Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> upon an occasion, said, The Bishops did little consult their own Credit, for that they had not preferred Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> (though against his Will) to some splendid <hi>Ecclesiastical Dignity,</hi> by which (though they dispaired to draw him to their Party, yet) they might at least have taken off, or mollified the popular Envy, and not have heard themselves to be exposed to scorn by the Curate of <hi>Newberry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1643. In the beginning of the year the Parliament designing to Reform <hi>Ecclesiastical Affairs,</hi> called an Assembly of learned Divines to advise and assist them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and when they were met together with an unanimous consent, they chose Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> to be the <hi>Prolocutor:</hi> But he, according to his usual Modesty, often refused it, yet was it in vain; for he was placed in the Chair: But after some Months being broken with labour <note place="margin">Prolocutor;</note> and Age, he fell dead in the very Pulpit.</p>
               <p>For indeed he had long born with much grief the Discord and Divisions between the King <note place="margin">His Death.</note> and Parliament, which he foresaw would prove Fatal to both Parties: And he often wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heartly that that Fire might be quenched, though with his Blood.</p>
               <p>Neither was it a less Affliction to him to see the Contentions; whilest some would have nothing Reformed, others would have all things changed, and turned uplide down. And this added not a little to his grief, to see whither the evil Counsels of some that were not evil men tended; who under a pretence of purging the Church, would expose her to spoil and Rapine: For he feared that if the Church were robbed of her Patrimony, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion also would be destroyed: And though himself had learned to live chearfully on a small Estate, yet he feared lest many of his Brethren in the Ministry, if they should be brought to the like straits, whilest they were solicitous about their worldly Affairs, would neglect their care of the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>And hence first it was that his thoughts were greatly disturbed, and his disturbed thoughts impaired his Health, and his Health being impaired, and his Private Studies and publick Employments not lessened, whilest he spake unto God in the name of the People, and to the People in the name of God, and raised up the hearts of his Hearers into Heaven, he fell down even in the very Pulpit: For his mind, whilest he was too much busied in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Affairs, his weak Body was not able to bear up under it; for though his Constitution was naturally good, and he was of a chearful Disposition, yet Age had now made it heavy and somwhat burdensome.</p>
               <p>Being carried out of the Church to his Lodging, and laid upon his Bed, there resorted unto him men of all sorts, who regarded either Religion or Learning, to whom for about a year together he gave notable Evidences of his Faith, and was a rare Example of Patience, at the end whereof God translated him from his narrow Lodging to a spatious and blessed Pallace in the Kingdom of Heaven: He seriously used these words, (which were almost his last,) <hi>Now at length I shall have leisure to follow my Studies to all Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole <hi>House of Commons</hi> in a certain sad and sorrowful Pomp, followed him to his Funeral. Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> preached his Funeral Sermon most eloquently upon that Text, <hi>Jos.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Moses my Servant is dead.</hi> He was buried in <hi>Westminster-Abby,</hi> not far from King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th's Chappel, where the Kings and Peers use to be buried. He needed neither <hi>Trophies, Marbles,</hi> nor <hi>Epitaphs.</hi> He provided Monuments for himself by every Volume which he wrote, which will be more durable than either Brass or Marble.</p>
               <p>The day after the Parliament voted a Thousand Pound to be given to his Children out of the publick Treasury, but they never received any part of it, being cheated both of that; and of what else their Father left them, by some crafty Knaves: Yet it pleased God by his good Providence, so to provide for them, that they lived comfortably, and so as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <note place="margin">Providence special.</note> the Children of so great and eminent a Man.</p>
               <p>Yet this excellent man was but a man, as himself oft confessed, and therefore thought nothing that was humane strange unto him. He had his infirmities, whereof the most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible was this: That he was of a facile Nature, and too prone to be deceived by giving too much credit to those, whom, by Information from others, or in his own Opinion, he judged to be godly. Whence it came to pass that he was often imposed upon, especially by certain crafty Heads, who solemnly professed that their chiefest care was the preservation of the purity of Doctrine, and reformation of Discipline, whereas indeed and truth they sought the utter Subversion of both. Whilest he hearkened to these Dissemblers, who yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that they studied nothing more than a purer Reformation, and gave too casie cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62667:31"/> to them, and became a Patron to them, he failed too much, and afterwards he was more troubled at it, because it was too late to help it.</p>
               <p>Good God! How seriously, though too late, did he bewail the sad lot of the Church, which he foresaw to be in danger of Ruine in the very Reformation? How greatly did he grieve that the Reins were let loose to <hi>Heresies,</hi> whereas he presumed they would have been straitned? How grievously did he sigh for that cursed Liberty granted unto <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> whereas he thought that all their audaciousness would have been repressed? How heartily did he grieve to see the woful confusions both in Church and State, whenas he hoped that all in both should have been reduced into better order? How holily was he displeased that too much Liberty was indulged to the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Fooleries, when he had believed that they should have been deservedly hissed out of the Church? How grievously did he bear the neglect, and suspitions, raised against Godly and Orthodox Teachers, when he looked that they should have been more honoured and esteemed?</p>
               <p>He solemnly professed his Fears, that if he had been advanced to the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Chair, he should have been insnared with the excesses of unworthy Bishops. And he gave hearty thanks to God, who had kept him, through his meer Grace, from such Honours, and Prelatical Temptations as he might have been exposed to. And in nothing it more appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what excellent Graces God had adorned Dr. <hi>Twiss,</hi> than by his frequent Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pravity of his Nature, which now he was astonished at. And out of his great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, he was still admiring the Gifts and Graces of God in others, and highly prizing and commending them, though they were far inferiour to his own. He reverenced and esteemed all good men, and only thought meanly of himself.</p>
               <p>He constantly kept a Monthly Fast in his own Family, whereby he endeavoured to quicken his Prayers, by which with great importunity he sought unto God in the behalf of the afflicted Church of Christ, that God would be gracious unto it, and restore it to Peace in his own due time. Every day he applied himself with great Zeal and Fervency of Spirit to the Throne of Gods Grace by Prayer, and always before Dinner and Supper he read a Portion of the sacred Scriptures, expounding the more obscure and difficult pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages therein, for the Edification of his Family. And out of these Scriptures he prudently gathered Arguments, whereby he might the more abase himself and his, and with the greater importunity wrestle with God, for the obtaining of such mercies as he craved of him.</p>
               <p>He was once sent for by the States of <hi>Frizland</hi> to be a Professor among them, which, in an Epistle that he wrote to them, he acknowledged with great Thankfulness; but prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Country Obscurity before the splendor of the University, which he also did when he was proferred the chief Professors place in <hi>Oxford.</hi> He never got any thing by the Books which he Printed, besides the applause of the Orthodox, and the Envy of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators. His Pen was a Hammer to beat down the <hi>New Pelagians,</hi> as Truth was his Buckler. He dyed about the Year 1644.</p>

               <head>The Life and Death of Mr. <hi>Thomas Wilson,</hi> who dyed <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1651.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Wilson</hi> was born at <hi>Catterlen,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cumberland, Anno Christi,</hi> 1601. His Parents were Sober, Honest Persons: His Father had a competent Estate, and was of the best sort of <hi>Yeomen</hi> in those Parts. When our <hi>Thomas</hi> was <note place="margin">His Birth, Parentage, Education, Prosiciency,</note> fit for it, he was sent to School to <hi>Blentow</hi> in the aforesaid County, where, under the care of Mr. <hi>Wilkinson,</hi> his Schoolmaster, he profited even beyond expectation, and far excelled all his Contemporaries. And he was observed in his Youth to have a sharp wit, a firm me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and to be indefatigable at his Book, which occasioned his Friends to hope that in time, he would prove (as afterwards he did) an Instrument of doing much good.</p>
               <p>His great Proficiency at School, encouraged his Father (when he was fit for it) to send him to the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he was admitted into <hi>Christs Colledge,</hi> when he <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                  </note> was about seventeen years old; in which place he spent not his time, as too many others did
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62667:31"/> in evil or idle courses, but devoted himself wholly to his Studies, insomuch as he was taken notice of, both by the Master and Fellows of the Colledge, for his great diligence and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousness: It might have been written over his Study Door, <hi>Nulla Dies sine Linea:</hi> No Day passed over his Head without some progress in his Learning: But though he did spend <note place="margin">His Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</note> most of his time in <hi>Academical</hi> Learning (his acuteness, in which did appear above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after he had left the University) yet did he not this while neglect the Study of <hi>Divinity</hi> but in order to his serving the Lord, and his Church in the work of the Ministry (if God should see it fit) he read both <hi>Positive,</hi> and <hi>Polemical</hi> Authors: But of all Books none was so esteemed, or read so much by him as the <hi>Holy Bible.</hi> So that it may be said of him as the Holy Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith of <hi>Timothy, From a Child he knew the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make us Wise to Salvation.</hi> Himself told an intimate Friend, that before <note place="margin">Scriptures studied.</note> he was <hi>Batchelor</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> he had read the whole Bible, with the Annotations of <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> three times over.</p>
               <p>Some time after he had taken his Degree of <hi>Batchelor</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> he was removed from the University upon this occasion. Mr. <hi>John Bristow,</hi> a Reverend Minister, and Pastor of <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swod</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> wrote to Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> of <hi>Christs Colledge</hi> (that eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for Learning, who was his Tutor) to send him an able and Religious Scholar, to teach <note place="margin">He leaves the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</note> School in his House, Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> soon pitched his thoughts upon his Pupil, Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> not knowing how hetter to fit and gratify Mr. <hi>Bristow,</hi> and glad he was that he could answer his request so well.</p>
               <p>At Mr. <hi>Bristow</hi>'s he continued about four years, instructing the Youths committed to his charge with great diligence, and faithfulness: He made conscience of improving his time, and trust reposed in him, and gave his Scholars more cause to bless God for their education <note place="margin">His Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</note> under him, then <hi>Secrates</hi> had for being brought up under such a Master as was <hi>Plato.</hi> He hath professed that he knew no calling, except that of the Ministry, wherein a Man might be more servicable to God and his Church, than that of teaching Youth, It is noted by some that one chief cause of <hi>Julians</hi> Apostacy and profaness was, that he was bred under two <hi>Heathenish</hi> Tutors, <hi>Libanius</hi> and <hi>Iamblicus:</hi> But it was the happiness of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Chawswood</hi> that they had their Sons brought up by one who had both a dexterity, and fidelity, to instruct them both in Humane and Divine Learning.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bristow</hi> observing Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi>'s fitness, and Ability for a greater and higher em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment than that of instructing Children, and taking notice that his Heart was set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the work of the Ministry, (to prepare himself for which, he made use of all his vacant hours from the School,) he judged it not convenient to deprive the Church any longer of so able and worthy a Labourer, and therefore though it was a considerable loss to himself and the Parish, to loose so good a man, yet he preferred the publick good of the Church before his private, and advised Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> wholly to betake himself to Preaching.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Candlestick</hi> wherein this <hi>Light</hi> was set, was <hi>Capel</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <note place="margin">He enters upon the Ministry.</note> for some time, directing his People by his holy Example, and judicious, diligent Preaching the way to Eternal Life. And though the Parish gave him little or nothing for his pains, yet was he never the less faithful and laborious for the welfare of their Souls: For he <hi>sought not theirs but them;</hi> not their Temporal Goods, but the Spiritual and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <note place="margin">His Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness therein.</note> Welfare of their immortal Souls. Here he had the Love and Esteem of all godly People, both Ministers and private Christians, round about; and indeed by his holy, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and humble Conversation he was such a <hi>Loadstone</hi> as wherever he came, he drew the Hearts of all sober Christians after him: What <hi>Nazianzen</hi> said of <hi>Athanasius</hi> may be truly said of him, that he was <hi>Magnes &amp; Adamas;</hi> A Loadstone in his sweet, gentle Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet an Adament in his stout and resolute courage against all Errours and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness.</p>
               <p>His continuance at <hi>Capel</hi> was not long, but upon some Reasons, by the means of the aforesaid Mr. <hi>Bristow,</hi> he was removed to <hi>Farlington</hi> (near unto <hi>Portsmouth</hi> in <hi>Hampshire)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move.</note> an ignorant, heathenish People, whom he endeavoured (so long as he staid among them) to Instruct and Reform. Though there was little of Religion amongst his Parishoners, nor scarce any savour of Good, yet whilst he abode there, the Church was much frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (Christians flocking in to hear him for diverse Miles round about) and when he was called thence, his loss was much bewailed by them.</p>
               <p>He staid not long in <hi>Hampshire;</hi> and sure he had very good grounds for his frequent Removals, and afterwards it appeared that God intended so able and useful an Instrument <note place="margin">His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move.</note> for more publick and General Service, not thinking good to confine such great Gifts and Graces to such small Parishes.</p>
               <p>His next Removal was to <hi>Tedington</hi> near to <hi>Kingston upon Thames,</hi> in which place he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62667:32"/> continued some Years, and (through the Blessing of God) his Ministry had great success, and much acceptance among such as feared God, during his abode at <hi>Tedington,</hi> he (being then about Twenty six Years old) had a desire to visit his Native Country, where his friends and Relations lived: And it pleased God so to assist him in his Labours among them, that in this journey he became profitable to the conversion of many Souls unto God. While <note place="margin">He visits his Country.</note> he was in <hi>Cumbarland</hi> he was requested to preach in <hi>Penroth,</hi> a great (if not the greatest) Market Town in the County, where, time out of mind, there had been a considerable Market of all sorts of Food kept every <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> till Nine a Clock in the Morning. But after he had preached two or three Sermons, he prevailed so far with the Ministers and chief of the Town, that it was proclaimed the <hi>Tuesday</hi> following, (which was on their <note place="margin">Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Weekly Market-day,) That no Person, for the time to come, should bring any Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als or Ware whatsoever, to be sold on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> but that <hi>Saturday</hi> should be the time for the sale of those Commodities. And for many years after the People did forbear to sell or buy any thing in the Town upon the <hi>Sabbath-day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next Removal was from <hi>Tedington</hi> to <hi>Otham,</hi> within two or three Miles of <hi>Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> the occasion whereof was this: There were many serious, understanding <note place="margin">His Remove into <hi>Kent.</hi>
                  </note> Christians in <hi>Maidston,</hi> who were much troubled and dejected for the dulness and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Ministry under which they lived. The Children craved <hi>Bread,</hi> and their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Fathers (by Profession and Office) fed them with <hi>Stones,</hi> so that their Souls were ready to famish for want of Food: Hereupon Mr. <hi>Robert Swinnoch,</hi> an active godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and one of the <hi>Aldermen</hi> or <hi>Jurats</hi> of the Town, procured the <hi>Presentation</hi> of <hi>Otham</hi> upon the Death of the <hi>Incumbent:</hi> After which he consulted with his Friends and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Neighbours, how he might procure an able Minister for that place, herein aiming, not only at the Good and Benefit of that Parish, but of the Christians also of <hi>Maidston,</hi> who, with a little trouble and Travel, might reap the fruit of his Labours at <hi>Otham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In pursuance of this Design, some of them repaired to <hi>London,</hi> where (by Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) they heard of Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> to whom they presently took their Journey, and heard him Preach at <hi>Darking</hi> in <hi>Surry</hi> to their great satisfaction, After Sermon they acquainted him with the cause of their coming, and the sad condtion of the godly People in those parts where they lived, and requested him to accept of the <hi>Presentation</hi> of <hi>Otham.</hi> He who was never hasty and rash, especially in such matters of Weight and Concernment, asked the judgment of his Neighbour Ministers in the Country, and some in the City of <hi>London,</hi> who, after deliberation, did agree and concur in this, That in regard of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of those that feared God, in and about <hi>Maidston,</hi> and the great opportunities that he might now enjoy there, of doing good to many Souls, he ought to embrace this Call. And accordingly upon the Declaration of their Opinion, he was presented to <hi>Otham,</hi> where <note place="margin">His great success.</note> the Lord was pleased wonderfully to bless and prosper his Ministry, for the Conversion and Building up of many of his Hearers.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> was a man that <hi>divided the Truth of God aright: A work-man that needed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note>
                  <hi>not to be ashamed:</hi> A <hi>Boanerges:</hi> A Son of Thunder in preaching the Law, to awaken se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, sensless Sinners, so that his Hearers might say of him, as one of the Antients said of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, <hi>Non tam Verba quam Tonitrua audiebant:</hi> That they heard not so much Words as Thunderclaps, when they heard him open the dreadful Curses of the Law, and the terrible Wrath of God against Sin and Sinners. Many an one hath come to him as the Gaoler did to the Apostles, <hi>trembling,</hi> and crying out, <hi>Sir, what shall I do to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> To such he was a <hi>Barnabas;</hi> A Son of sweet Consolation, and could so display that exceeding Riches of Divine Grace in the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as to attract and draw their Hearts to a ready and chearful compliance with, and a hearty acceptation of it. He, as a faithful Steward, gave to every one his <hi>own Portion:</hi> Terrour to whom Terrour belonged, and Comfort to whom Comfort, whereby (the Holy Ghost setting in with the Word) a numerous Issue of New-born Children were begotten, and brought forth to Christ. Here he preached, according to the Apostles Command, <hi>in season and out of season;</hi> Not only <note place="margin">His Indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigableness.</note> twice every <hi>Lords-day,</hi> but also every <hi>Holy-day,</hi> and at diverse Funerals, yea, though the Person interred were so poor that nothing could be expected for his pains.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was Minister at <hi>Otham,</hi> many from <hi>Maidston,</hi> and Seven or Eight Miles round about, did ordinarily repair to his Ministry, and joined in Communion with him at the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> But the number of those that flockt to him was so great, that his Church could not contain them, which was a great Eye-sore to the prophane World, and caused several Ministers about him to envy and much to malign him. <note place="margin">Envy.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Before his coming, there was an evil custom at <hi>Otham,</hi> for the <hi>Fulling Mills</hi> thereabouts <note place="margin">Sabbath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> to work every <hi>Lords-day;</hi> but he convinced the Owners so throughly of the Unlawfness
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62667:32"/> thereof, that they presently gave over, and suffered their Mills to stand still on those days for many years after he left them.</p>
               <p>But the only wise God who governeth the World, saw sit for some time, and for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons best known to himself, to lay aside this very useful Person: For he had not been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years at <hi>Otham</hi> when the Book for <hi>Sports on the Lords-days</hi> came forth, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto him that he should publickly read it on the next <hi>Lords-day</hi> in his Church, <note place="margin">He is sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</note> which he refusing to do (whereof he gave divers Reasons) was suspended <hi>ab Officio &amp; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficio.</hi> Upon his <hi>Suspension</hi> his Cure was committed to such Ministers as he could not with comfort own, nor join with, whereupon he removed his Habitation to <hi>Maidston,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Removes to <hi>Maidston▪</hi>
                  </note> and he was a great help in private to the Christians there, whilst his <hi>Suspension</hi> continued, and from them he received some supplies towards the maintenance of himself and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>Whilest he continued at <hi>Maidston</hi> he was still sollicitous for the good of his People at <hi>Otham,</hi> and therefore to encourage them to unite among themselves, and to a Gospel Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; as also to convince his Adversaries, who had causlesly traduced him to be a Favourer and an Abettor of <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions,</hi> he wrote a Letter to his Parishioners, wherein <note place="margin">His Letter to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> he exhorted them to fear the Lord and honour the King, and to walk in Love each to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And not to nourish in themselves a dislike of Government, or Contempt of those whom God had set over them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Letter was publickly read on a <hi>Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> to his Congregation, by one Dr. <hi>Tuck,</hi> which he did that so all his Congregation might know his judgment, and the advice which he thought necessary to give them; yet was it done without the Appointment of Mr. <hi>Wilson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The News of this Letter, and the publick Reading of it was quickly carried to <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">New trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> where it gave such distaste to some, that both Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> and the Dr. were cited to appear in the <hi>High-Commission Court,</hi> and to answer for what they had done. Both of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared several times to their great trouble and cost, and notwithstanding all they did, and could alleadg in their own Defence, yet were they enforced to continue their Attendance upon the Court for the space of three Years: In this case Dr. <hi>Tucks</hi> trouble was far the greater, because (his Body being unable to bear riding) he was necessitated to make these long Journeys of Thirty Miles at a time on Foot.</p>
               <p>During Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi>'s Suspension, a Neighbour Minister being greedy of his Living, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a Suit against him, to eject him wholly out of <hi>Otham;</hi> but his Patron [Mr. <hi>Swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch]</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malice.</note> made good his Title, and so the malicious design of his Adversary was prevented.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Suspension</hi> continued to the Year 1639. about which time the <hi>Scots</hi> entred into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> a Parliament was called, and then Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi> took off his <hi>Suspension.</hi> But his Troubles and Sufferings were not yet at an end: For <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1640. <hi>Septemb.</hi> 30th, he, and other Ministers, were cited to appear at a Visitation of the Archbishops at <hi>Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> to answer for their not reading the Prayer which was made against the <hi>Scots,</hi> as also to take a new devised Oath, commonly called, <hi>The &amp;c. Oath.</hi> But when he, and <note place="margin">New trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> his Brethren presented themselves at the place and time appointed, they understood that the Oath should be wholly waved, and the only Question should be, Why they did not read the aforementioned Prayer? Upon this they consulted together, whether it were best for them to appear before the Archbishops Vicar General or no: It was alledged by some, that the Parliament (which they apprehended would be some Relief to them) was to meet <hi>November</hi> the third following, and therefore they judged it prudential to hold off for the present; and in case they should afterwards be cited to appear at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that they should only appear by a <hi>Procter,</hi> and so protract time so much as might, to see what the Parliament would do in this case.</p>
               <p>But upon a serious weighing the Arguments on both sides, it was concluded that they should appear, and leave the success to God, however he should please to dispose of them. Hereupon Mr. <hi>Edward Bright</hi> of <hi>Gondhurst,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> immediately repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Inn, where Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> [the Vicar General] with the Archdeacon, and some inferiour Officers sat. They no sooner appeared, but Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> was pointed out by one present to the <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> who thereupon asked him his Name, and whether he had read the Prayer against the <hi>Scots</hi> or no. Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> answered <hi>No.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon</hi> presently suspended him <hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio,</hi> without admonishing, or giving him any time to consider of it, which rash Act was deemed, even by the Favourites of that Court, to be neither <hi>Prudential</hi> nor <hi>Canonical.</hi> Though Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> stood by, and saw <note place="margin">His Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> such harsh dealing against his Brother, and perceived the Service much hotter than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, yet did he not fly from his Colours, no, nor so much as make a Retreat; but being called, answered to his Name, and being asked whether he had read the Prayer, he gave a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62667:33"/> negative Answer, adding this Reason, because in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> it is enjoined, that no Prayer should be publickly read, except those that were in the Book <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> as this Prayer against the <hi>Scots</hi> was not.</p>
               <p>This unexpected Answer so puzzled the <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> (who was not the readiest or acutest to make a Reply) as caused him to have Recourse to Sr. <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> for Advice, who, upon Information of Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi>'s Reasons, very ingenuously left the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to do as he should see cause, refusing to meddle therein. Upon this the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> (the edge of his Fury being somwhat abated) proceeded more deliberately with Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> than he had done with Mr. <hi>Bright,</hi> and gave him fourteen days time to consider of it, and then to give in his answer at <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithstanding this intermission, the Archbishop had not yet done with Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> For in <hi>March</hi> following he was again prosecuted by him. Upon a <hi>Holiday</hi> in that <note place="margin">New trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> Month Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> Preacht in publick, and after Sermon he, with some other Friends, met at the Parsonage House, whereof one Mr. <hi>Butcher</hi> (a man eminent for Piety) had a part, to repeat the Sermon and to pray. After these Duties were ended, in a room, which was peculiar to Mr. <hi>Butcher,</hi> one knockt at the Door, to which Mrs. <hi>Wilson</hi> was about to go, but suddenly started back, fearing that it might be a <hi>Messenger</hi> sent to apprehend her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: But the Messenger immediately came into the Room where Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> and his Friends were, and putting off his Hat, enquired which was Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> pretending that he had some private business with him. And though Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> was there in his Gown, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving newly Preached and Prayed, and thereby was easily to be distinguished from all the rest, yet God so ordered it by his good Providence, that the Messenger observed him not. <note place="margin">A special Providence</note>
               </p>
               <p>Presently after the Messenger came in, Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> stepped behind some of his Friends, and Mr. <hi>Butcher</hi> wisely stepped forward, and told the <hi>Messenger</hi> that the Room wherein they were was his, and bad him look for Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> in his own Rooms. Upon this the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger</hi> withdrew into the Hall, and in the <hi>interim</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> went up the Stairs into his Study, where he concealed himself until Night, and then escaped to the House of one Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> in the Park of <hi>Maidston.</hi> The <hi>Pursivant</hi> looking about in vain, went again into the Parlor, and missing one whom he had seen there before, charged upon all there present that they had conveyed away Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> and told them that they must find him out. He produced also his Warrant, under the Hands of many of the Privy Council, of whom the Archbishop, and the B. B. of <hi>London</hi> were two, requiring him to attach the Body of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Wilson,</hi> Rector of <hi>Otham,</hi> and bring him before them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pursivant</hi> having shewed them his Warrant, required and commanded Mr. <hi>Butcher</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Morgsan</hi> to assist him in searching the House for Mr. <hi>Wilson;</hi> but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his diligent search, he missed his Prey: For Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> could not be found. The <hi>Messenger</hi> was very angry that he should see, and yet thus loose him. But when, in some threatnings to the Persons present, he had vented his Choller, he grew somwhat cooler, and after some private Discourse with Mrs. <hi>Wilson,</hi> he took his leave, saying, that he had been a <hi>Messenger</hi> to the Council-Table Thirty six Years, and was never served so before. For he confessed that he heard him Preach that day in publick, and yet when he saw him so soon after, and that in his Gown, yet he did not know him. But God (who in the like sort hid <hi>Athanasius)</hi> had a Hand in it, <hi>Whose Kingdom rules over all,</hi> Psal. (103. 19.) He hath sundry strange ways for the Preservation of his People.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Circumcellians</hi> laid an Ambush in the way where they knew St. <hi>Augustine</hi> was to go, <note place="margin">Strange Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</note> but by a good Providence of God, his Guide, missing his way, led him about another way, whereby he escaped their Hands. In Qu. <hi>Maries</hi> days, <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> B. B. of <hi>Winchester,</hi> sent after Mr. <hi>John Fox,</hi> who afterwards writ the <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> as far as <hi>Ipswich</hi> to apprehend him: The Barque in which he was was newly gone out of the Haven when the Messenger came to take him; the next day, by reason of Storms, he was driven back into the same place again; but before his Return, the Messenger (despairing to meet with him) was departed. And since those days Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> (a very learned and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man) was prosecuted by Archbishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> for his Book against the <hi>Cross,</hi> &amp;c. On a time the Archbishop having Intelligence that Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> was in a certain Citizens House in <hi>London,</hi> thinking that now he was sure of him, sent one presently to watch at the Door of the House, to see that none should stir out, till others came with a <hi>Warrant</hi> to search it for Mr. <hi>Parker.</hi> The Person sent, sat him down at the Door, boasting that none should come forth but he would know what and who they were.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> and his Friends within, were much troubled what to do, and how Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> might be secured: At last it was resolved that he should attire himself like a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and so venture out: by this means he might possibly escape, and if he staid within, he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62667:33"/> would certainly be taken: Accordingly he came forth thus cloathed, and Gods Providence so ordered it, that the Waiter espying a Maid which he loved and courted passing by on the other side of the Street, stept over to her just as Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> came forth, so that though he stayed but a very little while with her, , and immediately returned again, yet the Bird was flown: Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> was gone: And when the rest came with Power to search the House, the Person whom they sought for was not to be found.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> hid himself in the Country from the Storm till the Parliament was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; and then he repaired to <hi>London,</hi> and continued there, sometimes changing his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, that he might not be commonly known, till his Liberty and Freedom was procured by the means of Sir <hi>Edward Deering,</hi> one of the Knights of the Shire for <hi>Kent,</hi> who, in one <note place="margin">He is resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Liberty.</note> of his Speeches which he made in the House, gave this Character of Mr. <hi>Wilson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> (said he) for so is your Petitioner named, is a Man as <hi>Orthodox</hi> in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as conformable in his Life, as laborious in Preaching as any we have, or that I do know. He is now separated from his People to both their griefs; for 'tis not with him as with others, who are glad to set a <hi>Pursivant</hi> on work, that they may have an excuse to be out of the Pulpit. It is his Delight to preach.</p>
               <p>By this means he obtained his Liberty, and returned to his Charge and wonted pains at <hi>Otham.</hi> But sometime after he was by the Parliament chosen a Member of that Reverend, <note place="margin">He is one of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> Pious, and Learned <hi>Assembly of Divines</hi> which sat at <hi>Westminster;</hi> upon which he sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously attended for the most part of the Week, and notwithstanding his pains there, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his Cure each <hi>Lords-day,</hi> though it was Thirty five, or Thirty six Miles from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> He was much esteemed in the Assembly for his solid, and judicious Discourses upon sundry occasions, and for his meek and humble deportment among them.</p>
               <p>His last Remove was to <hi>Maidston,</hi> the Shire Town of <hi>Kent.</hi> And indeed who was so sit <note place="margin">His Remove to <hi>Maidston.</hi>
                  </note> for so populous a place (where there is but one <hi>English</hi> Congregation) as one of such vast Parts, exemplary Piety, and of so strong a Constitution of Body as he was? And as soon as the way was open for his admission into <hi>Maidston,</hi> (through the Ejection of the former Incumbent by the Committee of <hi>Plundered Ministers)</hi> his old Hearers there, whose Hearts were knit close unto him, longed for his Settlement among them: But the Parliament having made an Order, that plundered Ministers should first be provided for, where any Livings were vacant, they of <hi>Maidston</hi> could not for the present obtain their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: For one Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> (an able and holy man) was by the <hi>Committee of Plundered Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> sent down to that place, yet Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had not been long at <hi>Maidston,</hi> before news was brought that the most able and eminent Ministers should be removed to Cities and great Towns, that they might be capable of doing the more good, and in particular, that Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> should be transplanted from <hi>Otham</hi> to some more considerable place. Upon this Report the People of <hi>Maidston</hi> were much startled, fearing that they should lose their beloved Pastor.</p>
               <p>To prevent which, they applied themselves to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> desiring him to accept of some other Living, that <hi>Maidston</hi> might be free for Mr. <hi>Wilson.</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the vehement desires of the good People after Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> yielded to refer the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to six judicious Ministers of the <hi>Assembly,</hi> whereof three should be chosen by him, and three by them of <hi>Maidston.</hi> The Ministers met accordingly, and having heard what could be said of both sides, and weighed the matter throughly, gave their Advice that it would be best for Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to leave <hi>Maidston</hi> to Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> which he did accordingly, having a considerable place <hi>[viz. Harrison]</hi> about seven Miles from <hi>Maidston</hi> provided for him, to which, so soon as he could with convenience, he removed. And thus at last, by Gods good Providence, Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> and the People of <hi>Maidston</hi> (who at first brought him into <hi>Kent,</hi> and who were long before joined together in Heart,) were now joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Relation, and Habitation, among whom he continued with much Love and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, till God called him out of this World.</p>
               <p>Although Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> now left <hi>Otham,</hi> yet did he not leave to take care for the Souls of his People there; but still retained his Title to that place, lest (if he had resigned it) the <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Piety.</note> Patron should put in an insufficient or unworthy Minister, and himself provided for them a pious, learned, and painful man, to whom he gave the whole profits of the Living. For he held not the Title to the place upon any covetous or worldly Respect, but meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Respect to the good of the Peoples Souls.</p>
               <p>When he had been sometime at <hi>Maidston,</hi> his first care was to promote the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">A Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of the Church, and to see to the due Administration of the Sacraments, according to the Rule of Gods Word: For which end, in his Ministry, he discovered to them the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Church-Ordinances, and of Discipline, with the qualifications of the Subjects
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62667:34"/> thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then (God accompanying his holy Endeavours, notwithstanding the obstructions he met with, not only from the prophane, but also from some that professed the Fear of God,) he in time brought it to a good Issue, and put it in practice, to the great Comfort of them who were truly godly. Upon the Dissolution of the <hi>Assembly,</hi> he being freed from his Attendance there, applied himself wholly to the work of the Ministry, with as great pains and diligence as a man could possibly do.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> Night he usually continued very late at his Studies, yea, often till Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, that he might the better prepare himself for his Work on the <hi>Lords-day.</hi> On <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His great pains.</note> Morning he usually arose by two or three a Clock, and was much displeased with himself if he passed that hour. About seven a Clock he came down to his Family, whom he called together, and read some portion of Scripture to them, which also he expounded, and required those that were present to give him an account of what they remembred of his Exposition: Sung some part of a Psalm: Prayed with them, and concluded all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Eight and Nine a Clock, that they might be all ready to attend the publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>About Nine a Clock he went to Church, and commonly began with singing two staves of a <hi>Psalm;</hi> after which he Prayed briefly for Gods Assistance in, and for Gods Blessing <note place="margin">Sabbaths sanctified.</note> upon his own holy Ordinances; Then he read some part of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded (somtimes three, or four, or more Verses, as more or less matters was contained in them) for the space of an hour; For he had an Hour-Glass in his Desk to guide him therein: He had an excellent faculty and dextery in expounding the Scriptures. His custom was, first to <hi>Analize</hi> the Book, then the Chapters as he came to them; then he gave the several Readings, and Expositions of the Verses which he handled. He had <hi>Junius, Tremelius, Piscator, Calvin, Beza,</hi> and several other <hi>Comentators ad unguem,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that in the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> if at any time they doubted what was the Opinion of any of the aforenamed Authors, Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> was called forth to satisfie them. After he had declared the several Readings, and the Judgments of Expositors, as there was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he drew Observations from the Coherence, Dependance, and matter of the verses which he briefly illustrated and applied.</p>
               <p>Having ended his Exposition, he spent about an hour in the Pulpit: And when he came home to his Family, he constantly went to Prayer with them before Dinner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he begged that the Truths delivered out of the Word might be written by the Spirit of God upon all their Hearts, so as to bring forth fruit in their Lives. Then, usually eating little or no Dinner, he went into his Study till his Family had dined: And then coming down he spent some time with them in singing, and other Religious Exercises. In the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon at Church he did as in the Morning, only his Exposition then was upon some part of the <hi>New Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the publick Duties were ended, many of his Neighbours came to his House, where he called his Family together, required of them, and of others present, an account of his Sermons preached that day; and most of those that were present would tell him som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what; one what the Text was, another the Division of it, another the Doctrine, another the Reasons, and others the Explications and Uses, methodically as he had delivered them, all whom he would help and encourage. Hereby their Understandings and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were much improved. For they, knowing before hand his custom, were the more attentive in hearing, and the more careful to remember what they heard, whereas when the Master of the Family repeats all himself, Children and Servants (who naturally have an aversness to, and hatred of all that is good) are usually heedless in hearing, and mindless both in publick and private of what they hear. After Repetition he sung a Psalm, and concluded with Prayer, and so went to Mr. <hi>Swinock</hi>'s to Supper, who had been his <hi>quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Patron.</hi> And by that time they had supped, there would be a hundred, or more, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together to Mr. <hi>Swinocks</hi> House, to join with him in the conclusion of the day: And among these were persons of all Ranks, the <hi>Mayor, Jurates,</hi> and their Wives, who by their Examples encouraged others to the service of the great God.</p>
               <p>After Supper he came forth amongst them, began with a short Prayer: Then he read the Verses he had expounded in publick in the Fore and After noon, and asked them what Observations were raised from such and such a Verse, till he had gone over all the Verses. Then he enquired what the Texts on which he had preached were, what the Doctrines, Explications, Reasons, and Uses, all in order as he preached them: He seldom named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Head himself, but still heartened them to speak, and only assisted them when they were at a loss. Then they sung a <hi>Psalm,</hi> and he concluded with Prayer about Ten a Clock at Night.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:62667:34"/>
               <p> Once a Month he administred the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> to a considerable number of solid, serious, Christians, which he performed with that Life and Warmth in Prayer, and opening the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">Monthly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> that some of his Communicants have thought themselves in the Suburbs of Heaven when they have joined with him in that Ordinance; in which he usually spent about an hour and an half. Thus he sanctified the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> spending Nine or Ten hours in publick and private Worship, besides what time he spent in secret Duties, in which he was no Nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: So that the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> which was a day of <hi>Rest</hi> to others, was a day of the greatest Pains and Labour to him; yet was it easie because delightful to him: And at the end of the day, when those that took not half his Pains, have complained of their weariness, he would be exceeding lively and chearful: Such was his great Love to his Saviour, and to the Souls of those that were committed to his Charge. The <hi>Sabbath</hi> was to him a <hi>Day of Light and Gladness, and a good Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet he thought it not enough thus to instruct his People on the <hi>Lords-Days,</hi> but the Town being very populous, and the Parish large, whereby he was uncapable of going <note place="margin">His great pains.</note> from House to House, in the Week-days he laid out himself in the service of his Lord for the Benefit of his People. For every <hi>Thursday</hi> (which was their Market day) he preached a Lecture, unto which many Ministers resorted, and sat with delight under his Ministry. On <hi>Fridays</hi> he met in private with as many of his People as would or could come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unto whom he sometimes expounded the Word, sometimes Preached, and always sung and prayed with them.</p>
               <p>Also upon <hi>Mondays</hi> or <hi>Thursdays</hi> (for he altered his day as he saw occasion) he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Days of Conference.</note> a Conference in the publick Meeting-place, where the Question, which before was made known to them, (as what was the Nature of Repentance, of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what the Signs, what the Means, and what the Motives, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> His People were prepared to give in their Answers, and he so demeaned himself therein, that by his wise and courteous Deportment, and pleasing Language, he won their Hearts, and by this means he drew them to the study of the Scriptures, and other good Books, that so they might be able to speak to the purpose.</p>
               <p>As they spake, when he saw occasion, he would help and assist them, still taking care to keep them in the way of Truth, and to see that none did go beyond their bounds by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon the work of the Ministry. When they had done speaking, he would gather together their scattered Notions, bring them into an orderly Method, apply to them suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Texts of Scripture, add of his own what he thought necessary, and so rendered the Meeting exceeding profitable and comfortable to his Flock. <hi>Christian Communion mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Prudence, is that which keeps our Religion in Breath, and without which it will be ready to die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he saw fit to lay down this way of <hi>Conference,</hi> instead thereof he took up <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> in the Week-days in publick; and this he continued till he had gone through all the Town, except some few out-houses, whom also he intended to have Catechised, but was prevented. He did work the work of the Lord, who sent him into the World for that end: He spent himself, as the Silkworm to cloath, and as the Lamp to give Light, to others: He buried not his Talent in a Napkin of Idleness, like too many Ministers, who will rather suffer their Children (to whom they ought to be Nurses) to cry and starve, than be at the pains to draw forth their Breasts unto them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> was of a Noble and Communicative Disposition, very free upon all occasions to impart knowledg unto others; not like a Whirl-pool that sucks all to itself, but as a Fountain that disperses its streams for the Refreshment of many. Seldom were any in his <note place="margin">His painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Company, but they might (if it were not their own fault) receive good by him. He was neither vain in Ostentation, nor niggardly in Reservation: Some may think that he did ill in taking so much pains constantly, both on the <hi>Lords-days,</hi> and on the <hi>Weekdays,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions, to the shortning of his Life; But he never thought that he could labour too much for his Lord and Master, and that God makes no difference between <hi>nequam</hi> and <hi>nequaquam:</hi> An idle and an evil Servant. And for this cause it was, that when he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by his Friends to be mindful of his Body, and not to work it so hard, he was deaf to all such Counsel, and was ready to say with Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> (when he was persuaded by his Friends to take care of his Health) <hi>Would you have my Lord when he comes to find me idle?</hi> And with Dr. <hi>John Reynolds</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> when the Drs. persuaded him <hi>non perdere substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am propter accidens,</hi> replied,
<q>Nec propter Vitam vivendi perdere causas.</q> Coming to a Friends House, when he had travelled neer Forty Miles that day, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his great weariness, he would needs spend some time in Expounding a Portion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62667:35"/> of Scripture to the Family, besides Singing and Prayer (which he never omitted) before he would go to Bed.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Wish was, That when Christ came to call him hence by Death, he might <note place="margin">Time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</note> find him <hi>aut Precantem, aut Predicantem,</hi> either Preaching or Praying: And truly such seemed to be the desire of Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> by his Indefatigable Labours in his Masters business. He was never given to any Recreations (tho never so innocent,) but he was exceeding spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in his Expence of time. A little after Dinner he would sometimes sit and discourse a while; but usually, if he was at home, his Study was the constant place of his Abode. He was <hi>Helluo Librorum,</hi> an Indefatigable Student, stealing time from his Sleep (and that when his Body needed and called for it) to his Book. It is recorded of Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> Martyr, that he slept not above Four Hours in a Night, and that his Book went not out of his Hand till Sleep came: And that Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> rose, Summer and Winter, at Two a Clock in the Morning. And of another Martyr its said, he was spare of Meat, sparer of Sleep, but sparest of Time. So Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> made much Conscience of his Expence of Time, especially upon the <hi>Lords-days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he was invited to a Feast, his Zeal for God's Glory, and the good of Souls was <note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> such, that commonly after Dinner he would call for a <hi>Bible,</hi> sing a <hi>Psalm,</hi> expound some Verses of Scripture, and pray with his Friends. Mr. <hi>Will. Fenner</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> (that eminent Servant of <hi>Jesus Christ)</hi> meeting Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> once at Mr. <hi>Butcher</hi>'s House, was so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken with his active, chearful Spirit for God and Godliness, that he said to Mr. <hi>Butcher, I am even ashamed of my self to see how Mr.</hi> Wilson <hi>gallopeth towards Heaven, and I do but creep on a Snails pace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though he was a good Linguist, and well read, both in ancient and modern Authors, yet (ordinarily) he Preached, though always with Evidence of Reason, yet still in a plain, <note place="margin">His manner of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and clear Stile, by Doctrine, Reason and Use, that so he might be understood by the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Capacity. His constant Preaching shewed that he was an able workman: His Doctrines were clearly raised from his Text: His Heads pertinent to his Subject, and he had a rare faculty in applying suitable Scriptures (which is the principal way of convincing mens Judgments, for it is the Authority of God that must do the Work) to all his Heads. On the <hi>Lords-days</hi> in the Afternoon, for some considerable time, he Preached over the Heads of Divinity, and therein he discovered so much Learning and Judgment in his plain Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if these Sermons had been preached in either of the Universities, they would have been highly approved.</p>
               <p>He was so much esteemed for his great abilities, that there was scarce any publick Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for Sermons in the Country, but he was chosen to preach them. Somtimes he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">His Family Duties.</note> bfore the Judges of the <hi>Assizes,</hi> and twice before the <hi>Parliament.</hi> He was not of the number of them, who are zealous abroad to get themselves a name, but cold and careless at home, not much minding what becomes of their Families: But as <hi>David, He walked in the midst of his House with a perfect Heart,</hi> and brought up his Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. He was as good within as without Doors. Every Morning and Evening be read some part of the Scriptures, expounded it to them, sung part of a <hi>Psalm,</hi> and prayed. He used often to ask his Children Questions about the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Examined them on the <hi>Lords-days</hi> about his Sermons, and caused them to learn sundry portions of the Scripture without Book.</p>
               <p>It is Recorded of B. B <hi>Hooper,</hi> that he so governed his House that in every Corner of it there was some smell of Virtue, of good Example, honest Conversation, and reading the Scriptures. If it was not so in Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> House, surely the fault was not the want of a good Governour. He Prayed often with his Wife apart from the Family, and himself spent much time in secret Prayer, knowing that of <hi>Lactantius</hi> to be a great Truth, <hi>Non est vera Religio quae cum Templo relinquitur:</hi> That's no true Religion, when we leave it behind us at Church.</p>
               <p>He was very exact and watchful always to set a good Example before his Children and <note place="margin">His holy Life.</note> Servants, knowing that such are led and formed more by the Eye than by the Ear; and what their Superiours <hi>do,</hi> than of what they <hi>say:</hi> and indeed his whole Conversation was a practical Exposition upon the Gospel; and what he taught on the <hi>Lords-day</hi> in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he preached over all the Week in his Life. He was exemplary in his Converses with all men, and spake much by his carriage, even when he was silent, and spake not a word. His good works were unanswerable <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> invincible <hi>Demonstrations</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his Neighbours, whereby he drew their Hearts, and engaged their Affections after the Beauty of Holiness. He practised what he preached, and did what he taught. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Be thou an Example in words, in Conversation, in Charity, in Purity.</hi> Tit. 2. 7. <hi>In all things shew thy self a Pattern of good works</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62667:35"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maidston</hi> before Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi>'s coming was a very prophane Town: They used to have Morrice-Dancing, Cudgel-playing, Stool-ball, Crickets, and mnay other sports openly, and <note place="margin">Sabbath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> publickly on the <hi>Lords-day;</hi> yea, they would jeer, and deride such as professed Godliness, and went abroad to hear Sermons on the <hi>Lords-days</hi> when they had none at home. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly after the Evening Service, many used to go to the Ale house, others to walk in the Fields: And it was their constant custom to ply the Conduits on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Water. Indeed the former vain, and sinful customs of Sports was reformed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came; But by his preaching he prevailed with them to forbear vain walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, fitting idly at their doors, as also to fetch their Water on <hi>Saturday</hi> Nights, which they were to use on the <hi>Lords-day:</hi> Insomuch that though the Town was large and full of People, yet you should hardly see one person in the Streets after the Sermons on the <hi>Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:</hi> So that when the <hi>Mayor</hi> hath searched the Inns, and Ale-houses, he hath scarce found one Townsman there.</p>
               <p>One of the Judges at an <hi>Assize</hi> taking notice of it, said publickly, <hi>That in all his Circuit he never came to a Town where the</hi> Lords-day <hi>was observed so strictly.</hi> Yea, by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry he so wrought upon the People, that the very Pot▪hearbs were gathered and made ready on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> and the provision for their Dinners was fitted for the Fire against that day. He was much of the mind of those Primitive Christians, who when any of them were asked, <hi>Servasti Dominicum?</hi> Hast thou kept the <hi>Lords-day?</hi> Answered, <hi>Christianus sum, omittere non possum:</hi> I am a Christian, I cannot neglect it. The Sanctification of that day is exceeding useful to keep up the power of Godliness in our Hearts and Lives. And as God on that day bestows great Blessings upon them that humbly and reverently wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, on that <hi>Queen of Days,</hi> that <hi>Market-day of our Souls,</hi> (a. 58. 13, 14.) so he hath inflicted dreadful Judgments on the Prophaners of it, and when men have neglected to punish them, God hath taken the Sword into his own Hand, and done it himself. <hi>See sundry Examples of it in my first Vol. of Examples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Example there was in <hi>Maidston</hi> before the Reformation wrought by Mr. <hi>Wilson.</hi> On a <hi>Sabbath</hi> day as some Children were playing in the Streets, near unto a Wall, against which some Waggon-Wheels were set up, there came a sudden gust of Wind, which blew down a Wheel upon one of the Children, and crushed it to death.</p>
               <p>Upon the Week-days also (such was the Blessing of God upon his Ministry and holy <note place="margin">Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Town.</note> Example) many Families did set up Religious Exercises both Mornings and Evenings, so that if you had walked through the <hi>Great Street</hi> about Nine or Ten a Clock in a Morning, you might hear them singing in many Families: For it was their manner, together with Reading and Prayer, to join singing.</p>
               <p>He was of a couragious and undaunted Spirit, not discouraged by any obstacles, which <note place="margin">His Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> lay in his way of Duty. He feared God and none else: He was like St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who, having a threatning Message sent him by the Empress, bid the Messenger return this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>Nil nisi peccatum timeo:</hi> I fear nothing but Sin. And like Dr. <hi>Rowland Tailor,</hi> who in the time of the <hi>Marian</hi> Persecution, being persuaded by his Friends to fly, said, <hi>I know the Cause to be so good, and the Truth so strong on my side, that I will (by Gods Grace) appear before them, and to their Beards resist their felse doings; for I believe I shall never be able to do God so good Service as now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He shewed his Courage also in his bold reproving of Sin: For as Christ said of the <note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> Church of <hi>Ephesus, He could not bear those that were evil. Elijah</hi> durst reprove <hi>Ahab,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> feared not to reprehend the greatest, when there was cause for it. If men were bold in sinning, he was as bold in telling them of it, and in giving their Sins the due Accents. Yet as a wise <hi>Physician,</hi> he could distinguish between Pimples and Plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sores; between Infirmities and Scandals, and dealt with them accordingly.</p>
               <p>He was very zealous for God and his Glory, embracing all opportunities of doing him Service, and wherever he came he promoted the strict Observation of the <hi>Lords-day;</hi> and this he did the rather, because he observed what dishonour was done unto God by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness and contempt of Gods Ordinances by some, and by the Errours, and wilful with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings from the Ordinances by others, which he bewailed bitterly to his dying day <note place="margin">He opposed Schisms.</note> Some, who it's hoped had the root of the Matter in them, questioned his Call to the Ministry, nay, suspected his Call to be <hi>Antichristrian,</hi> and so separated from him, though they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al acknowledged that he was their spiritual Father, and had begotten them to God through the Gospel, to whom he might say as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did to the <hi>Corinthians: Ye are the Seal of our Ministry: Do we need, as some others, Letters of Commendation to you? Ye are our Epistle, known and read of all men; For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministred by us, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62667:36"/>
                  <hi>not in Tables of Stone, but in fleshly Tables of the Heart,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 1, 2, 3.

               <p>The great danger of their immortal Souls, as also of those who did wholly cast off the <note place="margin">His Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and Schism.</note> care of their eternal good, caused him in the course of his Sermons and Expositions, when the Scriptures led him to it, to reprove their sins <hi>sharply,</hi> according to the Command of the Holy Ghost, and he could do it <gap reason="foreign">

'Tis reported of St. <hi>Bazil.</hi> that one hearing much Commendations of him, had a great desire to know what manner of man he was: Hereupon in a Vsion there was represented to him a Flame of Fire, with this <hi>Motto, Talis est Basilius:</hi> Such an one is <hi>Bazil.</hi> And truly such a Man was Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> meek and cold when at any time himself was reproached and abused, but as hot as fire in the Cause of God. The Zeal of God's House did even burn him up. Errours and Heresies were very odious to him, such was his love to the Truth. It might be said of him as it was of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that he was <hi>Haeretico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Malleus,</hi> the Maul of Hereticks: And as of Mr. <hi>Arthur Hildersham,</hi> that he was <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticorum Malleus,</hi> The Hammer of Schismaticks. He often quoted and commented upon those Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. with much warmth and vigour, that, if it were possible, he might reduce and bring back such as went astray.</p>
               <p>And though such as were touched in their sores were angry, and said it was passion, and that his natural heat was Kitchen-Fire, the effect of his natural Spirit, yet those that were judicious knew it to be otherwise, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was <hi>a Coal from the Altar;</hi> true Zeal; the Fruit of Gods Spirit in him; knowing that <hi>he was set up for the defence of the Gospel,</hi> as <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 17. Some of those that separated were very dear unto him, of whom he might say as <hi>David, It was not an Enemy that reproached me, then I could have born it willingly: Was it he that hated me, that did magnifie himself against me? But it was my Friend and mine Acquaintance; we took sweet Counsel together, and (formerly) walked to the House of God in Company,</hi> Psal. 55. 12, 13, 14. But as dear as they were to him, the Truths of the Gospel were much dearer. <hi>Amicus</hi> Socrates, <hi>amicus</hi> Plato, <hi>sed magis amica Veritas.</hi> He was a man of such clear convincing Light, and as its said of <hi>Apollos, (Act.</hi> 18. 24.) <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, able, strong, mighty in the Scriptures, that had they been wilfully blind, or very weak Ey'd, they must have seen their Errours. It's observed by some as a special Providence, that the same day in which <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Heretick was born in our <hi>Britain,</hi> St. <hi>Austin,</hi> the great Confuter of his Heresie, was born in <hi>Africk;</hi> God so disposing it that the Poison and the Antidote should come into the World together: So was it a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to <hi>Maidston,</hi> that in a time when so many Errours sprung up, there was such an able and faithful Husbandman to watch them and root them out; Otherwise many more than did, might have <hi>faln from their own stedfastness,</hi> and been led away with the Errours and Heresies of the Times.</p>
               <p>He was not only sound in the Faith, and held fast the Form of sound words, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Faith.</note> 13.) But also, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> he was strong in the Faith, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 4. 20.) And in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est dangers and difficulties could rely upon God, and trust him with himself, and all that he had. He met with much opposition (as is before declared) both from open Enemies, and seeming Friends: For <hi>Satan</hi> knowing him to be so great an Enemy to his Kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, both by his Exemplary Life, and sound Doctrine, raised great Winds and Storms, if it were possible, to put out this <hi>burning and shining Light:</hi> Yet still he remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted in the midst of all, <hi>not moved by any of those things, neither counted he his Life dear unto him, so he might finish his course with joy, and the Ministry which he received of the Lord Jesus,</hi> (Act. 20. 24.) He minded his own work, consulted his Duty, and left Gods work (the Issues and Events of all) to God himself.</p>
               <p>He was an immoveable Rock, though the Waters beat sore upon him, and had often <note place="margin">His Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> that saying of <hi>Luther</hi> in his Mouth, <hi>Mallem ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p> Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> was a Man that had lived much above the World; the great things thereof were little in his Eyes: Though his Habitation was on Earth, his Conversation was in <note place="margin">His heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Heaven. Indeed he had but a small Estate considering his great Charge; but a poor man may be as earthly and covetous as one that is rich: For Covetousness doth not lie in the Chest, or in Bags, or great Mannours, but in the Heart. But he was Master of, not Slave to that little which he had. His Mind was sitted to his Estate, and notwithstanding he had many opportunities and advantages for the getting of Riches, if he had sought after them, yet he never made use of them for that purpose. He was wholly taken up with his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in Heaven, and was so far from minding of earthly things, that he seldom or never meddled with them, but left the management of them to his pious and prudent Yoke-Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. His indifferency to the things of this Life was admirable. A little before the Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in <hi>Kent, Anno Christi</hi> 1648. there was an Hundred Pounds brought into Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s <note place="margin">Contempt of the world.</note> House, being a Legacy given to his eldest Daughter, by Mr. <hi>Brigg,</hi> a gracious man, and one of the Jurats of <hi>Maidston,</hi> (which was the greatest Portion that any of his Children had,) which Money, in time of the Insurrection, was by the Souldiers (when they search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his House for Arms) discovered, and taken away, (though it was soon restored again) Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> being then at <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When afterwards the Country was quiet, and Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> was returned to his House again, an intimate Friend asked him whether he was not much troubled when he heard that his Money was gone? He answered, <hi>That he was no more troubled when he heard that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was carried out of his House, than he was when he heard it was brought into his House.</hi> The same Friend asked him what frame of Spirit he was in when he went from <hi>Maidston?</hi> For the Town and County being in Arms, many of the mean and prophane Rabble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him, when he was going out of the Town, and took his Horse by the Bridle, and twice or thrice led him back again, crying out, <hi>Wilson, Wilson,</hi> where is your God now? He answered his Friend thus: <hi>Truly I thought</hi> (when they blasphemously said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, where is your God?) <hi>on that Text,</hi> My God is in Heaven and hath done whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he pleased. <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 3.</p>
               <p>Great were his Gifts as well as his Graces: God was pleased to bestow upon him very <note place="margin">His natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> large natural Endowments, whereby he became much the more capable of doing good. He had a quick apprehension, a clear Understanding, a deep and sound Judgment, and a most tenacious Memory. He was none of those Preachers whose Tongues are galloping, whilest sober Reason and convincing Sense standeth still, or at best doth but creep. He dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his strong Judgment in few words. His Body was of a strong Constitution, and truly so was his Soul. He would presently find out the meaning of hard Authors, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he read was his own: Few have the like strength of Memory. Though he was <note place="margin">His Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> careful to write down his Sermons, Heads, Proofs, and Explication, yet in the Pulpit he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made use of any Notes.</p>
               <p>He made a good use of his Memory; it was not like a Childs Pocket, stuffed with trash, but as the <hi>Ark,</hi> wherein the two Tables were laid up. He had scarce his equal for his Remembrance of the sacred Scriptures: He was tried for a good while together: One took a Bible and read a Verse in one Chapter, and another a Verse in another, and so went forwards and backwards, both as to the Books, Chapters, and Verses of the Scripture, and he all along told the Reader the Verse, Chapter, and Book, without mistaking any one Text; and himself said, <hi>That he believed he could tell the Book, Chapter, and Verse, which any should read to him all the day long:</hi> Much whereof appeared in his Prayers; For on a Fast day he hath prayed an hour together, and most of the time in Scripture Phrases. The Word of God was dear unto him, his daily Delight and Meditation.</p>
               <p>And that which made all his parts useful, was, that he made <hi>Hagar</hi> to wait on <hi>Sarah;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> and as <hi>David</hi> consecrated the Spoils taken from the Gentiles to the Temple: So he dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his natural accomplishments to his God, and made them serviceable before his own honour.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all his great, natural, and gratious Accomplishments, he was cloathed <note place="margin">Humility.</note> with Humility: None thought so meanly of him as he thought of himself: His Face, like <hi>Moses</hi>'s shined, so that all his judicious friends could not but observe and admire it, yet he knew it not: He had not the least affectation or shew of Ostentation in his deportment, Language, or any other way.</p>
               <p>Empty Vessels make the greatest sound; those which are full are the more silent. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Pride, Emptiness and Arrogance are usual Concommitants: He knew much, yet the more sensible he was of his Ignorance, Nothingness, and Unworthiness, and walked the more humbly with his God. As a Bough laden with Fruit or an Ear with Corn, the fuller
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62667:37"/> and weightier, the more they bend downward: He (as a Violet) hung down and hid his Head, though his Fragrancy and Sweetness discovered what he was.</p>
               <p>In his Apparel he was always grave and sober, never minding the whimsical Modes or Fashions, but ever kept to the same manner of Attire. A Friend standing with him at his door, when a great Gallant <hi>antickly</hi> habited went by, whereupon he privately said, <hi>I have made a Covenant with mine Eyes, why should I behold Vanity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This good Man was surely excellently accomplished, seeing he had such rich natural Gifts, and such great gracious Habits, which, as the Diamond to the Ring, added true <note place="margin">His rare Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> value to his Naturals. Alas! What are all natural Abilities without Grace, but as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers without a Figure, insignificant, and in Gods account standing for nothing? Nay, usually the greater Parts, the greater profaness: Satan makes much use of such acute Wits, as sharp Swords to do the more mischief: At best they are but as Toads with Pearls in their Heads, and Poison in their whole Bodys. But Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> had this happiness to have his great Gifts adorned and enameled with great Graces, whereby he hourly became the greater Instrument of God's Glory.</p>
               <p>When he was about Twenty six years old he married the Daughter of Sir<hi>—Zinzan,</hi> who being in a Consumption before she was married to him, (for Love of him, her Parents <note place="margin">His Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> judging him much below her,) died within seven or eight Months after she married him.</p>
               <p>About a Year after her death, he married Mrs. <hi>Damaris Cable</hi> (Daughter of Mr. <hi>James Cable</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Merchant,) who was a meet help to him both in his civil and sacred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns: By her he had Eleven Children: His eldest Son <hi>[Samuel,]</hi> who feared the Lord in his Youth, died young, the other Ten he left all living at his death with his desolate Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. He had little of this worlds Goods to leave to his many Children, not above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds a piece, and that after the decease of his Widow; yet he left them much if we consider the many fervent Prayers which night and day he poured out before the Lord in their behalfs. It's recorded of a good and gracious Woman, who, when she lay on her Death-Bed, said thus to her Children; <hi>I have little to leave you; but this I must tell you, there is not one room in the House which is not perfumed with Prayers for you.</hi> Often did this holy man cry out, <hi>O that my Children might live in thy sight! Lord come down by thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into their Hearts, lest my Children die, lest they die eternally.</hi> He had the happiness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to the good man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 128. 3. <hi>Thy Wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the sides of thine House: Thy Children like Olive Plants round about thy Table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Piety which did shine so brightly in his Life did sparckle wonderfully at his Death. <note place="margin">His Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> The Messenger which the Lord sent to call him hence (for <hi>Morbus est via ad Mortem)</hi> was a violent Fever, which he welcomed, as knowing it was sent by a gracious Father, to call him home to his Fathers House. No guest comes at any time amiss to him that keeps a constant Table: No Providence, no nor Death itself can come any time amiss to him that is always ready, and that dieth daily while he lives. Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> Lamps were burning, his <hi>Oil</hi> was ready in his Vessel, when the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> came.</p>
               <p>His Fever had continued but a little while before his Friends did <hi>Prognosticate,</hi> that it <note place="margin">His carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in his Sickness.</note> would prove Mortal, and remove him from them, whom they loved as their own Souls, and under whose Ministry they had sat with so much delight. But what he had been in the course of his Life, the same he continued to be to his Death. Though his Disease was violent, and his Fits often acute and sharp, yet he never complained. Groan he might, yet he did never grumble. His pain might cause him to mourn, but it did not make him murmur: He reverenced the Rod in the Hand of his Father; and that Cup which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave him to drink he submitted to. In his extremity his Faith and Patience did emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently shine forth to the Honour and Glory of God, and to the great comfort of those about him, and those that came to visit him.</p>
               <p>Being sensible of his approaching Death, he was exceeding sollicitous for the Town and <note place="margin">His care for his People.</note> Parish whereof he was Minister. It is an excellent Speech of <hi>Laelius</hi> (in <hi>Cicer. de amicit.) Mihi non minori curae est, qualis Respublica post mortem meam futura sit, quam qualis hodie sit:</hi> My care is as great what shall become of the Common-Wealth when I am dead, as what it shall do while I live. So this good Man was very sollicitous what should become of his People when God should call him away. As <hi>Moses</hi> before he died was careful to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Successor that might lead Gods People (which he had brought unto the very Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) into the Land of Promise, the Earthly <hi>Canaan:</hi> So Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> before he died took care for a Successor that might further that good work that he had begun, through Grace, in many of his People, and to be helpful to conduct them to their heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> And for this end he sent for some of the Town, who were prudent and gratious, and advised them to consider of some able and godly Minister to succeed in his place: And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62667:37"/> unto them Mr. <hi>John Crump,</hi> a worthy Minister, as the fittest that he know, to be their Pastor; and accordingly Mr. <hi>Crump</hi> did succeed him, not only in his place, but also in his Faithfulness and Diligence, and Serviceableness to the great comfort, and advantage of the People.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Jacob</hi> before his Death called his Children together, to direct and foretel them <note place="margin">He blesseth his Wife &amp; Children.</note> what should befall them, so Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> called his Wife and Children to him, and desired his Wife not to be discouraged at his Death, nor to <hi>sorrow as those that have no hope;</hi> but to continue to serve God in Christ, to trust God, and be chearful in him; adding this for her comfort, that though now they must part for a time, yet that there was a time coming when they should be joined again, never to part any more, his Children were most of them young, but those that were capable of Instruction, he exhorted to labour for the Fear of God betimes; and directing his Speech to his elder Daughter, he said, <hi>Look you to it that you meet me not at the day of Judgment in an Unregenerate State.</hi> And so he commended all his Children to the Lord, and left them with him in much Faith in the Covenant which God had made to him and his.</p>
               <p>When Christian Friends came to visit him, he always endeavoured to requite their <note place="margin">His Counsel to his Friends.</note> kindness by giving them godly Counsel and Exhortation: He advised them to be frequent in reading the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to prize highly, and to meditate much upon the Promises; to be holy and blameless in their Conversations; by no means to forsake, but stick close to all Gods Ordinances, and to hold on in Communion with Gods People in the Town. 'Tis reported of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> that when he had broken his Leg, he discoursed with his Friends as if his Soul had been in another mans Body; and when the Bones of Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> were fore vexed with the violence of his Disease, he used to discourse in such a composed Heavenly <note place="margin">His pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> manner, as if he had ailed nothing.</p>
               <p>When one or two of those who had separated from Communion with him came to visit him, he did with much affection bewail their <hi>Schism,</hi> and prayed that God would bring them back again; and told them that he could willingly lay down his Life, so they might join in Communion with the other godly People in the Town. <note place="margin">Schism re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was dying <hi>worshipped, leaning on his Staff,</hi> (Heb. 11. 21.) so he on his Death-Bed was frequent in praying to, and praising God. Two nights before his death (though he was very sick and weak) yet he made his Bed his Pulpit, out of which he preached to some that came to see him, concerning the pretiousness of the Promises, and bad them to look on that Text, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding rich and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Promises commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>
                  <hi>pretious Promises, that by these you might be Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> &amp;c. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the pretiousness of Christ to believers, he desired them to turn to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that believe he is pretious.</hi> And Oh, with what affectionate Expressions did this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and Member of Christ commend his Head, the Pearl of inestimable value, and the Promise which he had so dearly purchased, saying to them, <hi>That one of those Promises was more pretious than all the World!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He kept a pure Conscience while he lived, and through Gods Mercy, had a peaceable <note place="margin">Conscience good.</note> Conscience when he died. 'Tis said of <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> that being asked on his Death-Bed, whether the Light did not offend him, clapping his Hands on his Breast he said, <hi>Hic sat lucis:</hi> Here is Light enough within: Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> all the time of his sickness manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much Calmness and Serenity of Spirit. 'Tis recorded of Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Martyr, that when he came within two Miles of <hi>Hadley,</hi> the place where he was to suffer, he fetched a Frisk and said, <hi>God be praised, I am almost at my journeys End: I have but two stiles to go over, and then I am at my Fathers House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apprehensions that Death drew near were very comfortable to Mr. <hi>Wilson.</hi> A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of his Society coming to take her leave of him, (being about to remove out of <note place="margin">Comfort at Death.</note>
                  <hi>Maidston)</hi> he pleasantly said to her, <hi>What will you say</hi> (good Mrs. <hi>Crisp) if I get the start of you, and get to Heaven before you get to</hi> Dover? When another came to visit him, he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her what she thought of him: She answered, Truly Sir, I think you are not far from your Fathers House: To which he replied, <hi>That's good News indeed, and is enough to make one laugh for joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When others spake to him of his Death in a mournful way, he said unto them: <hi>I bless God who hath suffered me to live so long, to do him some service: And now I have done the work appointed me, that he is pleased to call me away so soon.</hi> Thus in the Breathings of his <note place="margin">His death.</note> Faith and Hope, he departed this Life, and commended his Spirit into the Hands of him that redeemed it, and that on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> upon which Day he used to work so hard, which now was the day of his Eternal Rest, where he keeps an endless <hi>Sabbath, Anno Christi.</hi> 1657.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62667:38"/>
               <p> He needeth no Picture nor Monuments to preserve his Memory. His good Works (though transient in themselves, are yet permanent in the Hearts of many) and <hi>praise him in the Gate:</hi> For as <hi>Agesilaus</hi> dying said, <hi>If I have done good that will be my Monument; if ill, all the Statues you can make will not keep my Good Name alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he died he was about Fifty two Years old; of a strang Constitution for strength, and might in the course of Nature (if God had so pleased) have lived much longer: But he brought forth good fruit early, and was ripe when others of his age began but toblossom, and therefore it was no wonder though God gathered him to himself so soon. He was in his Meridian, when others were but just peeping above the Horizon, and therefore might well set before them.</p>
               <p>It was much desired and prayed for by many that he might have lived longer, but God's time is best, and his time is come: He <hi>had fought a good fight, he had finished his Course, he had kept the Faith,</hi> and his Master called him to receive his <hi>Crown.</hi> It may be said of him as one said of B. B. <hi>Juel, Diu vixit, etsi non diu fuit:</hi> He lived long and much in a little time. He did not waste out with the Rust of Idleness, but did wear out with Labour; yet he was a Light that did not blaze out needlesly and unprofitably, but burnt out for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning of many, and directing them in the way of Life; which Life himself now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth: And <hi>happy are they whom when their Lord comes shall find so doing: Of a truth I say unto you, he shall make them Rulers over all that he hath.</hi> Luk. 12. 43, 44.</p>

                     <hi>A Testimony given by a Reverend and godly Neighbour Minister concerning Mr.</hi> Wilson.</head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>Wilson</hi>'s natural parts (saith he) were generally known to be very high: In depth of Judgment, readiness of Memory, and quickness of Apprehension: He was best <note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> at much in a little, with clearness of Judgment, and exactness of Method that I have heard, or am ever like to hear, His spiritual Endowments for Graces and Gifts were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable. In his Ministerial Abilities, he was taller by the Head and Shoulders than most of his Brethren: His indefatigable pains were answerable to his parts, which wore out his Spirits, and spent him for good, to be the sooner with God: And that which to me adorned all, was the depth of his Humility in the height of his Sanctity. He had well learned that hard Lesson, to receive much from God: and yet to be little in his own Eyes. His Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is yet pretious to my Thoughts: The general loss is great, yours in particular at <hi>Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> greater. I shall heartily desire that his indefatigable Labours, and pious exemplary Life may still live in your Lives, in which he, though dead, yet speaketh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <l>Though long deceas'd, to sigh a Verse</l>
                     <l>To offer at a Kingdoms Hearse,</l>
                     <l>And not sit mute in discontent:</l>

                     <l>I could whole Floods of Waters weep.</l>
                     <l>I could, as <hi>Niobe,</hi> bemoan</l>

               <p>I Have no Account of his Parentage, Birth, and Education in his younger Years: About the time that the All-wise God translated him hence, he was pleased, within a little space to take to himself many learned, godly, and able Ministers, which, without doubt, was a presage of the dreadful and terrible Judgments which ensued not long after: And it was the greater Judgment, because most People were so little sensible of it. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 1. <hi>The Righteous perisheth</hi> (saith the Evangelical Prophet) <hi>and no man layeth it to Heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come.</hi> The <hi>Jewish Rabbins</hi> have a saying, <hi>Quando Luminaria patiuntur Eclipsin, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum est signum Mundo:</hi> It is an ill sign to the World when the <hi>Luminaries</hi> of Heaven ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eclipsed.</p>
               <p>God extinguished many glorious Lights about that time, especially in and about <hi>London,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gataker.</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> &amp;c. And in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> Dr. <hi>Arrowsmith,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Samuel Bolton,</hi> sometimes Mr. of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Colledge there: Upon whose Commendation if we should enter, it may be truly said what <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> said of his Sister <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> That there is more fear that we shoul speak too little, than that we should speak too much.</p>
               <p>He was a <hi>Burning and a shining Light</hi> in this our <hi>Israel:</hi> An <hi>Interpreter one of a Thousand:</hi> A man of excellent Ministerial Abilities: A <hi>workman that needed not be ashamed, dividing aright the word of Truth.</hi> He was one that did study not only <gap reason="foreign">

As <hi>Nazianzen</hi> said concerning <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> (who is called, <hi>The voice of the Cryer,)</hi> that he was <hi>All Voice:</hi> A Voice in his Habit; a Voice in his Diet; a Voice in his Dwelling; A Voice in his Conversation as well as in his Preaching: So that it may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said of this <hi>Man of God,</hi> he was <hi>Tota Vox,</hi> All Voice: A Voice in his Life as well as in his Doctrine. He lived his own Sermons, and preached louder by his good Conversation, than by his Heavenly Doctrine; <hi>Nam vita Praedicatorum est vocalissima:</hi> The Life of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters is the Life of their Ministry, and Teachers Sins are the teachers of Sins.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62667:40"/>
               <p> What <hi>Ruffinus</hi> said of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> may fitly be applied to this Reverend and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Minister; He did those things himself that he taught to others, neither did he condemn himself by practising contrary to what he preached. He had not only <hi>Dona honoraria,</hi> but <hi>Dona salutifera;</hi> Not only Gifts for the good of others, but Graces for the good of his own Soul. There are many Ministers that have rare Gifts, but they are like a Pearl in a Toads Head, a Pearl in the Head, but the Body all Poison, bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Applause from others did not make him proud.</p>

                  <note place="margin">What makes a Minister.</note> and <hi>Temptation.</hi> Our Christian Brother was not only a man of Prayer, Reading, and Meditation, but a man assaulted with manifold Temptations; yea, probably with more than many hundreds of Ministers are.

And he left a Writing behind him wherein he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded all the outgoings of God towards him, and all the Experiences of Gods shining with the Light of his Countenance upon him; and also of his withdrawings, and hiding his Face from him. He hath written down both the <hi>Apogaum's</hi> and <hi>Perigaeum's</hi> (as I may so say,) both those times wherein God stood at a distance from him, and when he approached <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> nearer to him.</p>
               <p>His desire of winning Souls to Christ by his Preaching, was so great, that though he was <note place="margin">His painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Head of a Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and had no Ministerial charge of his own, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he preached <hi>gratis</hi> once every <hi>Lords day</hi> for many Years together. The like is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of that Reverend, Godly, and Learned Minister Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> somtimes Master of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> Colledge.</p>
               <p>This worthy Dr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> in the ordinary course of his Ministry, had a little before his Death preached over the third Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> to the latter end of the Twentieth Verse, and was come to Verse the One and Twentieth; <hi>Who shall change our vile Body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious Body, according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.</hi> And it pleased God by his Providence so to order it, that Mr. <hi>Edward Calamy</hi> preaching at his Funeral, happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he made choice of this very Verse (though he knew nothing of this till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) for his Text at his Burial. But though Dr. <hi>Bolton</hi> lived not to preach upon this <note place="margin">A special providence.</note> Verse, yet he now lives in Heaven, waiting for that blessed time when his vile Body shall be raised out of his Grave, and be made like unto the glorious Body of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Before he was made Master of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Colledge, he preached three or four Years at St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s <hi>Ludgate, London:</hi> Also six or seven Years at St. <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Southwark;</hi> And for some time at St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s <hi>Holborn,</hi> in all places to the great satisfaction of all the godly that waited upon his Ministry. And though he be now dead, yet he still speaks, not only by the Holiness of his Life, and graciousness of his Doctrine, but also by the many excellent Books which he hath lest in Print, in which may be beheld a fair Character of his Piety, and Ministerial Abilities.</p>
               <p>He was very <hi>Orthodox</hi> and sound in his Judgment: He had no Spiritual Leprosie in his <note place="margin">His works.</note> Head, witness those two Books of his, called, <hi>The Arraignment of Errour,</hi> and <hi>A Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rights of the Law, and Liberties of Grace.</hi> He was of a publick Spirit, witness that Book of his, called, <hi>A Word in Season to a sinking Kingdom.</hi> He was very careful in admitting Men and Women to the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> witness that Book of his called, <hi>The Wedding Garment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time of his Sickness was long, tedious, and costly: His Diseases many, very many, <note place="margin">His Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> but his Patience was exceeding great. He would usually say, that though the Providences of God were dark towards him, yet he had Light within. A little before he died, he said to one that was lifting him up, <hi>Let me alone, let me lie quietly, for I have as much comfort as my Heart can hold.</hi> The last time that Mr. <hi>Calimy</hi> visitted him, he found him wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously desirous to be dissolved, and to be with Christ: He said, <hi>Oh this vile Carcass of mine!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Death desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>
                  <hi>When will it give way that my Soul may get out and go to my God? When will this rotten Carcass be consumed, that I may mount up to Heaven?</hi> And when he saw any probable <hi>Symptoms</hi> of Death, (which he called, <hi>The little Crevises at which his Soul did peep out,)</hi> he was exceeding joyful.</p>
               <p>It was his desire to be buried without any Funeral Pomp, which may mind us of a saying <note place="margin">His humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> recorded by <hi>Melchior-Adamus</hi> in the Life of <hi>Pellitan,</hi> of an Uncle of his who would not be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62667:40"/> buried in his Scholastick Habit (as the custom in that Country then was) <hi>Testamento cavit</hi> (saith he) <hi>ne aliter sepeliretur quam simplex alius Christianus:</hi> He ordered it in his last Will and Testament, to be buried as a private Christian, and not as a Doctor, and the Reason he gave was, because he hoped, <hi>Resurrecturum se ad judicium, non ut Sacerdotem &amp; Docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, sed ut humilem Christianum;</hi> That he should rise at the day of Judgment, and appear before God, not as a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or a Doctor, but as an humble Christian. This was the desire and hope of our Reverend Brother, and this Text preached upon at his Funeral was matter of great rejoicing unto him, whilest he thought on that day, wherein his <hi>vile Body,</hi> subject to so many Diseases, should be made like unto the glorious Body of Christ, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the working, the mighty working</hi> (as he three times repeated) <hi>whereby he is able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things to himself:</hi> And so he quietly slept in the Lord, and was honourably buried in <note place="margin">His death.</note> the Church of St. <hi>Martins Lungate, Octob.</hi> the 16th. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1654.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>RIchard Vines</hi> was born at a Town called <hi>Blazon,</hi> in the County of <hi>Leicester,</hi> about <note place="margin">His Birth &amp; Education.</note> the Year 1600. His Parents finding his Towardliness and Ingenuity, kept him at School till he was fit for the University, and then sent him to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he was admitted into <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge; In which place he soon discovered much quickness of Wit, and pregnancy of Parts, which, though they were lively and facetious, yet never sinful or prophane.</p>
               <p>In that Colledge he followed his studies very hard, and profited much in the Arts and <note place="margin">His profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</note> Tongues: And after he had continued some good time in the University, going into his own Country, he was chosen to be a Schoolmaster at <hi>Hinckly,</hi> a little Market-Town, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon <hi>Warwickshire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There he continued for some good time, training up his Scholars in Religion and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till the Death of Mr. <hi>James Crunford,</hi> head Schoolmaster in the Free-School of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,</hi> who also was Rector of <hi>Weddington</hi> in the same County; by whose death that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory <note place="margin">He is chosen to <hi>Wedding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                  </note> falling void, Mr. <hi>Adderly,</hi> a godly and Religious Gentleman, who was Patron of the place, and lived in the Parish, presented Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>The Parish was very small, and the Ministers means of maintenance answerable, being not above 60 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> accepted of it, and laboured faithfully in the work of the Ministry, with much Evidence and demonstration of the Spirit and Power, so that many reforted to his Ministry from places adjacent, and Mr. <hi>Adderly</hi> took such a Love and liking to him, that he bestowed his Daughter upon him, who proved a loving and loyal Wife unto him all his days. <note place="margin">His Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Having continued some time at <hi>Weddington,</hi> there was another little Parish within less than a Mile of it, called <hi>Cawcot,</hi> which falling void by the death of the Incumbent, the <note place="margin">To <hi>Cawcot.</hi>
                  </note> Patron conferred that upon Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> also, because the Churches being but about half a Mile asunder, he might preach in the Morning at the one, and in the Afternoon at the other; or one <hi>Lords-day</hi> at one, and another at the other, yet the Profits of both did not amount to 100 <hi>l. per annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Parts and Pains were so conspicuous that they were not fit to be bounded within so narrow a compass, and therefore at the request of divers Friends, he undertook a Lecture <note place="margin">His Lecture at <hi>Nun-Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                  </note> at <hi>Nun-Eaton,</hi> a large Market-Town near unto him, and about seven Miles from <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> unto which multitudes resorted, both of the Gentry, Ministry, and private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whereof many came from places divers Miles off, as I my self was somtimes a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>There he continued till the Civil Wars brake forth, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1642. between the King and the Parliament, at which time, for his safety, he retired with his Family into <note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Coventry.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Coventry,</hi> as divers other Ministers did; and considering the heavy Judgments of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nation, and the great danger that they were in, they agreed amongst themselves to set up a Morning Lecture, which began at Seven, and ended about Eight a Clock, which they kept by turns, to the great Comfort and Edification of the Citizens, and others of the Gentry, that were retreated into the City. Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> was one that kept up this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and preached also somtimes on the <hi>Lords-days,</hi> with great approbation, and content to his Hearers.</p>
               <p>There he continued to the year 1643. at which time the <hi>Assembly of Divines</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <note place="margin">Chosen into the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> and he was chosen one of the Ministers for <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> and it was a Mercy to the Church of God that he was so: For how much good he did there about the matter of Church-Government, may safely be concealed, but scarcely be expressed without offence to some.</p>
               <p>This occasioned his coming to <hi>London,</hi> and soon after he was chosen to preach before the House of Commons on one of their solemn Fast-Days, which he performed with much <note place="margin">His coming to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> judgment, Masculine and Nervous Oratory, as may be seen in his Sermon, printed by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the said House: And he was taken so much notice of, that soon after he was chosen Minister of <hi>Clements Danes,</hi> a very large, and considerable Parish, wherein, besides Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, <note place="margin">To <hi>Clements Danes.</hi>
                  </note> there were some Nobles, and Persons of Eminency.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Essex-House</hi> being in that Parish, that Noble Earl was his frequent Hearer, with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62667:42"/> whose Ministry he was so pleased and taken, that he became his great Friend to his dying Day, and after his death Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> was made choice of to preach at his Funeral, which curious and ingenious Sermon is to be seen in Print. He was called often to preach before the Parliament, sometimes before the House of Lords, and sometimes before the House of Commons, all which he performed to the great Satisfaction of his Hearers, especially of the most judicious. And how effectual his Ministry in his own Parish was, some yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving can, and have testified, not without many Tears, being much troubled for the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of those Breasts, from which, for some years, they had such wholsom, pleasing, and profitable nourishment.</p>
               <p>After some time spent in that place, by the sollicitation, and procurement of the Earl of <hi>Essex, (Clements Danes</hi> being so large and unweildy a Parish) he was removed to the Rectory of <hi>Watton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford.</hi> The Parsonage was of good value, yet <note place="margin">His Remove to <hi>Watton.</hi>
                  </note> much over-rated in the common Report, (as most <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Living use to be;) but it proved small to him, by reason of his great Charges in repairing a ruinous House; great Taxes (the tenth of all which was laid upon him by his Neighbours, who knew not how to value such a Pearl,) and (as himself told me) being forced to find a Horse and Arms without any other joined with him: Besides, in regard of his necessary absence sometimes, he was fain to maintain an Assistant to supply his room.</p>
               <p>When the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> was reformed by the noble Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi> he was chosen, and appointed to be Master of <hi>Pembrook Hall:</hi> And sew there were more <note place="margin">To <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi>
                  </note> fit for Learning, or a Spirit of Government, and for such a trust than he. When he came to it, he found the House very empty of Students, and the Buildings much out of Order, by abuse of rude Soldiers that had been quartered in it: But the Fame of Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> now made Master, quickly drew Scholars; the Chambers were repaired, and made fit for their Entertainment, &amp; the House flourished with godly, and learned Fellows, and Scholars. There he continued, promoting Religion and Learning to the utmost of his Power, till he was put out for refusing the <hi>Engagement,</hi> even that <hi>Engagement,</hi> which, though some did swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yet to others it proved a stone of sttumbling, and a Rock of Offence to many other tender, Consciencious Heads of Houses, Fellows of Colledges, and Ministers in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>From being Pastor of <hi>Watton</hi> (a place too mean for his Gifts) he had a fair Invitation and Call to the Pastoral Charge of <hi>Lawrence Jury, London,</hi> and so he returned to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">To <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Jury.</hi>
                  </note> again, where he exercised his choice. Talents to Gods Glory, and the great good of his People, and others that flocked to his Ministry: And God so blessed his Labours, and gave him such room and Interest in the Hearts of his People, that whereas his House was old and incommodious, they pulled it down, built it new, and enlarged it out of their own Purses, which cost them (as I was informed) about Five Hundred Pounds.</p>
               <p>Whilest he was Minister there, he was chosen to be one of the weekly Lecturers at St. <hi>Michaels Cornhill,</hi> which Lecture was set up and maintained by some godly and well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Merchants, who frequented the same, together with multitudes of other Citizens, out of all parts of the City, and it was a means (through Gods Blessing) to edifie many, and to settle and establish others in those giddy times.</p>
               <p>As he was thus indefatigably spending himself, and labouring in the Lords Harvest work, it pleased God to afflict him with a great distemper, accompanied with much pain in his <note place="margin">His Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Head, which suddenly almost took his sight from him, insomuch (as himself told me, with whom I was intimately acquainted for about Fourteen years before his Death) that he could not see to read the largest Print, neither would any Spectacles help him. This occasioned a very great change; for whereas before he was of a lively, chearful, and active Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now he became dull, and Melancholly: whereas before he was of a strong, and healthful Constitution, now he became weak and crazy, yet would not be taken off from his Labours to the last; but was desirous to spend and be spent in the work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>On a <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day he preached his last Sermon, and administred the Holy Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> not finding any sensible change in himself, till about Ten a Clock at Night, when he was going to Bed, at which time he fell into a great Bleeding at the Nose, probably having over-heat his Blood by the labours of the Day; and having finished his course upon Earth, and faithfully discharged the Work and Errand for which God sent him into the World, between Two and Three a Clock that Night, he quietly and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly resigned up his Spirit unto God that gave it, and was honourably buried (multitudes <note place="margin">His Death.</note> attending his Corps to the Grave, with much Lamentation and Mourning) at <hi>Lawrence-Jury London, Feb.</hi> 7. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1655. and of his Age about Fifty Six: And from the Sanctification of the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> he went to his everlasting <hi>Rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62667:43"/>
               <p> He was (as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist)</hi> a <hi>burning and a shining Light: An Interpreter one of a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note>
                  <hi>Thousand:</hi> Of very great and eminent Parts: taller by the Head and Shoulders then most of his Brethren. A Man mighty in the Scriptures; Another <hi>Apollos</hi> in that; excellently and exquisitely accomplished in all parts of Learning. A perfect Master of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; a good <hi>Philologer;</hi> an excellent <hi>Orator.</hi> He was a ready and piercing <hi>Disputant,</hi> and so he approved himself even to admiration, in those two famous Treaties, the one at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> the other at <hi>Newport</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Wight;</hi> in both which places, being (with some other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines) appointed to attend their Commissioners sent from the Parliament, in the former Place to treat with the Kings Commissioners, and in the latter with the King himself, he strenuously enervated the Arguments of those, who asserted the <hi>Divine Right of Prelacy,</hi> and assertest the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>He was a solid and judicious Divine, who read much, and concocted what he read; One who was able to give a weighty and pithy Decision in any controverted point: He was a notable confuter of Errours, he seldom spake to them, but hit the Bird in the Eye, and made him die, not a lingring, but a sudden Death. In the course of his Ministry he was highly <hi>Orthodox,</hi> sound in the Faith, very powerful, very spiritual; His whole design and drift in his Ministry was to clear up that great Doctrine of Justification (in which he was eminently, and throughly studied) to debase Mans Righteousnes, and to exalt the Righteousness of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> He was one that knew how to speak a word in season to wounded and bruised Spirits. There was a great <hi>Light,</hi> who is now with God, Mr. <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Grantham,</hi> who, being under a sore and grievous Desertion, did receive much Comfort by discourse with him.</p>
               <p>His diligence in his Work and Calling was great in Labours much, in Preaching much, <note place="margin">His Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</note> and towards his end his great weakness neither did, nor could hinder him from his Masters Work, with St. <hi>Austin,</hi> he desired, that when <hi>Christ</hi> should come, he might find him <hi>aut Precantem, aut Praedicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m;</hi> Either Praying or Preaching. That which would have made some to keep their Beds, could not keep him out of the Pulpit. And as he Preached, so he lived, By his Parts he did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; By his Grace he did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: What he Preached to others he practiced himself, and was not like a <hi>Mercurial Post,</hi> that directs the way to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but never stirs it self.</p>
               <p>For his natural temper, he was a Man of a Heroical and undaunted Spirit, some called <note place="margin">Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</note> him <hi>Luther,</hi> not being much unlike him (as it should seem by his Picture) and indeed he was another <hi>Luther;</hi> he feared not the Faces of any in the discharging of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In his Deportment he was somewhat blunt and inobservant, yet not in the least Proud, or morose, and supercilious. Two things were objected against him by some: First, his frequent removes from place to place, towards his latter end; And secondly, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, which they inferred from the former. But their is no question but that a Minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may have just and lawful occasion of removing from one place to another, especially in such unsetled times as those were (yet it is confessed that, for the avoyding of Offence, they should be very wary and circumspect therein) but for his particular case, after he had long continued in his Pastoral charge in the Country (tho the Place was obscure, and the means small) in all his latter removes, he can scarce be said to have undertaken a Pastoral Charge in any of them, except in the last of <hi>Laurence Jury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the charge of Covetousness, I remember that Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> had the same aspertion <note place="margin">Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> cast upon him, but his last Testament shewed that he dyed a very poor Man: For all his Goods, yea and his Library, being sold very dear (saith Mr. <hi>Beza)</hi> scarcely amounted to three Hundred Crowns. And Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himself in his life time, hearing of this impudent slander, answered, <hi>If I cannot persuademen whilst I am alive to believe that I am no great Monyed Man, yet my Death will shew it.</hi> And the Senate at <hi>Geneva</hi> could testify that his stipend being very small, he was so far from not being contented with it, that when they offered to enlarge his Pensions, he utterly refused the same: By this small estate which he left at his Death, it appeared that either his Gifts were not great, or else that he spent as God sent: So Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> by what he left at his death; made it abundantly appear, that his Heart was not much set upon the World; For if it had, sure there would have been more of the World in his Purse: for it may be confidently affirmed, that their was not a Minister of any repute in the City of <hi>London,</hi> for some years, that died with so small an Estate as Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> did.</p>
               <p>If we take him as a Christian, he was another <hi>Enoch,</hi> a true Walker with God, a very Holy Man: more cannot be said of any Man; less cannot be said of him, without wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his his memory. His Life was like <hi>Enochs</hi> Life, and his Death was like <hi>Enochs Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for he died suddenly. He went to Bed, slept, and dyed. His Death was a sleep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62667:43"/> Being weary and spent with his Work, God took him to Heaven, there to give him a Cordial: From the Pulpit he went to the Throne: As soon as he had ended his <hi>Sabbath</hi> here, he entred upon his everlasting <hi>Sabbath</hi> in Glory. He went warm from his Work to his Wages. That's blessed thing for a Minister to be found by Death about his Lords business. Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> his work was done, he was weary and feeble, and God his good Master took him to himself, crowned him with Life and Immortality, and instead of hard Labour here, called him to that joyful work of singing forth Praises and <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to his God and Father.</p>

                     <hi>Let us also hear what Mr.</hi> Simeon Ash, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Edmund Calamy <hi>have left upon Record concerning Mr.</hi> Vines.</head>
                  <p>IT hath been (say they) no small Grief unto us, that so many Faithful, Fruitful, Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Ministers, eminent both for Learning and Piety, have been of late removed from us, now in the time when we have most need of their Counsel, Preaching, and Prayers, for our present healing, and the preventing of our future feared dangers.</p>
                  <p>Oh! How sad a sight is it to behold our Pilots, our Steersmen, lying dead upon the Deck, when the Winds rise, the Seas swell, the Clouds blacken, and the Heavens lowre, presaging approaching Storms? How awakening a Providence is this, to have our Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters beaten up, and at the same time to see our Captain, and Standard-Bearers laid lifeless in the Dust? We cannot without Sorrow remember the Death of many of our Worthies, whose signal Characters of deserved Commendations have already been made publick for the use of succeeding Ages: And this our late blow received in the removal of famous Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> doth cause our former Wounds to bleed afresh.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> his natural <hi>Acumen,</hi> together with acquired Abilities were extraordinary. He <note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> was a smart Disputant, as it was observed in many places with admiration; Not only in the <hi>Assembly of Divines</hi> against Diffenting Brethren, but likewise at the Conferences at <hi>Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> about the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of Prelacy, where some of his learned Opposites were very sensible of his strength.</p>
                  <p>He was a well studied Orthodox Divine, his Ministry was solid, pithy, nervous, quick, and searching, as his most judicious Auditors, both in <hi>Warwickshire, Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> will acknowledg. His Sermon preached at the Funeral of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> doth prove him to have been an excellent <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> and an eloquent <hi>Orator.</hi> The Sermons which he preached before both Houses of Parliament, do not only discover his high parts, but do tell the World, that he was neither a Flatterer, nor a Time-server.</p>
                  <p>As he had a clear Head, and could dive deep into a knotty Controversie, so he had <hi>(Luther-</hi>like) an undaunted Spirit, and was not afraid of Men, but could and would speak his Mind in any Company, with brave Mettal, and high Magnanimity. The great design of his Ministry (especially towards his latter end) was to drive Man out of himself, and to draw him unto Christ; to discover the cheats of Mans deceitful Heart, and to throw down all sandy Foundations of Hope of Heaven, to encourage an humble dependance upon the Lord Jesus Christ; as also to quicken inside Holiness with the Power of Godliness in a Christian Conversation.</p>
                  <p>And (that which was the Crown of all other his Excellencies) he was a man of a right, gracious, and tender Spirit, whereof this was an evident Demonstration, (to instance in no more) that he resolved rather to suffer, by being turned out of the Mastership of <hi>Pembrook-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> than to subscribe the <hi>Engagement</hi> against his Conscience: Yea, he was (out of Knowledge) an hearty <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> notwithstanding the manifold discouragements, which were from every hand, cast upon that way of God, in those wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and declining times.</p>
                  <p>Now upon the Death of this worthy man, our much endeared Brother, our words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sufficiently express the grief of our Hearts. And to move others to mourning for such a loss, (besides sundry other Arguments which we will not mention) we may truly apply some of the passages of <hi>David</hi>'s Lamentation over <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.) <hi>Weep over</hi> Saul, <hi>who cloathed you with Scarlet, with other delights; who p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Now this Champion; This Prince of Preachers is laid silent in the Dust (with many other of our Reverend deceased Brethren) never any more to awaken, to warm, to encourage, and to edifie our Souls by his Ministerial Endeavours.</p>

                     <l>Could wish that all the <hi>Levites</hi> of this Age</l>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Mr.</hi> Richard Blackerby, <hi>who died</hi> Anno Christi, 1648.</head>
               <p>THat eminently holy Divine Mr. <hi>Richard Blackerby,</hi> was born in the <note place="margin">His Birth, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> year 1574. at <hi>Worlington</hi> in <hi>Suffolk.</hi> He was second Son of <hi>Thomas Blackerby,</hi> a person of good Estate and Quality, whose Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew (the Worshipful <hi>Thomas Blackerby</hi> Esquire) was lately one of the Aldermen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and afterward high Sheriff of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and is yet living a Justice of Peace in that County; being Honoured by all men for his eminent Service to God and his Country, in all his publick stations; <hi>Richards</hi> Father had nine Sons and one Daughter; unto all whom he gave Pious Education: who designed his second Son (from the first) for the Ministry, and first put him to the School of St. <hi>Edmundsbury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> where he profited so much, that at the Age of Fifteen years he was admitted a Student in Trinity-Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he lived nine years, and became an eminent Scholar in all parts of Learning, especially in his great skill in the Hebrew, Greek and Latine Tongues, being reckoned one of the best <hi>Hebritians</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> in those days.</p>
               <p>While he was in the University, famous Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> was a Preacher and Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in the Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> upon whose Ministry he diligently attended; <note place="margin">He is first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of sin by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of Mr. <hi>Perkins.</hi>
                  </note> whereby his Soul (when he was middle Batchelour of Arts) was deeply wrought upon, and truly converted, but he lay some years in great distress of Conscience, and much perplexity of Spirit, when his Father took him for some time home to <hi>Worlington,</hi> to see if change of Air might a little relieve him in his Melancholy, which his Friends thought proceeded from temper of body, though it had another cause, which neither Air nor Company could remove.</p>
               <p>After a short time, he desired to return again to Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> for satisfaction of Soul, and it pleased God (as he was returning to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Riding alone upon <hi>New-market</hi> Heath, bemoaning his sad condition before the Lord) to reveal his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62667:47"/> reconciled face in Christ Jesus to him, and to give him that Peace of Conscience (so well grounded, and so clearly evidenced) that he never lost it to his dying day.</p>
               <p>From the University he went and lived first in the nature of a Chaplain in the House of Sir <hi>Thomas Jermin</hi> of <hi>Rushbrook</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who was Father of the present Earl of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> in which Family he both Morning and Evening, not only prayed, but opened some Portion of Scripture, during the whole time of his abode there.</p>
               <p>From thence he removed to live with the Renowned and Pious Knight, Sir <note place="margin">Then with Sir <hi>Edward Lewk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> at <hi>Denham,</hi> where he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Daughter of a Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</note>
                  <hi>Edward Lewknor</hi> of <hi>Denham</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> (great Grandfather to the Right Honourable and Virtuous, the late Lady <hi>Townsend)</hi> with whom he lived till he married <hi>Sarah,</hi> the eldest Daughter of Mr. <hi>Timothy Prick,</hi> alias <hi>Oldman;</hi> which <hi>alias Oldman</hi> was assumed to the Family in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Father of the said <hi>Timothy,</hi> being forced then to abscond, and to change his name, being persecuted for the Protestant Religion.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Blackerby</hi> lived two years with his Reverend Father-in-Law, Minister of <note place="margin">He was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Living of <hi>Feltwell</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> but seats himself at <hi>Ashen</hi> in <hi>Essex.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Denham,</hi> and from thence was called to be Minister at <hi>Feltwell</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> where he continued without Institution or Induction for some time, but then by reason of his Non-conformity, he was forced to remove, and hired a House at <hi>Ashen,</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in <hi>Essex</hi> near <hi>Clare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, not being capable to receive any Ecclesiastical Preferment upon the account aforesaid, he betook himself to the way of Boarding young men, and Educating of Youth, spending three and twenty years in that imployment in part; for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time, he almost constantly kept Lectures in some Neighbouring Town, Preaching weekly in one place or other; and for the last ten years of the forementioned time, he Preached statedly either at <hi>Castle Heningham, Stoke</hi> by <hi>Clare,</hi> or <hi>Hunden</hi> in <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the way of his life, he seemed never to lose one moment of time in idleness, <note place="margin">His general course of life.</note> or non-improvement thereof; and herein is wrapt up even all the practical wisdom of mortal man, <hi>viz.</hi> to improve time for immortality. He rose early in the Morning Winter and Summer, and spent the whole day in Reading, Meditation, Prayer, and teaching of others. After a competent time spent in his Study in the Morning, he would early call his Family (or any other Family in which he was, and wherein he had any influence) together, and as constantly as the Sun rose and set, he failed not Morning and Evening to spend some time in Reading and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding some part of the Scripture and Prayer, unless in very extraordinary cases; and not being capable of a Benefice, because he could not subscribe, he spent much of his time in teaching young Schollars, Boarding in his House always a great number of youths, the Sons of Pious Gentry, Tradesmen, and Yeomen in the Country, whom he daily instructed both in Religion and Learning. They sate round about the Table at his Expositions; and if he saw any behaving themselves as not minding, he would call out to that Youth by name, and ask him what he had said last; by which means he made them continually attentive.</p>
               <p>He was a great Walker, and, like the old Peripateticks, he would oft call forth <note place="margin">He Educated and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted many persons after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Famous in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note> his Scholars abroad, and teach them both Natural and Divine knowledge; fitting some for the University, and others for other Callings. He walked continually before them, as the Picture of Jesus among his Disciples, abounding in Wisdom, Heavenliness and Love. Many grew to be excellent persons in Church and State; and indeed, his example was enough to commend Religion to the Head and Heart of every spectator. The observance of his Life did seem immediately to dash all thoughts of Atheism and Irreligion, whenever they arose in the hearts of any spectatators, it was the saying of some of his Scholars, that they were as satisfied that he lived in the virtue of a Divine and holy principle, as that they did ever see men walking on Earth by virtue of a living Soul within. Divers young Students (after they came from the University) betook themselves to him to prepare them for the Ministry, whom he taught the Hebrew Tongue, to whom he opened the Scriptures, and read Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and gave them excellent advice for Learning, Doctrine and Life; and many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent persons proceeded from this <hi>Gamaliel;</hi> as Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> afterwards Dean and Bishop in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom he commended to Archbishop <hi>Ʋsher,</hi> with whom he had great acquaintance; Mr. <hi>Prosse</hi> Minister of two <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregations, first in <hi>Colchester,</hi> then in <hi>London;</hi> Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> afterwards famous in <hi>New England;</hi> holy and learned Mr. <hi>Fairclough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burrel,</hi> and many others.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:62667:47"/>
               <p> He was a man much in Prayer, much in Closet Prayer, much in walking Prayer, <note place="margin">Much in Prayer.</note> much in solitary Prayer by himself; much in conjugal Prayer (for he daily prayed with his Wife alone) much in Family Prayer; daily with his own Family, and almost daily with some other Family; very much in Fasting and Prayer; for which he took all occasions that seemed in any measure to require it.</p>
               <p>The instructing of his Family, and teaching youth, took him not off from his <note place="margin">The way of his publick Ministry.</note> publick Ministry: for though he could never have a Benefice, yet he usually Preached some Lecture in some Neighbouring place, as hath been told; and he also Preached frequently occasional Sermons. If he were suspended in one County, he would go and Preach in another; for his Habitation was near to two or three several Counties; he used much to Ride about from Family to Family (when pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly he could be spared from his Scholars) and only alight and pray with them, and give them some heavenly exhortation, and then away to another Family. And in the next Neighbourhood to his House, where he could walk, he would frequently visit those near Inhabitants, especially the Poor, painfully instructing them, and fervently praying with them; and would give them Catechisms and Bibles, and money, if he had it, and they had need of it; by which his going about and doing good, many backs and bellies praised God in time, and more Souls will to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>His Preaching was not altogether in the usual manner, but much in opening the <note place="margin">The manner of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Scripture, and making excellent, spiritual, short observations, and brief and close Applications. He had great skill in the Original Tongues, spent much Study to understand the Scripture, and lived much in Divine Converse; by all which he became a singular Textuary, and famous Divines would frequently send to him for his Opinion in Scripture difficulties. He was a mighty man in wounding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences by the Sword of the Spirit, and in healing them by the Blood of Jesus. His Voice used not to be very loud, but his Preaching was accompanied with such an Authority of the Divine presence and power of the Spirit, that Souls fell exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly under the Yoke of Christ by his Ministry; so that he has (being urged by some reasons thereto) been constrained to acknowledge to some intimate Friends, (though far from boasting) that he had reason to believe, that God had made him a Spiritual Father to above two Thousand persons. Indeed the Word of God in his Lips was so unmixt with any appearance of any self, or by-respects, and came so pure, as it were immediately from the Holy Ghost, that like the Word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>it was very quick and powerful,</hi> and men soon became, either Converts to it, or flyers from it; or with all their might fighters against it; The direct rays of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light falling on the Conscience, will have a speedy and great effect; When 'tis mingled and diluted with a Carnal Spirit, or not directly levelled at the heart, it may fall, many years, upon the outward Ear, and may sometimes affect men, but never a piercing drop doth enter the Soul; or if it does, it is quickly choaked there, with the body of death and power of darkness; but his Preaching was such as must be yielded to, fled from, or fought against. Many prophane persons that could both hear other Pious Ministers, and would curse them bitterly when they had done; yet dared neither to hear him, or speak against him if they did. There was so much of God in him and with him, that he left a perpetual dread upon many Souls that would play with others Sermons, and with their names and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Multitudes of very prophane persons did fall under the power of the Word Preached by him; a particular instance whereof, happened in or near <hi>Castle He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> where a Society or Club of young persons, (who used to have their set times to meet, and dance, and frolick it in their youthful sports, sins and vanities) were by his Preaching there, all or most of them converted, and became a company of gracious Christians, and used afterwards to joyn in Prayer, as before they had done in sin and folly.</p>
               <p>Some whose Consciences were scared, would sometimes rise up against his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on his Persecutors.</note> with rage and violence; but the Wrath of God did often most eminently take hold of such. As in <hi>Hunden</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> where sometime he had a Lecture, he met with great opposition; divers persons of considerable Estate in the Town, joyned together, ond procured his suspension; but all of them were notoriously after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, blasted in their outward Estates; some brought to beggery, and all but one died miserably: One of them the next Lords-day after his Suspension, boasting in the Church-yard, That now they had got <hi>Blackerby</hi> out of the Pulpit; to which,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62667:48"/> a Woman standing by and hearing, replyed, <hi>Blackerby</hi> will Preach again in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Pulpit, when you are crying in Hell; and that very day eight years that man was buried, and the Lords-day after, Mr. <hi>Blackerby</hi> had liberty to Preach again, and Preached in <hi>Hunden</hi> Pulpit.</p>
               <p>The particular acts of his great Religion, the little Piety of the next, and this <note place="margin">The eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> present Age, have suffered many of them to slip out of their memories, and have been much wanting as to the copying of them out in their Lives and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but there was yet never any person who had the happiness to converse with him (and some of them are yet living) who did not behold both his Heart and Life, so greatly sanctified, and so generally raised, to such an universality and heighth of true Christian Godliness, as cannot be equalized. Few persons have ever been acquainted with, or scarce ever read or heard of any meer man, that did exceed him, though others might equal him in some corporal severities, and seem more heated in some particular parts of Religion or Obedience, yet for the impartiality, constancy and sweetness of Holiness, very few have came near him, and none since the Primitive times did excel him. He (in good earnest) made it his business to live with God, and to his Glory, not as it is to be feared of too many Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, that they satisfie themselves in the frequent motions of their affections in some pangs of indigested resolutions, or some fits of Pious Conversation, as if these were the Life and Power of Godliness, all which are very good and desireable; but yet at best, they are but some seeds and blossoms of the Divine Nature, which is first conceived by the Holy Ghost in the Soul, in a real absolute Consecration of the whole Man to God, and grows in a diligent endeavour of perfect Conformity to this Consecration. He, the business of whose Heart and Life is not in all things (fetching strength from Christ by Faith, who is the careful and faithful Head of his Church) to live to God, is yet no living Child of God, what preparatories soever there may be in him towards it. It would make ones heart tremble to think what multitudes of half Christians drop daily down into everlasting destruction, cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves with pious sentiments, as if they were the life of Godliness, which cannot be but in an absolute Union with Christ, and living in the virtue of him, and faithful Obedience to him, as this Saint did. He lived not without infirmities, but in the eye of all knowing, impartial, daily spectators, he was free from the allowance of himself in any sinful act in the World, and without the visible acting of any sin of Commission, not so much as speaking of an idle, or an angry word (but in reproving of that which he accounted sin) or losing any moment of time that he could redeem, or that he was sensible he might better spend; and this by the space of above forty years, as by diligent inquiry, and personal acquaintance of many years, will be justified. His deportment was always such, as if at that moment he saw God, and had Gods Law, his own Covenant with God, and the day of account just then before his eye, so that whenever the Lord should come and call him, he would ever have been found so doing. To any understanding converser with him, there always appeared wrote in his face and demeanour, A sense of the Divine Majesty and Holiness a most pleasing consciencious, and full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of himself to God, a watchfulness upon his own Heart and Life, least he should offend; a great mortification of heart to all the World; a wonderful pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from sinful pollution; and an admirable transformation of Spirit unto the Divine similitude and converse. Indeed, constant Holiness seemed perfectly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him, when it seems but laboured and endeavoured after by others. That he sinned, his conversers knew not, but by; First, the infinite due of God, and perfection of his Law, to which no depraved Son or Daughter of fallen man can (in his affections and operations) be adequate or exactly correspondent. Secondly, by some mistakes that some might apprehend in his Judgment in some disputable things. Thirdly, by the great complaints usually made of the Plague of his Heart.</p>
               <p>For with this heighth of Holiness was joyned the depth of Humility. He has <note place="margin">Great Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> sometimes, walking with his eldest Grand-child, then but a youth, took occasion to say (after other serious discourse) Oh Lad! thou little thinkest what a vile heart I have, how I am plagued with proud thoughts; Child (if thou hast acquaintance with God in Prayer) pray for me, that God would purifie this filthy heart; oh! if God did not enable me in some measure to keep a watch over it, I should act to the shame of my face; which expressions did greatly affect the heart of this young
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62667:48"/> person, to hear one who lived so like an incarnate Angel, to speak at such a rate of his heart; to hear so grave on Apostle, who never used to speak unbecoming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so talk to one but a youth, and his Grand-child.</p>
               <p>And such discourses as these were frequent with him to other persons, when a fitting season offered it self. He seemed to have small sense of any self-excellency, though Satan would sain have defiled him with it (but he walked in continual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the vouchsafements of free Grace unto him) from his Humility came that readiness in him to be perswaded or disposed of by others, much inferiour to him, in any thing (so Religion and Duty suffer not by it) little valuing in what place he was put, or what account was had of him, so he might keep close to his Duty, and enjoy the Light of the Divine Countenance.</p>
               <p>And that which did set him most high above all others who lived in these later <note place="margin">The impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Conscience.</note> days, was the most impartial universality of his Obedience, joyned with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Charity and Candour to all others, wherein was the least appearance of good. No hopes of preferment, or smart of suffering, could prevail with him to depart from his Light; he could not so conform to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the Law required, to make him capable of a Living, or secure from the punishment of some Laws; yet wherein he thought it his Duty, or becoming Religion to Conform, no man more exact than he.</p>
               <p>And therefore being no Enemy to the greatest part of the Common Prayer, he would all days, Lords-days and Week-days, when Divine Service was read in the Parish-Church, go with his Family to the very beginning, and there behave himself with that Reverence and Heavenliness, as I never saw any like him therein.</p>
               <p>That Religion will never stand before God, that by Zeal in some things thinks to purchase Liberty for transgression in others. It is a single eye that will reach Heaven, that aims only at Divine pleasure wherever he finds it; all the Will of God is amiable to it, unmingled with by ends or selfish concernments. Its true, circumstances of things may impose or discharge from the actual performance of positive commands; that act may be a Duty to day, and to this man, that all things considered, will be a sin to morrow, and to another person; and the heart may have a single eye, when that of the understanding may have a cloud of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes upon it; but integrity impartially inquires, chearfully embraces, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently pursues all Gods revealed pleasure.</p>
               <p>And there is nothing more contrary to the Law of Christ, to the Eye of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <note place="margin">His candid and charitable Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> and to the Nature of the Gospel, than to set my self down in an Infallible Chair, and pass sentence on the Light and Truth, Knowledge and Grace of all others, by the measure of my own sentiments; herein Pride, Folly and Cruelty are come to the heighth, when I would be a Prince, and judge not only over mens acts, but their heads and hearts, as though I were not fallible and corrupt as well as any of them. Blessed be God, who will in Christ accept of mens faithfulness to their Light, though their Neighbours see it not. This Saint was so far from the crime of censuring, that if any fault were visible in him, it was that of excessive Charity to all others, in whom there was the least appearance to him of good, which charitable credulity of his, some persons did abuse; with which, when he has sometimes been charged, he would usually repeat a saying of his Father in Christ, famous Mr. <hi>Perkins;</hi> That when a man is once acquainted with his own heart, he will be apt to think every one better than himself; an appearance of the love of God in any, would make him put the best construction on all their words and acts.</p>
               <p>But he was as far from countenancing any known evil in any: I believe none that <note place="margin">His faithful, kind and wise reproving.</note> ever conversed with him, but will bare him witness, that he never suffered, what he thought sin in them, without admonition and reproof; as sure as he observed the evil, they should hear of it from him; but ever with so much evident love as well as seriousness, that at the same time, both their Consciences were awed by the gravity of his advice, and their Affections inflamed with the sweetness of his Spirit. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs were truly, as one well expresses, Nailes dipt in Oil, driven with power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inmost of the heart, and received with all acceptation, because of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming kindness they were accompanied with. Most mens reproofs by pride, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or imprudence, bar the door against their own entertainment; but his Sun would woo away mens evil, when others violent Storms make them in rage hold
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62667:49"/> it faster. When he has been in company, and heard great persons swear, or speak prophanely; he would with a sad Countenance (leaving the Table, or departing the Room) rebuke, and afterward privately address the great Person with so much seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and respect, that they would be much taken with his dealing with them, greatly thank him for his reproof, and the manner of it; and one told him, had you spoke to me at Table, I had stabb'd you, but now I heartily thank you. He would neither suffer sin in men unreproved, nor provoke to sin by his rebuke.</p>
               <p>He was very zealous for the holy observation of the Lords-day. On <hi>Saturday</hi> at <note place="margin">Sanctification of the Lords-day.</note> four in the Afternoon, he constantly Preached in his Family, (to which divers Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours would resort) preparatory for the next day. Of all Mornings, he would rise most early on the Lords-day Mornings; and wherever he was, and had any power, would call up all the Family, but especially his own, to Prayer and Reading. He usually prayed six times every Lords-day in the Family. First, as soon as he had got them up in the Morning, expounding some part of the Scripture to them. Secondly, when he was going to the publick Congregation, he carried his Family with him, and before they went out of door, would pour out some Petitions for Gods assistance and blessing in the publick Worship of the day. Thirdly, when he returned again from Church in the Morning, he constantly prayed for a blessing on what they had heard. Fourthly, he led them out again in the Afternoon with Prayer. Fifthly, a while after they were returned in the Afternoon, the Sermons were repeated, the Family examined what they remembred; which they concluded with Prayer. Sixthly, after Supper, when the Family was ready to go to Bed, he commended them again to God by Prayer. But this must be observed, he prayed oft, but never (unless upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occasion) very long, neither Lords-days nor Week-days, at home or abroad, in Family or Congregation; nor in Preaching, would he ever be tedious or over-long; but the graciousness of his Spirit in the Ordinance, brought a peculiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light with it to all that joyned with him, and had any love to their God or Souls; so that his Exercises (though frequent) were never burdensome. On the Lords-day he was impatient to hear any idle word, or see any idle action, nor could he endure any worldly word or act, but what was of Charity or Necessity; but after Dinner he would call upon all, especially those that were apt to sleep at Church, to go and take a Nap, as he himself usually did, least they should prophane Gods publick Worship, or should hazard the salvation or edification of their immortal Souls, by sleeping in the Congregation; and therefore also he frequently inveighed against great Dinners on the Lords-day, as apt to make them heavy and dull on those glorious days, set apart for celebration of Divine praises, and edification of mens precious Souls. At a place called <hi>Linton</hi> in <hi>Cambridge-shire,</hi> there was a Fair usually kept on the Lords-day once a year; at which time he was once invited to Preach, and he then so plainly convinced the Town of the greatness of the sin, and evil of it, that they would never more keep the Fair on the Lords-day. Though he lived every day as sinless, and as heavenly as if it had been a Sabbath, yet he was very sensible, that our time is then much more to be spent in outward Religious Exercises, than on other days. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of his Life, was all the Week to Obey, Glorifie, and have Communion with God; but on the Lords-day, the object of his acts was all Religious or Charitable performances.</p>
               <p>He was much free from the stone in the heart, a man of a most tender and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite <note place="margin">His tender frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> Spirit. Any (greater than the most common) sins or providences, made deep impressions on him; if any such sin were committed in a Neighbour Town, or any Judgment fell out in the Vicinage, or in the Nation, he would be sure to get di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ministers and Christians together, and keep a day of Fasting and Prayer. In Nights of great Thunder and unusual Tempest, he would call up all his Family to Prayer, and expound some part of the Scripture to them, to affect their hearts with greater Reverence towards God. Any notable Scripture, any eminent Providence deeply entered his Soul, and raised up his Graces into act.</p>
               <p>As his Life was ever led as in the Divine presence, so his Heart and Tongue were <note place="margin">His readiness for, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Gods Ordinances.</note> ever ready for Prayer, or any holy Duty; and he so enjoyed God in every Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exercise, that he would almost constantly say when he rose up from Prayer, or came from a Sermon, or any holy Converse, or any Religious Exercise (especially a day of Fasting and Prayer) that he must bless God for ever for such an Ordinance, and would not for many worlds, but have been in it; a frequent expression with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62667:49"/> him, and if an Hyperbole, the only one that he observed to use; but this worlds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights were so small, and Heavens so dear to him, that we might believe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression to be a truth (in the very Grammatical sense) and spoken from his heart.</p>
               <p>When he awaked in the Night, he was ever in Meditation or Prayer <note place="margin">His Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakings.</note> he would oft at Midnight, make <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> or <hi>English</hi> Verses, exalting the Praise of God, his Attributes, the Acts of Christ, or the Graces of his Spirit, or the like, and give them in the Morning to his Scholars.</p>
               <p>His Dreams were usually such, as shewed a heart that lived with God, full <note place="margin">His Dreams.</note> of gracious Communications from God to him, and of Faith, Love and Obedience to God, and in abhorrence of sin; and he would in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing usually pray, that his Dreams might be holy; and usually holy Dreams are certain signs of much love from God, or gracious habits in the man.</p>
               <p>He oft received immediate answers of Prayer. I heard an eminent Divine <note place="margin">Answers to his Prayer.</note> once say, he knew Eighteen Persecutors taken away remarkably upon his Fasting and Prayer. God seemed also to make a covenant for him with the Beasts of the Field: His Daughter <hi>Burrel</hi> was much affected with a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Providence, which happened to him when she was waiting on him one day, to visit one afflicted in Conscience; and their way lying through a Field where was a raging Bull, that used to do much mischief; which Beast seeing them, made towards them with great Fury; and being come very near them, he put off his Hat, and prayed in these words, <hi>Lord, if our way be of thee, stay the Fury of this Beast;</hi> which immediately stopt its way, and Roaring, turned from them. They that believe our Saviour, who saith, <hi>Not a hair of our Head, or a Bird in the Air, falls to the Ground but by the Councel of Providence,</hi> will think she had cause to be affected with this mercy.</p>
               <p>He kept three Diaries of his Life, one in <hi>Greek,</hi> another in <hi>Latin,</hi> a third <note place="margin">His Diaries.</note> in <hi>English,</hi> where he set down all the remarkable acts of God towards him, and of himself towards God; and had not those some way or other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, (it is supposed by a Fire that burned down the House where he lived not long before his death) we had not been so barren of memorable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his Life, as now we are; these he would oft read over to affect his Soul, and improve them to Divine Glory.</p>
               <p>His heart was as <hi>Pauls,</hi> so crucified to the World, and the World to him, <note place="margin">Mortification of inordinate affection.</note> that all Worldly concernments seemed a perfect nothing to him; (but where Duty obliged him) the World seemed to have no temptation to him, and he no taste for the World. His Passions were so much subdued, that though he was one that was most tenderly affected to his Relations, yet their loss discomposed not his Mind, interrupted not his Communion with God. His eldest Daughter was a most excellent person, and one in whom he took great delight; who died a few hours after her last Child was born, and he being present at her death, commended her Spirit to God more affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but as undisturbedly, as when he gave her Person to her Husband in Marriage. He desired to Preach her Funeral Sermon, which he did; and therein gave her this Testimony, That he believed she had feared the Lord in sincerity, from three years old; yet Preached so, as shewed he had not lost his God, though he had lost his dearest Child. Nothing of Creatures could in the least draw him from his Life with God.</p>
               <p>Living much in Divine Communion, he had great insight into Scripture <note place="margin">His Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirit.</note> Prophesies, and had many future events deeply imprest on his Mind. Men know but little of Gods Mind, because they live but little in his Presence and Converse. He was one of the first that convinced men in those parts,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62667:50"/> of Gods intent to convert the Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Famous Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stephen Marshall,</hi> and divers others, much opposed that Opinion at first, but were at last (by his Discourses) fully satisfied, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perswaded of the truth of it. He lived much in the foresight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the Glory and Peace of the Church in the last Ages of the World. He oft said (many years before it came to pass) to divers of his Friends, that they would, (and he believed himself should) live to see never a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting Bishop in power in <hi>England;</hi> and so he did. The first time when the <hi>Scots</hi> Army came into <hi>England,</hi> in the beginning of our late Troubles, he said to some that were much troubled for it, That that Army should go back again without a stroke struck; and so they did. He said after the Battle of <hi>Naseby,</hi> that many strict Professors of Religion should have rest for a little time; but afterwards a blacker time would come unto them than ever they had; which was in part fulfilled: but he used to add, the Storm would not last very long. And these were his very last words which he spake at his Death, uttered to his Daughter <hi>Burrell,</hi> a little before he breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his last; There is a sharp Storm coming, but it will be but short; the former part is in a considerable measure already proved true, God grant that (in the fulness of Gods time) the other part may also be accomplished, though the wretched decay of powerful Godliness among us may lengthen the Furrows on Professors backs, and put good things farther from them.</p>
               <p>He used to say, God had two Sieves for the Professors in <hi>England,</hi> one of a courser make, and that he had used; but there would come a finer one, which all should stand ready for; and this its doubted, is in a great degree to come. He used to say, That it was very probable this Nation would be punished by the <hi>French,</hi> after whose Fancies they went so much a Whoring. And he much believed Popery would come in, but it would not last; for it could not recover its first strength again in <hi>England;</hi> which last part of the Prophesie I pray God fulfil.</p>
               <p>He expressed at his death, great hopes which he had, that there would <note place="margin">His hopes of his Posterity.</note> be found many hundreds proceeding out of his Loins, standing at the last day at Christs Right Hand; and in all Charity, every one that have known them, must believe, that all his own Children were Heirs of Eternal Life; and there are great hopes of all his Grand-children, divers of whom are eminent and gracious persons; and some (of his fourth Generation) of his great Grand-children appear already most Consciencious and serious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>There were some particularities in him that may seem of lesser moment, but of good remarque. He could not endure to see any Bible lye contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously <note place="margin">Some things were peculiar in him.</note> about the House; but would have them carefully and cleanly used, or laid up; he thought there ought a negative Reverence to be given to the out-sides of such sacred Oracles.</p>
               <p>He was exceeding careful to have none of Gods Creatures lost; he would always have a Fowl or two allowed to come familiarly into his Eating Room, to pick up the lesser Crumbs that would fall from the Table.</p>
               <p>He was a great Enemy to vain Fashions, and in particular, to over long Hair; and would oft intimate, that excess of Apparel shewed great vanity of mind, and too great Conformity to the World; and it would be a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of much wrath from God; had he lived to see the mighty Towers and Mountains of Hair upon professing Men and Womens Heads, with the present decay of Piety, and the dreadful imminent Judgments, he would have greatly lamented it. Oh what amazement of Soul would he have been in, had he lived to see the Professors Garbes (in the best Congregations of Men) in the days wherein we live.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62667:50"/>
               <p> His Conversation was so in Heaven, and the Majesty of Holiness did so shine <note place="margin">The awe his presence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</note> in him, that that most famous Divine for Learning and Piety, Mr. <hi>Daniel Rogers</hi> of <hi>Wethersfield</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> told another Divine, that he could never come into the presence of Mr. <hi>Blackerby</hi> without some kind of trembling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; because of the Divine Majesty and Holiness which seemed to shine in him.</p>
               <p>The heighth and constancy of his holy and heavenly Converse was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a setled peace of Conscience, and good assurance of Eternal Life; <note place="margin">His constant and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> for some years before his death, he would oft (upon seasonable occasions) declare, that for more than forty years he never had a doubting thought of his Salvation. It is our low, loose, unequal walking in Religion, that makes the sense of Gods love, peace with God, and evidence for Eternal Life, so rare a thing among us; Religion lying for the most part so weak among Professors, as if it were in a Swoon, no wonder if it be oft esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dead. A Summer glorious Noon-tide, abundantly shews the Sun to be up; but how can they that live far from God, behold the Smiles of his Face, or hear the Whispers of his Voice.</p>
               <p>This holy Man was indeed an instance sent by God into the World, to shew <note place="margin">A living pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Piety.</note> to what Life of Holiness and Peace, Christians may on Earth certainly arrive, if hearty sincerity, deep mortification, diligent watchfulness, love of Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and an humble and active Faith doth meet and concenter in the heart of any man.</p>
               <p>When he was about the Age of Fifty five years, his Son-in-Law Mr. <hi>Christopher</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He removes to <hi>Great Wrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> with his Son-in-law.</note>
                  <hi>Burrell,</hi> was Presented to the Rectory of great <hi>Wratting</hi> in <hi>Suffolk;</hi> Mr. <hi>Burrell</hi> had lived some years as a Boarder with Mr. <hi>Blackerby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blackerby</hi> now removes and continues a Boarder with him, and that for divers years; in all which time he continued Preaching the Gospel only occasionally (except at <hi>Gastingtherp</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> where he maintained a constant Lecture) until towards the close of his Life.</p>
               <p>When Providence so ordered, that he took upon him a Pastoral charge over the <note place="margin">He was chosen Pastor by a People at <hi>Thurlow,</hi> where he end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his days.</note> Congregation at great <hi>Thurlow;</hi> And here his Master found him so doing, to wit, very busie in his Masters Service; for as he was Preaching on one Lords-day, he was took with a great weakness and fainting while he was in the Pulpit; so that being carried home, he continued very weak six Weeks, but kept his Bed but two days before he died, which was in the seventy seventh year of his Age.</p>
               <p>He had seven Children who lived to be Men and Women, (two Sons, and five <note place="margin">His Posterity.</note> Daughters) his eldest Son was a gracious young man, and lived sometime a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in <hi>Katherine-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but died of a Consumption before he took any Degree. His other Son was also a very good Man, and an excellent Preacher of the Gospel, and died lately Minister of <hi>Stow-market</hi> in <hi>Suffolk.</hi> His eldest Daughter, and his third Daughter, were both married to two Divines, in whom Sanctity, Learning and Ingenuity, strove for victory; the eldest was married to Mr. <hi>Samuel Fair clough,</hi> the other to Mr. <hi>Christopher Burrell</hi> aforesaid; all his Daughters were also married to Pious persons.</p>

               <head>The Life and Death of Mr. <hi>Ralph Robinson,</hi> who died <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1655.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>RAlph Robinson</hi> was born at a Town called, <hi>Heswall,</hi> in <hi>Wyrrall,</hi> which is one of the <note place="margin">His Birth.</note> Hundreds in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> being a <hi>Peninsula</hi> beyond <hi>West-Chester,</hi> of about Fourteen Miles in length, and Five in breadth, stretching it self between <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi> He was born in <hi>June, Anno Christi</hi> 1614.</p>
               <p>His Parents seeing his Ingenuity, and that from his Childhood he was disposed to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">His Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</note> kept him at School till he was fitted for the University, and then sent him to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> where he was admitted into <hi>Katherine-Hall,</hi> and made so good improvement of his time, with the helps which he there enjoyed, as that in a few Years he was furnished with good Abilities for the work of the Ministry.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of our troubles, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1642. He left <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and came to <note place="margin">He comes to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>London,</hi> where he exercised his Gifts in several Churches, and gained much respect among the Ministers, and other Citizens, for the rich Gifts and Graces with which God had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished him: And thus he continued till the Pastoral charge of St. <hi>Mary Woolnoth</hi> in <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard street</hi> fell void, unto which being called, he accepted of it, and was there ordained <hi>Presbyter,</hi> with solemn seeking the Lord by Fasting and Prayer, and by Imposition of <note place="margin">Is Ordained Presbyter. His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> Hands.</p>
               <p>In regard of his Vocation: He was an able, <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and profitable Preacher of the Gospel. As for his Relations, he was a loving Husband, a tender Father, a careful and vigilant Pastor, a good Neighbour, a chearful Companion, and a faithful Friend. In his Judgment, Affection and Practice, he was a thorow, well grounded <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and that upon a Scripture account, as deeming that way of Church-Government, to be most agreeable to the mind of God. He was true and steady to his Principles, without warp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and declining either to the Right Hand or to the Left.</p>
               <p>He was unweariedly laborious in the work of the Ministry, both upon the <hi>Lords-days,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</note> and his weekly <hi>Lecture-days,</hi> which continued half the Year; as also for his Monthly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration Sermon before the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> And truly there was scarce any Minister in <hi>London,</hi> that appeared more frequently than Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> in the Exercises of holy Fasting and Prayer, for which work God had fitted him with Gifts more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. There was scarce any man that ever found him unwilling to make one in ways of <note place="margin">And Parts.</note> extraordinary seeking the Lord, according to the necessities of the times.</p>
               <p>Yet his high parts, great Services, besides many Expressions of Respect in the City, <note place="margin">His Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> did not puff him up with Pride, but they were crowned with a meek and humble Spirit; For who ever saw him proudly passionate, or contemptuously insulting, either towards his Equals or Inferious? His conversation was holy, and unreproveable, the strength of Gods <note place="margin">And unbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mableness. His Zeal.</note> Grace, securing him all his Life long, from the least taint of Scandal.</p>
               <p>Ever since he set forwards in Heavens way, he was upon the Spur, and thence it was that he dispached his Journey so soon. When others supposed that he had not yet seen his <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noon,</hi> he had finished his <hi>Days-work,</hi> and went to <hi>Rest.</hi> He was suddenly and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly taken away.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Saturday,</hi> Three weeks before his Death, he came from <hi>Islington</hi> (where he had a <note place="margin">His Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Country House) to <hi>London,</hi> with a full purpose to preach twice, and to administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the <hi>Lords-Supper</hi> the day following in his own Church; but Friends and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians disuaded him from it, discerning that he had some Feverish Distempers upon him, which himself was not sensible of. All the time of his sickness he was insensible of any pain, and unapprehensive of any Death-threatening Distemper, or Disease upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>Yet being moved to make his <hi>Will,</hi> his Answer was, <hi>I will do it with all readiness, though I perceive not in my self any danger of Death.</hi> And this he added, <hi>I pray you flatter me not, of my Physicians apprehend danger, let me know it; for (I bless God) the thoughts of Death</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Death not feared.</note>
                  <hi>are not dreadful to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A special Friend coming to visit him, he gave him hearty Thanks for remembring him <note place="margin">His Spech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</note> upon a Day of Prayer, adding farther, <hi>I have (I thank God) loved Fasting and Prayer with all my Heart.</hi> And when this his Friend asked him concerning the present frame of his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62667:52"/> Heart, his Answer was; <hi>Though I have not ravishing Joys; yet I enjoy an uninterrupted and satisfying Peace; Not questioning in the least, mine everlasting Happiness, through the Grace</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Faith.</note>
                  <hi>of God in Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time also, when he had begged the Pardon of his Ministerial failings, he professed the comfort which he took, upon the Remembrance of his Uprightness and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, notwithstanding his Weaknesses and Imperfections.</p>
               <p>Being moved to relieve his own Spirit by silent and secret <hi>Ejaculations,</hi> because (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his weakness) it might prove very prejudicial unto him to have any Friend to pray with him; his Answer was, <hi>There is no living without those Exercises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon his tossings and turnings upon his Bed, he was put in mind of the <hi>Rest</hi> in <hi>Christs</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Death.</note> Bosom: <hi>Oh!</hi> (said he) <hi>true Rest can no where else be enjoyed.</hi> And thus quietly he slept in the Lord, <hi>June</hi> 15. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1655. and about the one and fortieth year of his Age.</p>

               <head>The Life and Death of Mr. <hi>John Janeway,</hi> who died <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1657.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>JOhn Janeway</hi> was born at <hi>Lylly,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hertford, October</hi> 27. <hi>Anno Christi</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Birth &amp; Parentage.</note> 1633. of Religious Parents, to whom he gave early Hopes of much Comfort, and the <hi>Symptomes</hi> of somthing more than ordinary, quickly appeared in him, insomuch as some that saw him in his Childhood, much feared that he would not live long: But others thought, that God had somthing more than Ordinary to do for, or by this Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died; And he soon made it to appear that neither of them were much mistaken in their Judgments.</p>
               <p>When he first set forward he soon outran his Superiours for age in Learning: And some <note place="margin">His ripe Parts.</note> that were no incompetent Judges, thought, that for pregnancy of Wit, solidity of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vastness of Intellectuals, and firmness of Memory, he had no Superiours, and few equals, considering his Age, and means of Education.</p>
               <p>He was first initiated in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue by his own Father, and then sent for <note place="margin">His Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> some time to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> School in <hi>London,</hi> under the Inspection and Tuition of famous and industrious Mr. <hi>Langley,</hi> where he made a considerable progress in the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Languages; and when he was about Eleven Years old, he took a great fancy to the Study of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> and of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:62667:53"/>
               <p> About this time his Parents removing into a Village called <hi>Aspoden,</hi> met with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity <note place="margin">He studies the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</note> of having this their Son to be farther instructed by a Learned Neighbour, who was pleased to esteem it a pleasant Diversion to read the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> to him, being now about Twelve years Old. And he made so rare a progress in these profound Studies, that he was able to read <hi>Oughtred</hi> with understanding before he was Thirteen years Old.</p>
               <p>A Person of quality hearing of the admirable proficiency of this young Youth, sent for <note place="margin">His Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</note> him up to <hi>London,</hi> and kept him in his House for some time to read the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> to him: And that which made him the more to be admired, was, that what he did, he did it with such great Facility. He had also no small skill in <hi>Musick,</hi> and in other concomitants of the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1646. he was, by that Learned Gentleman Mr. <hi>Francis Rous,</hi> Provost of <note place="margin">He is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen at <hi>Eaton.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Eaton</hi> Colledge, chosen for one of the Foundation of that School, having been first exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Provost and Posers in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, which was beyond president. There he gave no unsuitable returns to those high expectations which were conceived of him.</p>
               <p>After a little continuance at <hi>Eaton,</hi> he obtained leave of his Master to go to <hi>Oxford</hi> for the perfecting of his studies in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> where he was owned by that great Schollar <note place="margin">His rare Progress.</note> Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> one of the Professors of that University, under whom he attained to a strange exactness in those Studies, their being nothing in them within humane reach, which he would not compass. This Great and Learned Dr. gave him great encouragements and helps, and looked upon him as one of the Wonders of that Age, loved him dearly, and for some time after his Death, could scarce mention his Name without Tears.</p>
               <p>Having spent about a Quarter of a year with Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> he was sent for back to <hi>Eaton,</hi> where he soon gave proof of his great improvement of that short time of his absence. For he made an <hi>Almanack,</hi> and therein <hi>Calculated</hi> the <hi>Eclipses</hi> for many years before-hand: So that, by this time he had many Eyes upon him as the Glory of that School: and that which put an <hi>Accent</hi> upon his <hi>Real</hi> worth, was, that in all this he did not discover the least Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or self-conceitedness, neither did any discernable Pride appear in these Excellencies; So <note place="margin">His Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> that many others took more notice of his pregnant Parts than himself did.</p>
               <p>When he was about seventeen years old he was chosen into <hi>Kings-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to <hi>Kings-Colledge.</hi>
                  </note> at which time the Electors did each of them even contend for the Patronage of this Scholar. He was chosen the First for that year, and an elder Brother which he had for the sixth Place: But he was very willing to change places with his Elder Brother, suffering him to have the First, and himself thankfully to accept of the Sixth Place.</p>
               <p>Besides his great Learning, he was endowed with many other Ornaments of nature. His <note place="margin">His Moral Virtues.</note> deportment candid and amiable: His demeanour courteous and obliging, and that even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his apparent Conversion, so that many who had little kindness for Morality, and less for Grace, yet could not but speak well of him. His great Prudence and Learning did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven command respect where they did not find it. He had very much power over his Passions, and was in a great measure free from those Vices which commonly attend such an age and Place.</p>
               <p>Yet probably all this while he understood little of the necessity and worth of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the pretiousness of his own Soul. He had indeed studied the Heavens, and knew the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, but that was his Contemplation. He thought yet but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of God, who made all these rare <hi>Luminaries.</hi> He pried but little into the motions, and turnings of his own deceitful Heart.</p>
               <p>He did not as yet much busie himself in the serious observation of the wandrings of his <note place="margin">His Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> Spirit. The Creature had not yet led him to the Creator; But he was still too ready to be taken up with meer speculation. Yet God, who from all Eternity, had chosen him to be one of those who should shine as the <hi>Sun in the Firmament</hi> for ever with himself in Glory, did (when he was about eighteen years old) shine in upon his Soul with power, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him, and letting him see what a poor thing it was to know so much of the Heavens, and yet never to come there: And that the greatest knowledge in the World without <hi>Christ,</hi> was but an empty dry Business.</p>
               <p>He now thought that Mr. <hi>Robert Bolton</hi> had good reason for it when he said, <hi>Give me the most Magnificent glorious Worldling that ever trod upon earthly mould, richly Crowned with all the Ornaments and Excellencies of Nature, Art, Policy, and Preferments; Or what Heart can wish besides: yet, without the Life of Grace to animate and ennoble them, he were to the Eye of Heavenly Wisdom, but as a rotten Carkass, stuck over with Flowers: Magnified Dung: Guilded Rottenness; And Golden Damnation.</hi> He now began to be of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi>'s mind, That his work on Earth was to study Heaven, and to get thither: And that except a man might be admitted to greater preferments then this World can bestow upon her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, it were scarce worth the while to be born.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62667:54"/>
               <p> The great and Divine work of Conversion was not carried on in his Soul after that <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and means of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> dreadful manner as it is upon some, who precedently have been very bad (as in the case of Mr. <hi>Rob. Bolton)</hi> or to whom God intends to communicate much, and to make great use of (as in the case of St. <hi>Paul)</hi> but the Lord was pleased, by gentle Draughts to dissolve the Stone, and sweetly to unlock his Heart by the exemplary Life, and Heavenly and powerful discourse of a young Man in the Colledge, whose Heart God had inflamed with a Love to this pretious Soul, whereupon he took the first opportunity to set upon this hopeful Plant, and Gods Spirit did so set home his wholsom instructions and counsel, with such evidence and power, that they proved effectual for his awakening out of his Spiritual <hi>Lethargy.</hi> The rather, being accompanied with the profitable, and powerful Preaching of those two able and worthy Divines, Dr. <hi>Arrowsmith,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> together with his reading several Parts of Mr. <hi>Baxters Everlasting Rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now a strange alteration might easily be discerned in the Man: He now looked quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way to what he had done formerly. He was now so much taken up with things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <note place="margin">His strange Change.</note> the Moon and Stars, that he had little leisure, and less pleasure to think of those things, except it was as they pointed higher. He now began not to tast so much sweetness in those kind of studies which formerly he took so much pleasure &amp; delight in. He now beganto pity them who were curious in their enquiries after every thing save that which was most needful to be known, <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Themselves:</hi> And that which sometimes he esteemed his <hi>Gain, he now counted loss for Christ;</hi> Yea doubtless <hi>he esteemed all things but as Dung and Dross</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of <hi>Christ:</hi> And <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sired to know nothing but Christ and him Crucified.</hi> Not that he looked upon humane Learning as useless: But when fixed upon any thing below <hi>Christ,</hi> and not improved for <hi>Christ,</hi> he then looked upon Wisdom but as Folly, and upon learning as madness, and as that which would make one more like unto the Devil; and more fit for his Service, and as upon that which would put a greater <hi>Accent</hi> upon their misery in another World.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. <hi>Janeway</hi> began to cast about how he might best improve what he did already <note place="margin">His activity for Christ.</note> know, and to turn all his Studies into the right Channel: Grace did not take him off from, but made him more diligent and spiritual in, his Studies: And now <hi>Christ</hi> was at the end and bottom of every thing. O how did he plot and contrive how he might most express his Love and Thankfulness to him who had <hi>brought him out of darkness into his marvellous Light, and translated him into the Kingdom of his dear Son!</hi> To this end he sent up and down Packets of Divine <hi>Letters,</hi> in which he did discourse so substantially and experimentally of the great things of God that it would not at all have unbecome a Gray-Head to have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he wrote.</p>
               <p>He was very like unto young <hi>Elihu,</hi> in whose words he used to excuse his freedom with Persons of Gravity whose Souls he did deeply commiserate. He said, <hi>Days should speak, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Zeal.</note>
                  <hi>multitude of years should teach Wisdom: But their is a Spirit in Man, and the Inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding: I am full of matter; The Spirit within me convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth me: Behold! My Belly is as Wine which hath no vent; It is ready to burst as new Bottles: I will speak that I may be refreshed,</hi> &amp;c. O then how sweet was the Savour of his Graces! How could he not but speak the things which he had seen and heard? And even invite all the World to tast and see how good the Lord was.</p>
               <p>He began first with his near and dear Relations, wooing and begging of them to mind <note place="margin">His Love to his Friends Souls.</note> their pretious and immortal Souls, and speedily to lay in Provisions for a Death-Bed, and Eternity. O with what compassion did he plead the cause of <hi>Christ</hi> with their Souls!</p>
               <p>What <hi>Pathetical</hi> expressions did he use? What vehement <hi>Expostulations?</hi> How frequent? How particular were his <hi>Applications</hi> unto them? O, with what Gravity, and Majesty would he speak of the Mysteries of the Gospel!</p>
               <p>Read what his Language was (when he was between eighteen and nineteen years old) in a Letter to an Antient Minister, neerly related to him, who at that time walked very heavily.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>THere are two things, the want of which I have had experience of in your Family, tho not in every degree, yet in that intenseness of Degree, wherein they ought to be; <hi>which</hi>

                        <hi>are,</hi> The real power of godliness and Religion: And then that which is the fruit of the former, <hi>That chearfulness, delight, spiritual Joy, and serenity of mind which is to be had in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and no where else:</hi> And that, not in Religion in its weakest Degrees, but in a real vigour, power, and life, and in a more close, constant walking with God, from a tender sense of the worth of Souls, especially those of your Family. And knowing the Duty which my Relation to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62667:54"/> it doth lay upon me, and having confidence of their well acceptance of it, I have undertaken to open my Thoughts unto them.</p>
                     <p>In most Families in <hi>England,</hi> I fear, their is neither the form nor the power of Godliness; where there is no fear of God: No regard of him, no acting under him, or in reference to him: These are (in mine opinion) twice Dead, nay not so much as having the Dead Carkass of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Objects of pity they are; And O how few are there that spend one compassionate Thought upon them?</p>
                     <p>Others there are who some way or other, it may be from Tradition, from good Parents, It may be from knowing the fashion of those in their Rank; It may be from the frequent inculcating of good Instructions from Christian Friends, or Godly Ministers; Or some stragling eruptions of Conscience, have gotten the outward Husk, and Shell of Religion, without any Kernel or solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all. And this Generation doth usually trust to this their Religion, that it will bring them to a place like a sleeping Place in Heaven or keep them out of Hell, though they live without God in the World. These are poor Creatures too, making hast to their own destruction and know it not; yea, thinking that they are in afair way for Heaven.</p>
                     <p>O that there were never a Family to which we are related, which gave too sad cause of fear, that it were in such a case or neer such a case as this is. A 3d sort of People there are) and but few of these neither) which have the reality of Religion, but yet in much weakness, coldness, faintness, dimness, and intermissions; like <hi>Nilus's</hi> Brood, above half mud still; beginning to have some life in their Head, a little in their Heart, but the Feet of their Affections and Actions have little o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> no motion. And where shall we find a Christian that is got higher than this? Yea, that doth in good earnest strive to get higher: Now there are higher attainments to be reached after. There is a having our Conversation in Heaven while we are upon Earth: Neither doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in some weak discourses about God, Heaven, and the things of Religion: It consists not in meer praying twice a Day, and in keeping the Sabbath in a usual manner in its order: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not in a few Thoughts of Religious Objects, coming into the Mind in a common way, and as easily lost as got. But true Religion raises the Soul to longings, hungrings, and thirstings, not without some enjoyments. Religion in power is to act for God with strength, vigour, earnestness, intenseness, delight, chearfulness, serenity, and calmness of Mind. The Fruits of the Spirit are Joy in the Holy Ghost, and Peace. Fear, disquiet, and terrors are usually the Introduction to a bette? state, but they are not of the Essentials of Religion: Yea, the contrary frame of Spirit is to be striven for.</p>
                     <p>To speak yet more plainly, and to tell you (Honoured Sir) what fears and what jealousies are, with Reverence to your self, and tender affection to all your Family, I fear that you your self are subject to too many desponding melancholly Thoughts: The Causes whereof give me leave with submission to guess at: The first, I think, may be your reflecting upon your entring upon the Ministry without that reverence, care, and holy zeal for God, Love to Christ, and compassion to Souls, which is required of every one that undertakes that Holy Office. It may be there was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a respect to your own living in the World, then of living unto God in the World: Be it thus; Be it not so bad, or be it worse: The remedy is the same. These have a wounding power in them which will be felt to be grievous, when felt as they are in themselves: But continual sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and sad Thoughts do keep this wound open too long, and are not available to the having of it cured. Wounds indeed must be first opened that they may be cleansed; They must be opened that their filth may be discovered in reference to a purging and healing; But no longer than till the Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> is to be applied, that they may be healed: And when Christ is made use of aright, he leaveth Joy and Comfort; yet a constant Humility of Spirit is no way inconsistent with this Peace of God.</p>
                     <p>A second cause of your heaviness may be, a sense of the state of the People which God hath committed to you: And indeed who can but mourn over People in such a condition; Objects of pity they are, and the more, because they pity not themselves: I have often wrestled with God that he would direct you in what is your Duty concerning them, which I persuade my self is your earnest request. Now after your serious examining your self what your Conscience doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to be your Duty, you do it, and see you do it, you are then to rest upon God for his effectual working. Let not any think to be more merciful then God; For wherein he doth he goes beyond his Bounds: And this is no more cause of heaviness to you, than the Opposition which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles found at any time, was; who notwithstanding rejoyced in Tribulations.</p>
                     <p>An other cause of heaviness may be what divisions are between your self, and some of your Relations. O that a Spirit of meekness and wisdom might remove all cause of sorrow for that. But were the power of Godliness more in Hearts and Families; all the causes of such trouble wouldsoon be removed: There would be less that would deserve Reprehension, and there would be a fittedness of Spirit to give and bear Reproof: To give in meekness and tenderness, and to bear in Humility, Patience, and Thankfulness.</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:62667:55"/>
                     <p> Some Cares and Thoughts you may have concerning your Family when you are gone: But let Faith and fomer Experiences teach you to drive away all such Thoughts. Your constitution and solitariness may also be some cause of Melancholly; But there is a Duty, which if it were exercised would dispel all, which is Heavenly Meditation, and Contemplation of the things which true Christian Religion tends to. If we did walk closely with God, but one hour in a Day in this Duty, O what influence would it have into the whole Day besides, and if duly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, into the whole Life. This Duty with the usefulness, manner, and direction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I knew in some measure before, but had it more pressed upon me by Mr. <hi>Baxters Saints Everlasting Rest,</hi> that can scarce be over-valued; for which I have cause for ever to bless God: As for your dear Wife, I fear the cares and troubles of the World take off her mind too much from walking with God so closely as she ought to do, and from that earnest endeavour after higher degrees of Grace. I commend God unto her, and unto all, this excellent Duty of Meditation. 'Tis a bitter sweet Duty: Bitter unto corrupt Nature, but sweet to the regenerate part if performed aright. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her and your self? Yea, I charge it upon you with humility and tenderness, that God have at least half an hour allowed him in a Day for this Exercise. O this most precious Soul-raising, Soul-ravishing, Soul-perfecting Duty! Take this from your dear Friend as spoken with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and real love and faithfulness. My fear and jealously lest I should speak in vain, maketh me say again, I, or God by me doth charge this upon you.</p>
                     <p>One more direction let me give; That none in your Family satisfy themselves in Family Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: But let everyone twice a Day (if it may be possible) draw near to God in secret Duty. Here secret wants may be laid open: Here great Mercies may be begged with great earnestness: Here, what wandrings and coldness was in a Family Duty, may be repented of and amended. This is the way to get seriousness, reality, sincerity, and cheerfulness in Religion; And thus the Joy of the Lord may be your strength. Let those which know their Duty do it: If any think it not a necessary Duty, let them fear lest they loose the most excellent help for a Holy, Useful, Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Life, under the assistance of Gods Spirit, whil'st they neglect that which they think unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                     <p>Take some of these directions from sincere affection; some from mine own experience; And all from a real and compassionate desire of your Joy and Comfort. The Lord teach you in this, and in the rest. I intreat you never to rest labouring till you have attained to true spiritual Joy and Peace in the Lord, the God of Peace give you his direction, and the foretasts of his comforts in this Life, and perfection in Eternal Life, in the enjoying of infinite holiness, purity, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency through Christ. Thus praying I rest.</p>

                     <head>In another Letter to a Reverend Friend that had the care of many Children, he thus adviseth.</head>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>Sir,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>
                        <hi>YOur Charge is great upon a Temporal account, but greater upon a Spiritual, many Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Another Letter.</note>
                        <hi>committed to your Charge. Out of an earnest desire of the good of Souls, and your own Joy and Peace, I importunately request that you would have a great care of your Children, and be often dropping in some wholsome admonition; And this I humbly, with submission to your Judgment in it, commend to you; Not to admonish them alwayes altogether, but likewise pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately one by one, not letting the rest to know of it; wherein you may please to press upon them their natural corruption, their necessity of Regeneration, the excellency of Christ, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably lovely it is to see young ones setting out for Heaven. This way, I think, may do most good, having had experience of it my self in some small measure. God grant that all may work for the edifying of those which are committed to you. I leave you under the Protection of him who hath loved us, and given himself for us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When he was about Twenty years old, he was made Fellow of the Colledge, which <note place="margin">His love to Souls.</note> did not a little advance those noble Projects which he had in his Head, for the promoting of the interest of the <hi>Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Now how sweetly would he insinuate into the young ones, desiring to carry as many of them as possibly he could along with himself unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Many attempts he made upon some in the same House, that he might season them with Grace, and animate and encourage those which were looking towards Heaven. And as for his own Relations, never was their a more compassionate and tender-hearted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <note place="margin">To his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</note> How many <hi>Pathetical</hi> Letters did he send to them! And how did he follow them with Prayers and Tears, that they might prove successful! How frequently would he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress himself to them in private! And how ready to improve Providences, and visits that he might set them home upon them! How excellently would he set forth the Beauty of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62667:55"/> Christ! How earnestly would he perswade them to enquire into the state of their Souls! How would he endeavour to bring them off from Sandy Foundations, and resting upon their own Righteousness! In a word, He was scarce content to go to <note place="margin">His succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses therein.</note> Heaven without them; and through Mercy, he was very successful among his own Relations, and the whole Family soon savoured of his Spirit. Now were the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren put upon getting by Heart choice <hi>Scriptures, and Catechisms,</hi> and engaged in secret Prayer and Meditation. Father, Mother, Brethren, Sisters, Boarders were the better for his excellent Example, and Holy Exhortations.</p>
                     <p>He was a good Nurse, if not a Spiritual Father to his Natural Father: And some of his Brethren have cause to bless God for ever, that ever they saw his Face, and heard his Words, and observed his Conversation, which had so much of loveliness and beauty in it, that it could not but commend Religion to any that took notice of it. He could speak in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words: <hi>Brethren, My Hearts desire and Prayer to God for you all, is, that you may be saved.</hi> Read what his Heart was in these Words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Distance of place</hi> (said he) <hi>cannot at all lessen that Natural Bond whereby we are</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Letter to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note>
                        <hi>conjoyned in Blood, neither ought it to lessen that of Love: Nay, where true Love is, it cannot. For Love towards you I can only say this, That I feel it better then I can express it; as it uses to be with all affections. But Love felt and not expressed, is little worth. I therefore desire to make my Love manifest in the best way I can. Let us look upon one another, not as Brethren only, but as Members of the same Body whereof Christ is the Head. Happy Day will that be where in the Lord will discover that Ʋnion! Let us therefore, Breath and Hunger after this, so that our closest Knot may meet in Christ. If we are in Christ, and Christ in us there we shall be one with another. This I know, that you cannot complain for want of Instruction: God hath not been to us a dry Wilderness, or a barren Heath. You have had Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept. He hath planted you by the Rivers of Waters: It is indeed the Lord alone who maketh fruitful, but yet we are not to stand still and to do nothing. There is a Crown worth seeking for: Seek therefore and that earnestly, O seek by continual Prayer! Keep your Souls in a praying frame; This is a great and necessary Duty; nay, an high and precious Priviledg. If thou canst say nothing, come and lay themselves in an humble manner before the Lord. You may believe me; For I have (through Mercy) experienced what I say: There is more sweetness to be got in one glimps of God's Love, then in all that the World can afford. O do but try! O taste and see how good the Lord is.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Get into a corner and throw your self down before the Lord, and beg of God to make you sensible of your loss, undone state by Nature, and of the excellency and necessity of Christ. Say, Lord give me a broken a Heart, soften, melt me: Any thing in the World so I may be but inabled to value Christ, and be perswaded to accept of him as he is tendred in the Gospel. O that I may be delivered from the wrath to come! O, a Blessing for me, even for me; and resolve not to be content till the Lord hath in some measure satisfied you. O my Bowels yern towards you: My Heart works. O that you did but know with what affections I now write to you, and what Prayers and Tears have been mingled with these Lines! The Lord set these things home, and give you true Heart to apply them to your self! The Lord bless all means that you do enjoy, for his Blessing is all in all. Give me leave to deal plainly, and to come yet a little closer to you: For I love your Souls so well, that I cannot bear the Thoughts of the loss of them. Know this that there is such a thing as the New Birth, and except a Man be Born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: God's favour is not to be recovered without it. This New Birth hath it's Foundation laid in a sense of sin, and in a godly Sorrow for it, and an Heart set against it: Without this there can be no Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Look well about you, and see into your selves: and you will see that you are in Hells Mouth without this first step, and nothing but free Grace, and pure Mercy, is between you and the state of the Devils. The Lord deliver us from a secure careless Heart. Hear you see a natural Mans condition? How dare you then lye down in security. O look for your Soul's sake! What shall I say? What shall I do for your poor Soul? I say again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance there is no Remission; and Repentance it self may loose its labour if it be not in the right manner. So then Prayers, and Tears, and Groans will not do without Christ. Most, when they are convinced of Sin, and are under fears of Hell, run to Duty, and reform somethings, and thus the wound is healed, and by this Thousand fall short of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For if we be not brougbt off from our selves, and our Righteousness as well as from our Sins, we are never like to be saved. We must see unabsolute need of a Christ, and give our selves up to him, and count all but Dung and Dross in comparison of Cbrist's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. Look therefore for Mercy only in Christ, For his sake rely upon Gods Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:62667:56"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The tearms of the Gospel are Repent and Believe: Gracious tearms! Mercy for fetching: Nay, mercy for desiring; Nay, for nothing but receiving. Do you desire Mercy and Grace? I know that you do, even this is the Gift of God to desire: Hunger after Christ: Let desires put you upon endeavours; The work it self is sweet. Yea, Repentance, and mourning it self hath more sweetness in it then all the Worlds Comforts. Upon Repentance and Believing comes Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; After this Sanctification by the Spirit dwelling in us. By this we come to be the Children of God: To be made partakers of the Divine Nature: To lead new lives: To have a sutableness to God. 'Tis unworthy of a Christian to have such a narrow Spirit as not to act for</hi> Christ <hi>with all the Heart, and Soul, and Strength, and might. Be not ashamed of</hi> Christ; <hi>Be not afraid of the srowns and jeers of the Wicked. Be sure to keep a Conscience void of offence; and yield by no means to any known Sin: Be much in Prayer, in secret Prayer, and in reading the Scriptures; Therein are laid up the glorious Mysteries which are hid from many Eyes. My greatest desire is, that God would work his own work in you: I desire to see you, not as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that the Lord would make me an instrument of your Souls good for which I greatly long.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many such Letters he wrote to his Brethren, and took all opportunities of visiting <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> them, at which times he addressed himself particularly to each of them, that he might see what became of his Letters, Prayers and Tears, and he was very watchful over them, ready to reprove and convince them of Sin, and as ready to encourage any beginnings of a good work in them.</p>
                     <p>Once perceiving that one of his Brothers slept at Family Prayer, he presently took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion <note place="margin">His reproof of one of them.</note> to shew him what an high contempt of God it was: What a little sense such an one must needs have of his own danger: What dreadful Hypocrisy: What a miracle of Patience that he was not awaked in Hell Flames. And when he had been a while pleading with him affectionately, it pleased the Lord to strike in with some power, and to melt and soften his Brothers Heart, being about eleven years old, so that it was to be hoped that then the Lord began savingly to work upon the Heart of the Child: For from thence forward <note place="margin">The suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</note> a considerable alteration might be discerned in him, wherewith he was not a little pleased; and shortly after he took an opportunity to write to him, to mind him of what God had done for his Soul: Begging of him not to rest satisfied till he knew what a thorow change and effectual calling meant. <hi>I hope</hi> (said he) <hi>that God hath a good work to do in you, for you, and by you: Yea, I hope he hath already begun it. But O, take not up with some beginnings, faint desires, lazy seekings. O remember your former Tears! One may weep a little for sin, and yet go to Hell for Sin. Many that are under some such work, shake off the sense of Sin, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Convictions, and return again to folly! O take heed! If any draw back, the Lord will take no pleasure in them: But I hope better things of you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>His Manner also was to observe how his Brethren behaved themselves after Duty: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">His Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence over them.</note> they seemed presently to run after the world greedily, as if Duty were a task, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there seemed to be an abiding impression of God, and the things of God upon them.</p>
                     <p>How great his Love and compassion to Souls was, may appear by these expressions used to one of his Relations: Having shewed how infinitely below a Christian it was, greedily <note place="margin">His Love to Souls.</note> to pursue the things which will be but as Gravel in the Teeth, if we mind not the rich Provision which is in our Fathers House: <hi>O what folly</hi> (said he) <hi>is it to trisle in the things of God! But I hope better things of you. Did I not hope, why should I not mourn in secret for you, as one cast out among the Dead? O what should I do for you, but pour out my Soul like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! and give my God no rest till he should graciously visit you with his Salvation: Till he cast you down and raise you up: Till he wound you and heal you again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus partly with his Holy Example, partly with his Wise and warm Exhortations, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Prayers, Tears, and secret Groans, somewhat of the beauty of <hi>Religion</hi> was to be seen in the Family where he lived.</p>
                     <p>He was mighty in Prayer, and his Soul was oft-times so transported in it, that he forgot <note place="margin">His delight in Prayer.</note> his own and others weakness. Indeed the acquaintance he had with God was so sweet, and his converse with him so frequent, that when he was engaged in this Duty, he scarce knew how to leave that which was so delightful unto him. His constant course for some years was to pray at least three times a Day in secret, sometimes seven, and twice a Day in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Family; and he found the comfort of it beyond imagination, enjoyed wonderful Communion with God in it, and tasted the pleasantness of an Heavenly Life; So that he could experimentally say, <hi>That the ways of Wisdom were ways of pleasantness, and all her Paths Peace.</hi> In his Prayers he wrestled with God, and would scarce come off of his Knees without his Fathers Blessing. He conversed with God with an holy and humble familiarity as with a Friend, and upon all occasions would run unto him for advice, and found won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful success, and oft immediate returns to his Prayers. Take one instance for all.</p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62667:56"/>
                     <p> His Honoured Father, Mr. <hi>William Janeway,</hi> Minister of <hi>Kelshall</hi> in <hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> being sick, and under somewhat dark apprehensions as to the estate of his Soul, he would often say to his Son <hi>John: O Son! This passing into Eternity is a great thing: This Dying is a solemn business, and enough to make any ones Heart to ake, that hath not his Pardon sealed, and his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences for Heaven clear. And truly (Son) I am under no small fears as to my own estate for another World. O that God would clear his Love! O that I could say cheerfully, I can dye, and be able upon good grounds to look Death in the Face, and adventure upon Eternity with well grounded Peace and Comfort!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Son made a sutable Reply for the present; but seing his dear Father still to abide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der despondencies (though all Christians that knew him highly esteemed him for his Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness) he went apart and spent some time in wrestling with God for his Father, earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begging of God, that he would sill him with Joy unspeakable in believing, and that he would speedily give him some token for good, that he might joyfully and honourably leave this World to go to a better. Being risen from his Knees he came down to his sick Father asking him how he felt himself? His Father made no answer for the present, but wept ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, continuing for some considerable time in that Passion, so that he was not able to speak: But after a while, having recovered himself, with unspeakable Joy he burst forth into such Expressions as these. <hi>O Son! Now it is come! Now it is come! Now it is come! I bless God I can die: The Spirit of God hath witnessed with my Spirit, that I am his Child, Now I can look up to God as my dear Father, and to Christ as my Redeemer: I can now say, This is my Friend; This is my Beloved. My Heart is full, it is brim full, I can hold no more</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I know now what that Sentence means, The Peace of God which passeth Understanding. I know now what that White Stone is, wherein a new Name is written, which none know but they which have it: And that fit of weeping which you saw me in, was a fit of everpowering Love and Joy, so great, that I could not for my heart contain my self, neither can I express what glorious discoveries God hath made of himself unto me. And had that Joy been greater, I question whether I could have born it, and whether it would not have separated Soul and Body. Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me bless his holy Name, that hath pardoned all my Sins, and Sealed the Pardon. He hath healed my Wounds, and caused the Bones which he had broken to rejoice. O help me to bless the Lord! He hath put a new Song into my Mouth. O bless the Lord for his infinite goodness, and rich Mercy! O now I can Die! It is nothing. I bless God I can die. I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may well think that his Sons Heart was not a little refreshed to hear such words, and to see such a sight, and to meet the Messenger that he had sent to Heaven returned back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain so speedily. He counted himself a sharer with his Father in this Mercy, and it was welcome upon a double account. 1. As it did so wonderfully satisfy his Father. 2. Asit was so immediate and clear an Answer of his Prayers; As if God from Heaven had said unto him, thy Prayers and Tears for thy Father are heard: Thou like a Prince hast prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did with God: Thou hast got the Blessing thou begedst.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon young Mr. <hi>Janeway</hi> break forth into Praises, and even into an extasy of Joy <note place="margin">Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> that God should deal so Fatherly and familiarly with him; And Father and Son were so full of Joy, light, love, and Praise, that there was a little Heaven in the place. And the young Man thus expressed himself: <hi>O Blessed and for ever blessed be God for his infinite Grace! O who would not pray unto God, verily he is a God that heareth Prayers, and that our Souls know right well.</hi> And then he told his joyful Father how much he was affected with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer despondings, and what he had been praying for just before, with all the earnestness he could for his Soul, and how the Lord had immediately answered him.</p>
                     <p>The Father presently after, whil'st his Son stood by, fell into another <hi>Extasy</hi> of Joy, <note place="margin">Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.</note> which his weak Body was ready to sink under: So that he could now say, <hi>Now let they Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant depart in Peace, for mine Eyes have seen thy Salvation.</hi> He could now <hi>walk in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of the Shadow of Death, and fear no evil.</hi> O how lovely is the sight of a smiling <hi>Jesus</hi> where one is dying! How refreshing is it, when Heart and Flesh, and all are failing, to have God for the strength of our Heart, and Portion for ever! After this his Reverend Father had a sweet calm upon his Spirit to his last breath, having all his Graces greatly improved, he shewed such humility, love to, and admiring of God, contempt of the World; such prizing of <hi>Christ;</hi> such Patience as few Christians attain unto: especially his Faith was much strengthened, by which, with extraordinary confidence he cast his Widdow and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Children upon the care of that God who had fed him with this Heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> in his Wilderness, state and condition.</p>
                     <p>After the Death of his Father, this young <hi>John</hi> did what he could to supply his room, exercising the place of an Husband, Son and Brother, so that he was no small comfort to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62667:57"/> his afflicted Mother, and to all the rest of his Relations that had any Sense of God upon their Spirits, and to one of them, who had lost a Child, he thus addressed himself:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Daily Observation and every Mans Experience gives sufficient Testimony to it, that</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Comfort upon the Death of a Child.</note>
                        <hi>Afflictions of what kind soever, by how much the seldomer they are, the more grievous they seem. We have a long time sailed in the Rivers of Blessings which God hath plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powred out among us: Now if we come where the Waves of Affliction do but a little more then ordinarily arise, we begin to have our Souls almost carried down with fears and griefs; yea, the natural Man, if not counter-powred by the Spirit of God, will be ready to entertain murmuring, and repining Thoughts against God himself: whereas if all our Life had been a Pilgrimage, full of Sorrows and Afflictions (as we deserved) and had but rarely been intermingled with Comforts, we should have been more fitted to bear Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Thus it is naturally: But we ought to counterwork against the Stream of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by a new Principle wrought in us, an a whatsoever Nature doth err in, Grace is to rectifie, And they upon whom Grace is bestowed, ought to set Grace on work. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Grace bestowed unless it should act in us?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It hath pleased the Lord to make a breach in your Family; there where the Knot is fastest tyed, when it is disunited the change becomes greater, and the grief is the more encarged: So that herein you who are most moved, are most to be excused and comforted: The strength of Mothers Affection, I believe, none but Mothers know; and the greatest Affections when they are desturbed, breed the greatest Grief. But when Affliction comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, what will be our Duty? Shall we then give our selves up to be carried away with the grieving Passion? Shall we because of one Affliction cause our Souls to walk in sadness all our Dayes, drive away all the light of Comfort from our Eyes, by causing our Souls to be obscured under the shades of Melancholly? Shall we quarrel with our Maker, and call the Wise, Righteous Judg to our Bar? Doth he not punish us less then we deserve: Is there not Mercy and Truth in all his Dispensations? Shall we by continual Sorrow add Affliction to Affliction, and so become our own Tormentors,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then</hi> (after much other good Counsel) he concludes thus: <hi>Let us therefore have a care of so much as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, much more of entertaining any unworthy Thoughts against God. But let us submit willingly unto the Yoak which he is pleased to lay upon us, lest he break us with his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judgments. And now it hath seemed good to God to lay this stroak upon you, I pray you rightly to improve it, and let this tryal prepare you for greater: And seeing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of all Worldly things, endeavour with all your might to get your Heart above them; And I beseech the Lord who is the great Physician of Souls, and knows how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Salve to every Soar, to comfort you with his Spiritual Comforts; that he would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably shine upon you, and receive you into a nearer Ʋnion and Communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: Into his Hands I commit you: with him I leave you, praying that he would make up all in Himself.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was an excellent Example to his yonger Brethren, and his Prudent Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">His useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to his Brethren.</note> and Holy Practices did not a little influence them. He was a Wise Counseller, and an Assistant that could not well be spared to his Elder Brother, who was not a little sensible of that Personal worth that was in him, whom he used to preffer before himself, as one whom he judged, God had honoured with far greater Parts, Graces, and Experiences then himself: The younger also did as humbly, and heartily respect and honour him as a serious Christian, Minister, and his Elder Brother, who had obliged him with more then ordinary kindnesses.</p>
                     <p>When he was but young, he began to be taken notice of by Ancient Ministers and <note place="margin">His Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> Christians, though his Modesty was so great that his vast Parts were much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seured thereby, and his great worth was so balasted with Humility, that he made no great noise in the World, and most were ignorant of his singular worth. A wise Man that was intimately acquainted with him, used to say of him, that he was like unto deep Waters that are most still: A Man he was of hidden Excellency. There were few that knew how close he walked with God, at what and a high rate he lived, and what a great Trade he drave for the Riches of another World. All which he laboured as much as might be to conceal.</p>
                     <p>His Father being dead, he returned unto <hi>Kings Colledge,</hi> and was one of a private <note place="margin">His return to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there.</note> Society, who began to carry on some notable Projects for God's Glory and the good of Souls, and to design how they might best improve their Gifts and Graces, so as they might be most serviceable unto God, and to their Generation. They used frequently to meet together, to Pray, to communicate their Studies and Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62667:57"/> to handle some Divinity Question in a Scholastick manner, thereby to exercise those Gifts which God had bestowed upon them. Some indeed of this Company de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from their first Principles, but others lived to demonstrate unto the World, that what they did, proceeded from a Vital Seed; amongst whom this young Man was none of the least; who also had a Design upon some of the <hi>Juniors,</hi> to engage them (if possible) unto God before they were ensnared and corrupted by wicked Company, at their first coming to the University, But after a while most of his Dear and intimate Companions were transplanted either into Gentlemens Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, <note place="margin">His Indu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stry.</note> or into Livings, and he, being one of the youngest, was, for a while, lest alone in the Colledge: And he now wanting the diversion of these delightful meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, fell so close to his Studies that he soon gave such a deadly wound to his Bodily constitution, as he could never throughly be cured of, or freed from.</p>
                     <p>Having thus spent sometime in his hard Studies, it fell out that Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> sent to the <note place="margin">His remore to Dr. <hi>Cox.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>Provest</hi> of the Colledge to commend to him a Man of worth that might live in his Family, and be a Tutor to his Son. The <hi>Provest</hi> hereupon was pleased to commend and sent to him Mr. <hi>Jo. Janeway,</hi> who was neither a disgrace to him that sent him, nor yet did he frustrate the expectation of him that entertained him. For by his great diligence, profound Learning, and success in his Undertaking, he much obliged the Relations of his <hi>Pupil</hi> unto him. But here his labour was so great, and his Body so weak, that he could not long bear up under so heavy a burden; insomuch as he was forced to crave leave of the Doctor to try whether the change of the Air might not <note place="margin">His Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> somewhat contribute to the restoring of his Bodily weakness which now begun sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly to be in the wain.</p>
                     <p>During his abode in that Family, his deportment was so sweet and obliging, and his <note place="margin">His success there.</note> Conversation so spiritual and Heavenly, that it did not a Little indear his presence and company unto them; so that, doubtless, some of that Family will carry a sweet remembrance of him with them to their Graves; and he often owned the goodness of God to him, in the benefit which he got by the Graces and Experiences of some Christians in, and Relating to that Family, whose tender love to him he gratefully resented when he lay on his Death-bed.</p>
                     <p>Having left the Doctors House he retired into the Countrey to his Mother and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest <note place="margin">He retires to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Brother, who used their utmost diligence and endeavours to recruit and repair the decayes of Nature in him; But hard Study, frequent and fervent Prayers, and intense Meditations had so wounded and ruinated his frail Tabernacle, and Earthly Cottage, that it could not be throughly repaired again: yet, by God's Blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their endeavours, and use of means, it was supported and held up for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>
                     <p>Whilst he was in this declining condition, wherein he could have little hopes of <note place="margin">Comfort at Death.</note> Life, he was so far from fearing it, that he received the Sentence of Death in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with great joy, and wrote to his nearest and dearest Relations to prepare and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to a willing submission, and ready compliance with the will of God, though they should part with him for a while: And that he might wean their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from him, he solemnly professed, that as for himself he was ashamed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and pray for Life. For (said he) <hi>is there here any thing that is more desirable then is the enjoyment of Christ? Can I expect any thing here below, comparable to that blessed Vision! O that Crown! That Rest that remains for the People of God! And (bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God,) I can say, It is mine. I know that when this Tabernacle of Clay shall be dissolved, that I have an House not made with Hands; and I therefore groan, not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed, but to be cloathed upon with Christ. To me to Live is Christ, and to Die is gain. I can now (through infinite Mercy) speak in the Language of the Apostle: I have sought the good Fight: Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown incorruptible which fades not away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Perceiving one of his nearest Relatious much troubled at the Thoughts of his Death, he charged him not to pray for his Life, unless it were purely in respect to the Glory of God: <hi>I wish (said he) I beg you to keep your Mind in a submiss frame to the Will of God concerning me. The Lord take you nearer to himself that you may walk with him, to whom, if I go before I hope you will follow after.</hi> Yet after this, it pleased God <note place="margin">Some reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</note> that he was finely recovered, and his Friends were not without some hopes that he might recover; and yet be eminently instrumental for God's Glory and the Churches good.</p>
                     <p>Being in some good measure restored to Health he again returned to his former pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62667:58"/> of engaging with all his might in the secret, &amp; great Duties of Religion: Besides others, he set apart an hour every day for set, and solemn <hi>Meditation,</hi> which he found to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <note place="margin">Meditation very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> means to improve his Graces, and encrease his Comforts. His time for this Duty was usually in the evening, and his manner was to walk into the Fields if the weather would permit. Or if not, then he would retire into the Church, or into some solitary room, where one of his Brothers once hid himself, that he might take more exact notice of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course between God and him, but oh (saith he) what a Spectacle did I there see! A Man walking with God: Humbly conversing with his Maker, and maintaining an holy famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity <note place="margin">His Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</note> with the Great <hi>Jehovah!</hi> Methought I saw one talking with God: Methought I saw a spiritual Merchant in an heavenly <hi>Exchange,</hi> driving a rich Trade for the Treasures of another world. O what a glorious sight it was! Methinks I see him still; how gloriously did his Face shine! O with what a lovely countenance did he walk up and down, his lips going, his body oft reaching up, as if he would have taken his Flight into Heaven! His looks smiles, and every motion were as if he had been upon the very confines of Glory. Surely he had Meat to cat which the world knew not of? Surely God made him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come when he brought him into his <hi>Banqueting-House.</hi> His Heart was fed upon the infinite love of God in <hi>Christ</hi> to the poor lost Sons, and Daughters of <hi>Adam.</hi> His words to a dear Friend shewed an extraordinary sense of the freeness, fulness, and duration of that Love: <hi>God</hi> (said he) <hi>holds mine Eyes most upon his Goodness, his unmeasurable Goodness, and upon the Promises which are most sure and firm in Christ: His Love to us is greater, surer, fuller than ours to our selves For when we loved our selves, so as to destroy our selves, he loved us so as to save us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That he might engage others in more ardent affections to God, he would put words into their mouths. <hi>Let us then</hi> (said he) <hi>behold him till our Hearts desire, till our very Souls are drawn out after him; Till we are brought to acquaintance, intimacy, and delight in him! Say, O that he would love me; O that I might love him! O Blessed are they that know him, and are known of him! It is good for me to draw near to God: O that I was received into converse with him, that I might hear his voice; and see his Countenance! For his voice is sweet, and his Countenance comely. A Day in his Courts is better than a Thousand elsewhere. My Soul longeth, yea, fainteth for the Courts of the Lord: My Heart and my Flesh cryeth out for the living God: O that I might communicate my self to God, and that he would give himself to me! O that I might love him, and be sick of Love; That I might die in Love! That I might loose my self in his Love, as a small drop in the unfathomed depth of his Love! That I might dwell in his Eternal Love!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To a dear Friend that was under some fears as to his Spiritual Estate, he thus wrote: <hi>O stand still and wonder: Behold his Love and admire! Now (if never yet, consider what thou canst discover in this pretious</hi> Jesus! <hi>Canst thou not see so much till thou canst see no more, not because of its shortness, but because of thy darkness? Here is a Sea, fling thy self into it, and thou shalt be compassed with the heigth, &amp; depth, &amp; breadth &amp; length of Love, &amp; be filled with all the fulness of God. Is not this enough? Wouldst thou have more? Fling away all besides God: God is Portion enough, and the only proper Portion of the Soul. Hast thou not tasted, hast thou not known that his Love is better than Wine? Hast thou not smelt the savour of his pretious Ointments, for which the Virgins love him? This, this is he who is altogether lovely. And while I write, my Heart doth burn: My Soul is on fire: I am sick of Love,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But now methinks I see you almost drowned in Tears, because thou feelest not such workings of Love towards God: Weep on still; For Love hath Tears as well as Grief: And Tears of Love shall be kept in Gods Bottle as well as the other: Yea, they shall be as pretious Jewels, and an excellent Ornament. Hast thou felt such meltings of Loving-Grief? Know that they are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the streams of</hi> Christs <hi>Love flowing to thee, and through thee, and from thee to him again, And thus is</hi> Christ <hi>delighted in beholding of his own Beauties in his Spouses Eye,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Yet for all this, he had also his gloomy days, and his Sun was sometimes over-clouded, His sweets were sometimes imbittered with dreadful and horrid Temptations: Satan shot <note place="margin">His Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

He was with St. <hi>Paul</hi> many times lifted up into the 3d Heavens, and saw and heard things unutterable: But lest he should be exalted above measure, there was a Messenger of Satan sent to buffet him. It would make a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Heart ake to hear and read what strange Temptations this gracious Soul was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with. But he was well Armed for such a conflict, having on the Shield of Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he quenched the fiery Darts of that wicked one: yet this fight made his very Body to sweat through the Agonies of his Spirit: and caused him to send up strong Cries with Tears for fresh supplies of Grace.</p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:62667:58"/>
                     <p> These Temptations and conflicts with Satan did not a little help him afterwards in his dealing with one who was sorely afflicted with Temptations of the like Nature: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may be of singular use to others in the like case, see what he wrote.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Dear Friend, your Letters are bitter in the Mouth, but sweet in the Belly. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain matter of Joy in a dismal aspect. They are good News brought by a Messenger in Mourning. I had rather hear of that which is matter of substantial, real Joy, though mixed with many sighs, and interrupted with many Groans and Sobs, then in that Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the midst of which the Heart is sad.</p>
                        <p>You say that you are troubled with Blasphemous Thoughts: So then though they are Blasphemous, yet they are your trouble; and thoughts they are too, and that neither sent for, nor welcom, and so are not assented to in your mind. What then shall we think of them? If they were of your own Production, your Heart would be delighted in its own issue: But you do nothing less. Sure then they are the <hi>Injections</hi> of that <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed One,</hi> who is the Accuser of the Brethren, and the Disturber of the Peace of of the People of God: But doth Satan use to imploy those Weapons, but against those that he is in some fear of loosing? He is not wont to assault and fight against his surest Friends in this manner. Those that he hath fast in his own Possession, he leads on as softly and quietly as he can, fearing lest such disturbance should make them to look about them, and so they should awake, and see their danger: But as for those who have in some measure escaped his snares, he follows them hard with all the discouragments he can.</p>
                        <p>Surely these things can be no other but a bitter relish of those things, which you know to be bitter after you tasted the Honey, and the Honey Comb: After you have seen how good the Lord is. What then shall I call these Motions of your Mind? They are the Souls loathing the Morsels which Satan would have it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> swallow down: Yea, they are the Souls striving with Satan whilst he would Ravish the Spouse of <hi>Jesus:</hi> And let the Enemies of all goodness know, that he shall e're long pay dear for such attempts.</p>
                        <p>But you will say, If these horrible Thoughts be not your Sin, yet they are your trouble and misery, and you desire to be freed from them, and the most loyal and loving Spouse, had rather be delivered from these assaults. But you will ask, How shall I get freed from them? <hi>Ans.</hi> First, See that you possess your Soul in Patience: And know this that God hath an over-ruling Hand in all this; and wait upon him: For he can, and will bring forth good out of all this seeming evil. At present you are in the Dark, and see no Light: Yet trust in the Lord, and stay your self upon your God: Can <hi>Christ</hi> forget the purchase of his own Blood? The price of his Soul? Those whom he hath so intimately endeared to himself? Can a Mother forget her sucking Child? Yet God cannot forget his. God hath loving gracious intents in all this, and his Bowels yearn toward his. Yea, our Saviour suffers with us, through his ardent Love, by <hi>Sympathy,</hi> as well as he hath suffered for us. But for your being rid of these Thoughts, you <hi>know</hi> who hath all Power in his Hand; who doth imploy this Power in a way of love toward his: This Power is made yours through the Prayer of Faith: But for your own work do this:</p>
                        <p>First, Let not such Thoughts have any time of abode in your Mind; but turn them all the loathing and abhorrency you can, But not with so much trouble and disturbance of Mind as, (I believe) you do. For by this the Devil is pleased, and he makes you your own Tormentor.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2ly,</hi> Alwayes then divert your Thoughts to some good thing, and let those very <hi>injections</hi> be constantly the occasion of your more Spiritual Meditation. Think the quite contrary, or fall a Praying with earnestness, and the Devil will be a weary if he find his Designs thus broken, and that those Sparks of Hell which he struck in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul to kindle and inflame Corruption, do put warmth into Grace, and set Faith and Prayer a working: When he perceives, that what he intended as Water to cool your Love to God, proves like Oyl to make it flame the more vehemently, he will be discouraged. Thus resist him, and he will fly from you.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>3ly,</hi> Consider that this is no New thing: For we are not in this, ignorant of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Wiles, that if any Soul hath escaped out of his Chains of Darkness; If he will have Heaven, he shall have it with as much trouble as the Devil can lay on; and if he and his had their Wills, no good Man should have one peaceable Hour. But blessed be God for his everlasting and unchangable Love to his, so that the Devil
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62667:59"/> cannot pluck us out of those Almighty Arms, where with he doth embrace his dear Children.</p>
                        <p>Dear Heart: My Prayer for thee is, that God would give thee the peaceable Fruit of Righteousnes after all thy Afflictions: And that thou maist come out of these Tryals, refined, and purified, and more fit for thy Master's Use; having this the end of all, to purge away thy Dross, and take away thy Sin. Thus hoping that at length, God will turn thy Mourning into Joy, thy trouble into Triumph, and all thy Sorrows into a sure and stable Peace, I leave you with Him, and rest.</p>

               <p>He much feared decayes in Grace and <hi>Apostacy:</hi> Yea, of flatness of Spirit; either in himself or others. And if he suspected any such thing in his nearest Relations, he would do alI that possibly▪ he could to recover them out of these Snares of Satan, and to quicken them to more vigorous spiritual Acts of Religion. He laboured to <note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> maintain a constant tenderness upon his Heart, and to take notice of the least depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Soul from God, or of Gods absenting of himself from his Soul. He had a godly Jealousie over his Brother, and desired by all means to carry on the work of Grace, which he had some hopes, was begun in him. He laboured to build sure, and to build up, that he might be rooted and grounded in the Faith, <hi>steadfast and unmoveable, alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi> Wherefore he followed him, not only with private warnings, and frequent <hi>Pathetical</hi> Counsel and Directions, but with Letters also. One of them here follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You live in a place where strict and close walking with God, hath few or no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; and most are apt to be like their Company: And God's own Children are too apt to <hi>forget</hi> their <hi>first Love.</hi> Our Hearts are apt to be careless and to neglect our <hi>watch.</hi> We are ready to grow formal in Duty, and less Spiritual, and then (it may be) less frequent: And Conscience is put off with some poor excuse: And thus Religion withers, and one that seemed once a <hi>Zelot</hi> may come to be a <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean;</hi> and some that looked once as though they were eminent Saints, may fall to to just nothing. It's too common, <hi>To have a Name to be alive, and yet to be dead.</hi> Read this and tremble lest it should be your Case. When we are lazy and a sleep, our Adversary is awake. When we are slothful and negligent, then he is diligent. I consider your Age; I know where you dwell; I am not unacquainted with your Temptations: Wherefore I cannot but be affraid of you, lest both by inward and outward Fire the Bush be singed, though, if God be in it, it cannot be burnt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Give me leave to be in some measure fearful of you, and Jealous over you, and to mind you of what you know already. Principles of Civility will be but as bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Reed to stay our Souls upon, without those higher Principles which are planted in the Soul by the working of the Spirit of God: O remember what meltings you have sometimes had? Remember how solicitously you did sometimes enquire after <hi>Christ:</hi> How earnestly you seemed to ask the way to <hi>Zion, with your Face thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> O take heed of loosing those impressions you once had! Take not up with a slight work! True Conversation is a great thing, and another kind of thing then the most take it to be. O therefore be not satisfied with some Convictions; take them not for Conversion; much less, with resting in a Lifeless formal Profession.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>There is such a thing as being <hi>almost a Christian:</hi> Nay, <hi>as drawing back to Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and some that are not far from the Kingdom of Heaven may never come there. Beware lest thou lose the Reward. The Promise is made to him holdeth fast, and holdeth out to the End, and overcometh, Labour to <hi>forget what is behind, and to press forwards towards what is before.</hi>
                  </q> He that is contented with just Grace enough to get to <q>Heaven, and to escape Hell, and desires no more, may be sure that he hath none at all, and is far from being made a partaker of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> Labour to know what it is to Converse with God: Strive to do every thing as in his presence: Design him in all. Act as one that stands within sight of the Grave and Eternity. I say again, do what you do, as if you were sure God stood by and looked on, and exactly recorded every Thought, Word, and Action; and you may very well suppose that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwise.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let us awake and fall to our work in good earnest. Heaven and Hell are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us and Death behind us. What do we mean to sleep: Dulness in God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is very uncomfortable, and at the best will cost us dear; and to be contented
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62667:59"/> with such a frame, is a certain <hi>Symptom</hi> of an Hypocrite. O how will such trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when God shall call them to give an account of their <hi>Stewardships,</hi> and tell them that they may be no longer <hi>Stewards!</hi> Should they fall sick, and the Devil, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science fall upon them, what inconceivable perplexity would they then be in!</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>O live more upon the Invisibles, and let the Thoughts of their excellencies put Life into your Performances. You must be content to be laughed at for your preciseness and singularity. A Christians walking is not with Men but with God: And he hath great cause to suspect his Love to God, who doth not delight more in conversing with God: and being conformed to him, then in conversing with the World, and being conformed unto it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>How can the Love of God dwell in that Man who liveth without God in the World? Without both continual walking with him in his whole Conversation, and those more peculiar visits of him in Prayer, Meditation, Spiritual <hi>Ejaculations,</hi> and other Duties of Religion; and the working of Faith, Love, Holy Desires, Delight, Joy, and Spiritual Sorrow in them. Think not that our walking with God cannot consist with Worldly Business: Yes, but Religion makes us Spiritual in common Actions; and there is not any Action in a Mans Life, in which a Man is not to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make it a Religious Act, by looking to the Rule in it, and Eyeing God's Glory; and thus he may be said, <hi>To walk with God.</hi> To this we must endeavour to rise, and never be content till we attain it: And if this seem tedious (as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Nature, it will) we must know that we have so much of Enmity against God still remaining, and are under depravation and Darkness, that we know not our true happiness. Such a Soul is sick, and hath lost its taste which doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an incomparable sweetness in walking with God, without whom all things else under Heaven are Gall and Bitterness, and to be little valued by every true Christian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Rest not in any condition in which your security is founded upon the sure bottom, the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Labour to attain to this, To love God for himself, and to have your Heart naturallized, and suited to Spiritual things. O for a Heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and work Righteousness! O that we could do the Will of God with more activity, delight, and constancy. If we did know more of God, we should love him more; and then God would still reveal more of himself to us; and then we should see more and more cause to love him, and wonder that we love him no more. O this, this is our Happiness, to have a fuller sight of God: To be wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up and filled with the Love of <hi>Christ.</hi> O let my Soul for ever be thus imploid! Lord, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee, and there is none on Earth, that I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in comparison of Thee.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>By this we may perceive what it was that swallowed up his Heart; and where his Delight, Treasure, and Life was. His love to <hi>Christ</hi> and Souls made him very <note place="margin">His en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</note> desirous to spend and be spent in the work of the Ministry; and accordingly he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the first clear Call to Preach the <hi>Everlasting Gospel,</hi> and though now he was but about Two and twenty Years Old, yet he came to that Work as one that understood what a kind of imployment Preaching was. He was a <hi>Workman that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be ashamed;</hi> that was <hi>thoroughly furnished for every good Word and Work:</hi> One that was able to <hi>convince gain-sayers:</hi> One in whom the <hi>Word of God dwelt richly.</hi> One <hi>full of the Spirit and Power:</hi> One that hated Sin with a perfect hatred, and loved Holiness with all his Soul, in whom Religion did shine forth in its Beauty: One that knew the <hi>terror of the Lord,</hi> and knew how to beseech Sinners in <hi>Christ</hi>'s stead to be <hi>reconciled unto God:</hi> One who was both a Son of <hi>Thunder,</hi> and a Son of <hi>Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:</hi> So that it might be said of him, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> spake of <hi>Timothy,</hi> That he knew <hi>none like-minded that did naturally care for Souls.</hi> He was one in whom Learning and Holiness did strive which should excell others.</p>
               <p>He never Preached publickly but twice, and then he came to it as though he had been used to that work Forty Years: He delivered the Word of God with that Power and Majesty; with that tenderness and compassion; with that readiness and freedom, that it made his Hearers almost amazed. He was led into the Mysteries of the Gospel, and spake nothing unto others but what was the Language of his Heart, and the Fruit of great Experience; and which (one might easily perceive) had no small impression first upon his own Spirit.</p>
               <p>His two Sermons were upon <hi>Communion, and intimate converse with God:</hi> Out of <note place="margin">His Text.</note> that Text, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Acquaint now thy self with him, and be at Peace: Thereby Good shall come unto thee.</hi> A Subject that few were better able to manage then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62667:60"/> and scarce any could handle so feelingly as he: For he did for some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time maintain such an intimate familiarity with God, that he seemed to converse with him, as one Friend converses with another. This Text he made some entrance into whilst he was on Earth; but the perfecting his acquaintance with God was a work fitter for another World.</p>
               <p>He kept an exact watch over his Thoughts, Words, and Actions, and reviewed all <note place="margin">A Diary kept.</note> that passed, at least once a Day in a solemn manner. He kept a Diary in which he wrote down every Evening, what the frame of his Spirit had been all that Day, especially in every Duty: He took notice what in-comes he had: What profit he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his Spiritual Traffique: What returns came from that far Countrey: What answers of Prayer: What deadness and flatness of Spirit: And what Observable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences did present themselves, and the substance of what he had been doing: What wandrings of Thoughts: What inordinate Passions, which though the World could not take notice of, yet he could and did: This made him to retain a Grateful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God's Mercies, and to live in a constant admiring, and adoring of Divine Goodness. This brought him into a very intimate acquaintance with his own Heart: This kept him Humble, and fitted him for free communications from God: and made him more lively and active: This made him to speak more affectionately and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally to others of the things of God: Yea, this left a sweet calm upon his Spirit, because that every Night he made his accounts even, so that had his Sheet proved his Winding Sheet, it had been all one to him: For he could say, His Work was done, so that Death could not surprise him at unawares. <note place="margin">Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s Studies.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He studied the <hi>Scriptures</hi> much, and they were <hi>sweeter</hi> to him then his <hi>Food,</hi> and he had an excellent dexterity in opening the mind of God in dark places. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his Life he seemed to be wholly taken up with the Thoughts of <hi>Christ,</hi> Heaven, and Eternity. And the nearer he came to his Journies end, the swifter was his Motion thitherward, and more the unmixed were his Designs for them: And he used much to perswade others to a Universal, and free respect to the Glory of God: in all things, making Religion their Business, and not to mind these great things by the by. <note place="margin">Ministers Duty.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He was much concerned about Ministers, that they, above all Men, should take heed, that they carried not on poor and low Designs instead of wholly Eyeing the Interest of God, and Souls. He judged that to take up Preaching as a Trade, was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inconsistent with the Spirit of a true Gospel Minister. He desired that they which seemed to be devoted to the Ministry, would, first, heartily devote their <hi>All</hi> to God, and then have a dear Love to Immortal Souls. He was very ready to <note place="margin">Humility.</note> debase himself, and humbly to acknowledge what he found amiss in himself: and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to amend himself and others.</p>
               <p>He abounded in pitty and compassion to Souls, and yet was greatly grieved and <note place="margin">Pitty to Souls.</note> ashamed, that he did no more to express his sense of the worth of them, and that his Bowels did no more yearn over them, whom he had just cause to fear that they were in a Christless Condition. Though there were few of his Kindred, or Relations: Nay, of his Neighbours, and Acquaintance, but he made a particular Application to them, either by Letters or Conference; yet none were so forward to complain, and cry out of want of Love to Souls, and of unprofitableness to others in his Generation: That he was no fuller of compassion; and for that he made no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an improvement of all the Visits which he made; in which (said he) we should not make carnal Pleasure, and Recreation our End, but the imparting, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of some Spiritual Gift. <note place="margin">Visits to be improved.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He was not a little troubled at the barreness of Christians in their Meetings, and Discourses, not improving their Society for the quickning and warming of each others Heart. The expence of precious time, for which an account must be made: The ill managment of Visits, and the impertinency of their talk, he oft reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with an Holy Indignation. It was a great Grief to his Soul to see what Prizes were sometimes put into the Hands of Christians, and how little skill and will they had to improve them for the building up one an other in their most Holy Faith: And that they who should be encouraging one an other in the way to <hi>Zion,</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of Experiences, and talking of their Countrey, and of the Glory of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of which the Saints are Heirs, could satisfie themselves with vain and empty Stuff, as if <hi>Christ,</hi> Heaven, and Eternity were not things of as great worth as any thing else, that usually sounds in the Ears, and comes from the Lips of Professors.</p>
               <p>An other thing that he greatly bewailed was the want of Love among Christians, and thier <hi>Divisions:</hi> This cost him many Tears, and Groans, and he did what he <note place="margin">Divisions bewailed.</note>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:62667:60"/> could to heal the Breaches by his Prudent and Christian advice and Counsel. He saw so much Pride, Peevishness, and such Divisions among Professors, that it did not a little vex his Righteous Soul, and made him even long to be in a calmer Air, where will be nothing but Union, Joy, and Love. He could not endure to hear Christians to speak reproachfully one of another, because they were of different Judgments and Perswasions. Where he saw most Holiness, Humility and Love, there he let out his Affections most freely. He was of that Holy Man's Mind, who said, <hi>That it is pitty that the very Name of Division is not wholly Buried, and that the time may come when we shall pay dearly for our Ʋnbrotherly, nay, Ʋnchristian Animosities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the latter part of his Life, he lived like a Man that was quite a weary of the <note place="margin">His Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedness.</note> World, and that looked upon himself as a <hi>Stranger</hi> hear, and that lived in the constant sight of a better World. He plainly declared himself to be a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> that looked for a better <hi>Countrey,</hi> for a <hi>City that hath Foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God:</hi> His deportment, his Habit, his Language, all bespake him a Man of another World. His Meditations were of intense, long, and frequent that they ripened him a pace for Heaven, and somewhat with all weakned his Body. Few Christians attain to such a Holy Contempt of the World, and to such clear believing, Joyfull, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <note place="margin">His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God.</note> apprehensions of the Transcedent Glories of the other World.</p>
               <p>He made it his whole Business to keep up sensible Communion with God: and to grow into an humble familiarity with him, and so to maintain it: And if by reason of Company, or any other necessary Divisions he was interrupted in his course, he would complain as one out of his Element, till his Spirit was recovered into a more delightfull, and free intercourse with God again. He was never so well satisfied as when he was more immediately engaged in what brought him nearer unto God: and by this means he enjoyed those Comforts more frequently, which other Christians meet with more rarely. His Faith grew up to a <hi>full Assurance:</hi> His desires into a kind of enjoyment and delight. He was oft brought into the <hi>Banqueting House, and there</hi> Christ<hi>'s Banner over him was Love; and he sat down under his Shadow with great Delight, and his Fruit was pleasant unto his Taste.</hi> He had frequent Visions of Glory, and our <hi>John</hi> (as that Beloved Disciple) lay in his Master's Bosom. His Lord oft called him up into the <hi>Mount</hi> to him, and let him see his excellent Glory. O the sweet foretasts that he had of those Pleasures that are at <hi>the Right Hand of God!</hi> How oft was he Feasted with the <hi>Fat things</hi> of God's House, and with <hi>Wine on the Lees well refined!</hi> This made him rejoycingly to <hi>Run the Race which was set before him▪</hi> whether of Doing or Suffering. He was even <hi>sick of Love,</hi> and could feelingly say to the Poor and Unexperienced World, <hi>O taste and see that the Lord is good:</hi> And to Christians, <hi>Come and I will tell you what God hath done for my Soul!</hi>

               <p>He could take off those aspersions which the Devil and <hi>Athiest</hi> cast upon Godliness in the power of it: He could bring sensible Demonstrations to prove a Deity, and the Reality and Excellency of <hi>Invisibles,</hi> which there ignorant Fools and Mad-men make the Subject of their Scorn: He was one that would not change his Delights with the greatest <hi>Sensualists</hi> living, and could vie Pleasures with all the <hi>Jovial</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants in the World: For which of them can say in the midst of their Jollity, This is the Pleasure that shall last for ever?

                  </gap>, I can be content; yea, Glad to leave these Delights, as knowing that I shall enjoy better. This young Man, in the midst of all his Worldly Comforts longed for Death, and the Thoughts of the Day of Judgment made all his enjoyments much the sweeter. O how did he long for the coming of <hi>Christ!</hi> When some discoursed of that great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <note place="margin">The Day of Judgment desired.</note> Day, he would smile, and humbly express his delight in the fore-thoughts of it.</p>
               <p>He said, What if the Day of Judgment were, as it will certainly come shortly? If I were sure that the Day of Judgment were to begin within an Hour, I should be glad with all my Heart. If at this very instant I should hear such Thundrings, and see such Lightnings as <hi>Israel</hi> did at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> I am persawded my very Heart would leap for Joy. But this I am confident of (through infinite Mercy) that even the Meditation of that Day hath even ravished my Soul, and the Thoughts of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and nearness of it, is more refreshing unto me then the Comforts of the whole World. Surely nothing can more revive my Spirits, then to behold the blessed <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> the Joy, Life, and Beauty of my Soul. Would it not more rejoyce me then <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Wagons did old <hi>Jacob?</hi> I lately Dreamed that the Day of Judgment was come: Methought that I heard terrible Cracks of Thunder, and saw dreadful
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62667:61"/> Lightnings: The Foundations of the Earth did shake, and the Heavens were rolled together as a Garment; yea, all things visible were in a Flame. Methought I saw the Graves opened, and the Earth, and the Sea giving up their dead: Methought I saw Millions of Angels, and <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> coming in the Clouds. Methought I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the <hi>Ancient of Dayes</hi> fitting upon his Throne, and all other Thrones cast down. Methought I beheld him whose <hi>Garments were white as Snow, the Hair of his Head like pure Wool:</hi> His Throne was like the <hi>fiery Flame,</hi> and his Wheels as <hi>burning Fire:</hi> A fiery Stream issued and came from him: <hi>Thousands of Thousands ministred unto him, and Ten Thousand times ten Thousand stood before him; and the Judgment was set, and the Books were opened.</hi> O! But with what an <hi>Extasie</hi> of Joy was I surprized! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought it was the most Heart-raising, and Soul-ravishing sight that ever mine Eyes beheld; and thereupon I cryed out, <hi>I have waited for thy Salvation, O God;</hi> and so I mounted up into the Air, to meet my Lord in the Clouds. <note place="margin">His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He was in a comfortable condition for about Three Years before he died: Not but that he had some Clouds; but he usually walked in a sweet, even, humble, serenity of Spirit, and his refreshing Joyes were more considerable then his Despondings; and though he daily questioned many of his Actions, yet did he not question his estate, but had his Heart fixed upon that <hi>Rock</hi> that neither Winds nor Waves could shake. <note place="margin">Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</note> His Senses were still so Spiritually exercised, as that he could look upon Heaven as his Countrey and Inheritance; to God as his Father; upon <hi>Christ</hi> as his Redeemer. And he counted it the highest Act of Patience to be willing to live, and a great pitch of Self-denial to be contented to be in this World, and to dwell on this side a full and eternal enjoyment of that Holy One, whom his Soul was so much in love with: He <note place="margin">His Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> had vehement, and most earnest desires to be dissolved, and to be with <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the time drew on wherein his Longings should be satisfied, wherein his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment was such, as those Christians which saw him, could not but admire God in him, and look upon him as one of the most singular instances of rich Grace, and bless God that their Eyes ever saw, and their Ears ever heard him. He fell into a deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, which Messenger of God did not in the least damp him. Spitting Blood was no gastly sight to one that had his Eye fixed upon the Blood of <hi>Jesus.</hi> Faint Sweats did not daunt him who had alwayes such reviving <hi>Cordials</hi> at Hand. It was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Joy to him that he had now some Hopes that his longing desires should be satisfied. <note place="margin">He rejoiced at Death approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Having been a while sick, a sudden dimness seized upon his Eyes: By and by his Sight quite failed, and there was such a palpable alteration in him that he and others judged that these were <hi>Symptoms</hi> of his approaching Death; yet was he not in the least surprized hereby, but rather rejoyced to think what a Life he was going to: He looked upon Death as one of his Father's Servants, and his Friend who was sent to conduct him to his Saviour's Glorious Pallace.</p>
               <p>When he found his Body ready to faint, he called for his Mother, and said, <hi>Dear Mother, I am Dying; but I beseech you be not troubled: For I am (through Mercy) quite above the fears of Death; It is no great matter: I have nothing that troubles me but the apprehension of your Grief. I am going unto him whom I love above Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of this fainting fit, the Lord was pleased a little to revive him, having some more work for him to do, before he received his Wages. For though his outward <note place="margin">His Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> Man decaied, yet his <hi>Inward Man was renewed Day by Day.</hi> His Graces were never more active, nor his Experiences greater. For forgetting his pains and weakness he was so swallowed up with the Contemplation of the Life to come, that he had scarce leisure to think of his Sickness. For diverse Weeks together he was never heard to speak the least Word savoured of complaint, or weariness under the Hand of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his eager desire to be with <hi>Christ</hi> be counted <hi>complaining,</hi> and his hast to be in Heaven be called <hi>Impatience.</hi> His Faith grew exceedingly, and his Love was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable, and his Joyes were equal to both.</p>
               <p>O the high and Divine expressions that dropped from his Mouth! It was a very Heaven upon Earth to hear a Man admiring God at such a rate. His Soul for the <note place="margin">Joy unspea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable.</note> Six last Weeks was almost alwayes filled with those <hi>Joyes unspeakable and full of Glory,</hi> which the Apostle mentioneth. How oft would he cry out, <hi>O that I could but let you know what I now feel! O that I could shew you what I see! O that I could express the Thousandth part of that sweetness that now I find in Christ! You would all then think it worth the while to make it your Business to be Religious. O my Dear Friends, you little</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Life feared.</note>
                  <hi>think what a</hi> Christ <hi>is worth upon a Death-bed! I would not for a World; nay; for a Million of Worlds be now without a</hi> Christ, <hi>and a Pardon. I would not for a World live any longer: The very Thought of a possibility to recover makes me to tremble.</hi>

               <p> One that came to visit him, told him, that it might please God to raise him up again, and that he had seen many a weaker Man restored to Health, and that lived many a good year after. And do you think (said he) to please <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> by such discourse as this? No, Friend, you are much mistaken in me, if you think that the Thoughts of Life and Health, and the World, are pleasing to me. The World hath quite lost its Excellency in my Judgment <note place="margin">Contempt of the world.</note> O how poor and contemptible a thing is it in all its Glory, compared with the Glory of that Invisible World which I now live in the sight of! And as for Life, <hi>Christ</hi> is my Life, Health and Strength, and I know that I shall have another kind of Life when I leave this. I tell you, it would more incomparably please me, if you should say to me, You are no Man for this World: You cannot possibly hold out long: Before to morrow you will be in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <note place="margin">Death long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</note> I tell you, I do so long to be with <hi>Christ,</hi> that I could be content to be cut in pieces, and to be put to the most exquisite Torments, so I might but Die, and be with <hi>Christ.</hi> Oh how sweet is <hi>Jesus!</hi> Come Lord <hi>Jesus;</hi> come quickly. Death, do thy worst. Death hath lost its terribleness. Death, it is nothing: I say, Death is nothing (through Grace) to me. I can as easily Die as shut mine Eyes, or turn my Head and sleep. I long to be with Christ, I long to Die.</p>
               <p>His Mother and Brethren standing by, he said <hi>Dear Mother, I beseech you as earnestly as ever I desired any thing of you in my life, that you would chearfully give me up to Christ: I beseech you do not hinder me now I am going to Rest and Glory. I am afraid of your Prayers, lest they will pull one way, and mine another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then turning to his Brethren, he thus spake unto them; <hi>I charge you all, Do not pray for my life any more; you do me wrong if you do. O the Glory! The unspeakable Glory that I</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.</note>
                  <hi>behold! my Heart is full: my Heart is full. Christ smiles, and I cannot chuse but smile: Can you find, in your Heart to stop me who am now going to the compleat and eternal Enjoyment of Christ? Would you keep me from my Crown? The Arms of my Blessed Saviour are open to embrace me: The Angels stand ready to carry my Soul into his Bosom. O! did you but see what I see, you would all cry out with me, How long (Dear Lord) Come Lord Jesus; Come quickly. O why are his Chariot wheels so long a coming!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Reverend, Godly, and Judicious Minister came often to visit him, discoursing of the Excellency of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Glory of the Invisible World: Sir, (said he) <hi>I feel something of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tasts of Heaven.</note>
                  <hi>it. My Heart is as full as it can hold in this lower State: I can hold no more here. O that I could but let you know what I feel!</hi> As this Minister was praying with him, his Soul was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished with the abundant incomes of Light, Life, and Love, so that he could scarce bear it, nor the thoughts of staying any longer in the World from it; longing to be in such a condition wherein he should yet have more Grace, and more Comfort, and be better able to bear that weight of Glory; some manifestations whereof did even sink his weak Body; and had he not been sustained by God's great Power, his very Joyes would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed him. Whilst he was in these <hi>Extasies</hi> of Joy and Love, he was wont to cry out:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who am I Lord, Who am I, that thou shouldest be mindful of me! Why me, Lord, Why</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Free Grace admired.</note>
                  <hi>me! And pass by Thousands to look upon such a wretch as I! O what shall I say unto thee, O thou Preserver of Men! O why me, Lord, Why me! O blessed, and for ever blessed be Free Grace! How is it, Lord, that thou shouldest manifest thy self unto me, and not unto others? Even so Father, because it seems good in thine Eyes. Thou wilt have Mercy, because thou wilt have Mercy. And if thou wilt look upon such a poor Worm, who can hinder? Who would not love thee! O blessed Father! O how sweet and gracious hast thou been unto me! O that he should have me in his Thoughts of Love, before the Foundations of the World!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus he went on admiring and adoring God in a most high and heavenly manner. He was wonderfully taken with God's goodness to him in sending that Aged and Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Minister to him, to help him in his last great work upon Earth. <hi>Who am</hi> I (said he) <hi>that God should send to me a Messenger, one of a Thousand to assist me thus!</hi> Though he most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was in a Joyful, Triumphant frame of Spirit, yet sometimes he had some small intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, in which he would cry out, <hi>Hold out Faith and Patience: Yet a little while and your work is done.</hi> And when he found not his Heart wound up to the highest pitch of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Admiration and Love, he would with great sorrow thus bemoan himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And what's the matter now (O my Soul!) What, wilt thou; canst thou thus unworthily sleight this admirable and astonishing Condescention of God to thee! Seems it a small matter that the great</hi> Jehovah <hi>should deal thus familiarly with his Worm? And wilt thou pass this over as a common mercy? What meanest thou, O my Soul, that thou dost not constantly adore and praise this rare, strong, and unspeakable Love! Is it true, O my Soul! doth God deal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with Man, and are his humble, zealous, and constant Love, Praise and Service too good for God! Why art thou not, O my Soul, swallowed up every moment with this free, unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd,</hi>

                  <hi>everlasting Love!</hi> And then he brake out again into an other Triumpant <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie</hi> of Praise and Joy, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stand astonished ye Heavens, and wonder O ye Angels at this infinite Grace! Was</hi>

                  <hi>ever any under Heaven more beholding to free Grace then I? Doth God use to deal thus with his Creatures? Admire him for ever and ever, O ye Redeemed Ones! O those Joyes of which I have the taste! Those Everlasting Joyes that are at his Right Hand for Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more! Eternity, Eternity it self, is too short to Praise this God in. O bless the Lord with me, and let us shout for Joy, and boast in the God of our Salvation. O help me to Praise the Lord for his Mercy endures for ever.</hi>

               <p>One of his Brethren (that had reaped much good by him) praying with him, and seeing him (as he judged) near to his Dissolution, desired that the Lord would be pleased to continue those astonishing, and Soul-supporting Comforts to the last Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Breath; and that he might go from one Heaven to another; from Grace and Joy imperfect, to perfect Grace and Glory. And when his work was done here, to give him (if it were his Will) the most easie and Triumphant Passage to <hi>Rest;</hi> and that he might have an <hi>abundant entrance administred into the Everlasting Kingdom of of our Lord and Saviour,</hi> Jesus Christ. Prayer being ended, he brake out into a wonderful Passion of Joy, crying out, <hi>Amen, Amen, Amen: Hallalujah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I (saith mine Authour) do verily believe that it exceeds the highest <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> to set out to the Life what this Heavenly Person did then deliver. We want words to declare it, and so did he; for he saw things unutterable. He talked as if he had been in the third Heavens, and brake out into such words as these: <hi>O He is come! He his come! O how Sweet, How Glorious is the Blessed</hi> Jesus! <hi>How shall I do to speak</hi>

                  <hi>the Thousandth part of his Praises! O for Words, to set out a little of that Excellency! But it is unexpressible. O how Excellent, Glorious, and Lovely is the precious</hi> Jesus! <hi>He is sweet, He is altogether Lovely! And now I am sick of Love; He hath ravished my Soul with his Beauty! I shall Die sick of Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O my Friends, stand by and wonder: Come look upon a dying Man and Wonder: I cannot my self but wonder: was there ever a greater kindness. Was there ever more sensible manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations of rich Grace! O why me, Lord why me! Sure this is a Kin to Heaven; and if I were never to enjoy more then this, it were well worth all the Torments that Men and Devils could invent, to come through even an Hell to such unspeakable Joyes as these. If this be Dying, Dying is sweet: Let no true Christian ever be afraid of Dying. O Death is sweet to me! This Bed is soft!</hi> Christ<hi>'s Arms and Kisses, his Smiles and Visits, sure they would turn Hell into Heaven. O that you did but see and feel what I do! Come and behold a Dying Man more chearful then you ever saw any Healthful Man in the midst of his sweetest Enjoyments! O Sirs, Worldly Pleasures are poor, pittiful, sorry things, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with one glimps of this Glory, which shines so strongly into my Soul! O, Why should any of you be so sad, when I am so glad? This, This is the Hour that I have waited for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About Eight and Forty Hours before his Death, his Eyes were dim, and his Sight <note place="margin">Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</note> much failed; his Jaws trembled, and his Feet were cold, and all the <hi>Symptoms</hi> of Death were upon him, and his remoat Parts were almost Dead and Sensless; And yet, even then his Joyes (if possible) were greater still. He had so many Fits of Joy unspeakable, that he seemed to be in a continued Act of Love and Praise. He spake as one that was just entering into the Gates of the <hi>New Jerusalem:</hi> His greatest part was already in Heaven: Not a word dropped from his Mouth but breathed of <note place="margin">Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> and Heaven. O, what encouragement did he give to them that stood by to follow hard after God, and to follow <hi>Christ</hi> in an Humble, Believing, Zealous course of Life, and of adding one Degree of Grace to another, and to use all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make their Calling and Election sure: Saying, that then they also should find a glorious Passage into Blessed Eternity.</p>
               <p>But the most of his work was Praise: A Hundred times over he admired the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless Love of God to him, Crying, <hi>O why me, Lord, Why me?</hi> And then he would give Instructions to them that came to see him. He was scarce ever silent, the Love <note place="margin">Christ dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved.</note> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and Souls constraining him to do all the good that possibly he could: And that Holy Minister that was so much with him, perswaded him to be content to live a little longer, and patiently to wait Gods leisure, who sure had something for him to do, which was yet undone: Some word of Exhortation to some poor Soul that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto was forgotten.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, he was so filled with the Love of <hi>Christ</hi> that he could scarce bear to be absent from him for a moment. He knew that he could be capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62667:62"/> greater Glory in Heaven, then he could here. Every Evening he used of his Friends, Hoping that he should see them no more till the Morning of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And he desired them to be careful to make sure of a comfortable meeting at their Father's House in the other World.</p>
               <p>When Ministers or private Christians came to him, he would beg of them that <note place="margin">His Praises.</note> they would spend all the time that they had with him in Praises. O (said he) <hi>Help me to Praise God, I have now now nothing else to do from this time to Eternity, but to praise and love God. I have what my Soul desires upon Earth. I cannot tell what to pray for, but what I have gratiously given in. The wants that are capable of being supplied in this World, are supplied. I want but one thing, and that is, a speedy lift to Heaven. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no more here: I desire no more: I cannot bear more. O Praise, Praise, Praise that infinite boundless Love that hath, to a wonder, looked upon my Soul, and hath done more for me, then for Thousands of his Dear Children. O Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, bless his Holy Name! O help me, help me, O my Friends, to Praise, and Admire him who hath done such astonishing things, and wonders for my Soul! He hath pardoned all my Sins, and hath filled me with his Goodness: He hath given me Grace and Glory, and no good thing hath he withheld from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Come, help me with Praises, yet all is too little. Come help me all ye Mighty and Glorious Angels, who are so well skil'd in this Heavenly work of Praise! Praise him, all ye Creatures upon Earth: Let every thing that hath being help me to Praise God:</hi> Halla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah, hallalujah, hallalujah! <hi>Praise is now my work, and I shall be engaged in this sweet Work forever. Bring the Bible: turn to</hi> David<hi>'s</hi> Psalms, <hi>and let us sing a</hi> Psalm <hi>of Praise. Come let us lift up our Voices in the Praises of the Most High. I will Sing with you as long as my Breath doth last; And when I have none I shall do it better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then turning to some of his Friends that were weeping; he desired them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, rather then to weep upon his account. It was a wonder that a Man so weak could speak so much: But the <hi>Joy of the Lord was his strength.</hi> In hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Sickness those Scriptures which he took most delight in were the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and Seventeenth Chapters of St <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel. Also the Fifty fourth of the Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> was very delightful to him: with abundance of Joy he oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated those Words, <hi>With Everlasting Mercies, will I gather you.</hi> He commended the study of the Promises to Believers, and desired them that they would be sure to make good their claim to them, and then they might come to the <hi>Wells of Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and there drink their fill.</p>
               <p>According to his desire most of the time was spent in Praises, and he would still be calling, <hi>More Praises yet: O help me to Praise God, I have now nothing else to do! I have done with Prayer, and all other Ordinances. I have almost done conversing with Mortals: I shall presently behold</hi> Christ <hi>himself that died for me, and loved me, and washed me in his own Blood. I shall before a few Hours be over be in Eternity, singing the Song of</hi> Moses, <hi>and the Song of the</hi> Lamb. <hi>I shall presently stand upon Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>with an innumerable Company of Angels, and the Spirits of Just Men made perfect, and with</hi> Jesus, <hi>the Mediator of the New Covenant: I shall hear the Voice of much People, and be one amongst them, which shall say</hi> Hallelujah, <hi>Glory, Salvation, Honour, and Power unto the Lord our God: and again we shall say</hi> Hallelujah. <hi>And yet a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, and I shall Sing unto the</hi> Lamb, <hi>a Song of Praise, saying, Worthy art thou to receive Praise, who wast slain, and hast Redeemed us unto God by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation, and hast made us unto our God, Kings, and Priest, and we shall Reign with thee for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Methinks I stand, as it were, with one Foot in Heaven, and the other upon Earth Methinks I hear the Mellody of Heaven, and by Faith I see the Angels waiting to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my Soul to the Bosom of</hi> Jesus, <hi>and I shall be for ever with the Lord in Glory. And who can choose but rejoyce in all this?</hi> Much of this he repeated over and over with greater Affections then can be expressed by Words.</p>
               <p>The Day before his Death, he looked earnestly upon his Brother <hi>James,</hi> who stood by very sad, whom he judged to be putting up some <hi>Ejaculations</hi> unto God upon his account, to whom he said, <hi>I thank thee, Dear Brother, for thy Love: Thou art now praying for me: And I know that thou lovest me dearly: But</hi> Christ <hi>loves me ten Thousand times more then thou doest. Come and kiss me, Dear Brother, before I Die:</hi> And so with his cold dying Lips he kissed him, saying, <hi>I shall go before, and I hope thou shalt follow after to Glory.</hi> Though he slept but very little for some Nights, yet he was not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62667:63"/> in the least impaired in his Intellectuals; his Actions were all decent, and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to a Spiritual understanding, highly rational, solid, and Divine: And so he continued to the last Minute of his Breath.</p>
               <p>A few Hours before his Death he called all his Relations, and Brethren together, <note place="margin">He blesseth his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> that he might give them one solemn warning more, and Bless them, and Pray for them, as his breath and strength would give him leave; which he did with abundance of Authority Affection, and Spirituality, as follows.</p>
               <p>First, He thanked his Dear Mother for her tender Love to him, and desired that <note place="margin">His Mother.</note> she might be in Travel to see <hi>Christ</hi> formed in the Souls of the rest of her Children, see of the Travel of her Soul, and meet them with Joy in that Great Day.</p>
               <p>Then be charged all his Brethren and Sisters in general, as they would answer it <note place="margin">His Eldest Brother.</note> before God, that they should carry themselves dutifully to their dear Mother. As for his Eldest Brother (at whose House he lay Sick) his Prayer was, that he might be swallowed up of <hi>Christ,</hi> and with Love to Souls, and be more and more Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in his Life, successful in his Ministry, and that he might finish his course with Joy.</p>
               <p>His next Brother was <hi>Andrew,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> whom (though absent) <note place="margin">His second Brother.</note> he thus Blessed: The God of Heaven remember my poor Brother in <hi>London.</hi> The Lord make him truly Rich, in giving him the Pearl of great Price, and make him a Fellow Citizen with the Saints, and of the Houshold of God: the Lord deliver him from the Sins of that City: May the World be kept out of his Heart, and <hi>Christ</hi> dwell there. O that he may be, as his Name is, <hi>A strong Man,</hi> and that I may meet him with Joy.</p>
               <p>Then called he for his Brother <hi>James</hi> (to whom he hoped that God had made him <note place="margin">His third Brother</note> a Spiritual Father) to whom he thus spake, Brother <hi>James,</hi> I hope that God hath given thee a goodly Heritage: The Lines are fallen to thee in Pleasant Places. The Lord is thy Portion. I hope the Lord hath shewed unto thee the worth of a <hi>Christ.</hi> Hold on, (dear Brother) <hi>Christ,</hi> Heaven, and Glory are worth striving for. The Lord give thee more abundance of his Grace.</p>
               <p>His next Brother <hi>Abraham</hi> was called, to whom he thus spake: The Blessing of the <note place="margin">His fourth Brother.</note> God of <hi>Abraham</hi> rest upon thee: The Lord make thee a Father of many Spiritual Children.</p>
               <p>His Fifth Brother was <hi>Joseph,</hi> whom he thus Blessed: Let him bless thee <hi>(O Joseph)</hi> who blessed him that was Seperated from his Brethren. O that his Everlasting Arms <note place="margin">His fifth Brother.</note> may take <hi>hold</hi> of thee! It is enough if yet thou maist live in his Sight. My Heart hath been working towards thee, Poor <hi>Joseph,</hi> and I am not without Hopes, that the Arms of the Almighty will embrace thee. The God of thy Father bless thee with Blessings of Heaven above.</p>
               <p>The next was his Sister <hi>Mary,</hi> to whom he said; Poor Sister <hi>Mary,</hi> thy Body is weak, <note place="margin">His first Sister.</note> and thy Daies will be filled with bitterness: Thy Name is <hi>Marah:</hi> The Lord sweeten all with his Grace and Peace, and give thee Health in thy Soul. Be patient; make sure of <hi>Christ,</hi> and all is well.</p>
               <p>Then his Sister <hi>Sarah</hi> was called, whom he thus blessed: Sister <hi>Sarah,</hi> thy Body is strong <note place="margin">His second Sister.</note> and healthful; O that thy Soul may be so too! The Lord make thee, first a wise Virgin, and then a Mother in <hi>Israel:</hi> A Pattern of Modesty, Humility and Holiness.</p>
               <p>Then his Brother <hi>Jacob</hi> was called, whom he thus blessed: The Lord make thee an <note place="margin">His sixth Brother.</note>
                  <hi>Israelite</hi> indeed, in whom there is no guile. O that thou mayest learn to wrestle with God, and like a Prince, prevail, and not go without the Blessing!</p>
               <p>Lastly, He prayed for his youngest Brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who was but an Infant. Poor <note place="margin">His seventh Brother.</note> little <hi>Benjamin;</hi> O that the Father of the Fatherless would take care of thee, Poor Child, that thou which never sawest thy Father upon Earth, mayest see him with Joy in Heaven! The Lord be thy Father and Portion: Mayest thou prove the Son of thy Mothers Right Hand, and the Joy of her Age.</p>
               <p>O that none of us all may be found among the unconverted at the Day of Judgment! O that every one of us may appear with our Honoured Father, and Dear Mother, before <hi>Christ</hi> with Joy, that they may say, <hi>Lord, here are we, and the Children which thou hast graciously given us!</hi> O that we may live to God here, and live with him hereafter. And now my Dear Mother, Brethren and Sisters, farewel: I leave you for a while, <hi>and commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among them which are sanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now Dear Lord, my Work is done; I have finished my course; <hi>I have fought the</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:62667:63"/>
                  <hi>good Fight, and henceforth there remaineth for me a Crown of Righteousness!</hi> Now come Dear <hi>Lord Jesus;</hi> come quickly.</p>
               <p>The afore-mentioned godly Minister came now to give him his last Visit; and when he spake to him, his Heart was in a mighty Flame of Love and Joy, which drew Tears of Joy from this Minister, and was amazed to hear a Man just a dying, talk as if he had been with <hi>Jesus,</hi> and came from the immediate presence of God. O the smiles that were then in his Face, and the unspeakable Joy that was in his Heart! O the Praises, the Triumphant Praises that were in his Mouth! And every one must speak Praises that were about him, or else they made a Jar in his <hi>Harmony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little before his Death in the Prayer, or rather Praises, which were returned for him, he was so wrapped up with Admiration and Joy, that he could scarce forbear shouting for Joy. In the conclusion of that Duty, with abundance of Faith and Fervency, he said aloud, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now his longing Desires shall be soon satisfied. He sees Death coming apace to do his office; his Jaws were loosened more and more, and quivered greatly. His Hands and Feet were as cold as Clay. A cold Sweat was upon him. But O! how glad was he when he felt his Spirit just a going! Though the pangs of Death were strong, yet that <hi>far more exceeding, and Eternal Weight of Glory,</hi> made him bear those bitter pains with much patience and courage.</p>
               <p>In the extremity of his pains, he desired his Eldest Brother to lay him a little lower, and to take away one Pillow from him, that he might Die with the more ease: His Brother replied, That he durst not for a World do any thing that might hasten his Death a moment. Then he was well satisfied, and resigned up himself wholly unto God's disposal. And after a few minutes, with a sudden motion, gathering up all his strength, he gave himself a little turn on one side, and in the twinkling of an Eye departed to the Lord, sleeping in <hi>Jesus.</hi> Aged between Twenty Three, and Twenty Four, in the month of <hi>June, An.

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Mr.</hi> John Machin, <hi>who Died</hi> Anno Christi 1664.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>JOhn Machin</hi> was the Son of <hi>John Machin</hi> of <hi>Seabridge,</hi> near <hi>New-Castle,</hi> in the County <note place="margin">His Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</note> of <hi>Stafford.</hi> His Mother <hi>Katherine</hi> was of the <hi>Vernons</hi> of <hi>Audley,</hi> in the same County. His Father was a wise man, of a good Estate, and an Antient Free-holder: That Estate of <hi>Seabridge</hi> having continued in the Name of the <hi>Machins,</hi> from the 23d of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and our <hi>John</hi> was the Seventh Generation of the Name that have inherited that Estate.</p>
               <p>This <hi>John</hi> was born at <hi>Seabridge, Octob.</hi> 2. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1624. and Baptized the same <note place="margin">Birth.</note> day at <hi>New-Castle.</hi> He was the only Son of his said Parents, and was therefore carefully brought up by them in his Youth at the best Schools that were thereabout; especially under pious Mr. <hi>Orme</hi> of <hi>New-Castle,</hi> and deservedly famous Mr. <hi>John Ball</hi> of <hi>Whitmore,</hi> who <note place="margin">Education.</note> brought up several Youths in School-Learning, together with his own Sons.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>John</hi> was first intended to be sent to the <hi>Inns of Court;</hi> but his Parents tenderness of him, and unwillingness to part with him to such a distance, was, probably, a hinderance of that design. Whereupon being taken from School, he was imployed about Husbandry for some years, and followed some youthful Recreations. In particular, he was given to Cock-fights, whereupon himself (in some <hi>Memoirs)</hi> wrote thus: <hi>Twenty years did I live the Devil's Bond-slave, which indeed is Time lost, and not Living in a good sense,</hi> (Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3.) And he often said to one of his Dear Friends, as they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>He was then very ready to hearken to any motion of Marriage made to him, yet did not then close with any. One at <hi>Ʋtoxiter</hi> he was nearest to a conclusion with, but she dying in the mean time, it proved an occasion of his going to the <hi>Ʋniversity</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Cambridg.</hi>
                  </note> For his Father was induced, by the advice of a Friend to let him go to <hi>Cambridge</hi> for a Quarter of a Year: Scarce intending that he should be admitted into any Colledge, but to abide there for some short time to learn farther breeding; and he gladly accepted the Motion, and went thither in <hi>December, Anno Christi,</hi> 1645. And there finding some Kindred and Acquaintance, he was admitted into <hi>Jesus Colledge.</hi>

               <p> The first Year it pleased God to make a gracious change in him, of which he thus <note place="margin">His Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> saith: <hi>The Time of my Conversion was in the Twenty first Year of my Age</hi> (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) <hi>The Place was</hi> Jesus Colledge <hi>in</hi> Cambridge. <hi>The Texts that most overturned me were, Eph.</hi> 6. 12, 13, 14 &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 22. The one Preached on by Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> the other by a <hi>Stranger.</hi> He often shewed some of his Acquaintance the Seat in which he was first wrought upon, and told them early be loved the sight of it, and that ever after he chose to sit in that Seat, rather than in any other, if possibly he could croud into it. This was one evidence, among many others, of the eminent success which God gave to that faithful plain Preaching of that Holy Man of God, Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> who went over that whole <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> in a Lecture, ever <hi>Lord's Day</hi> in the Morning at six of the Clock, which he continued for several Years.</p>
               <p>Learned Dr. <hi>Arrowsmith</hi> also about the same time Preached over a succinct <hi>Body of Divinity</hi> in <hi>Aphorisms</hi> in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Colledge, in the Evenings of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day</hi> (part whereof is since published) of which our <hi>John</hi> hath often said, <hi>That he found his Heart so moulded to the Truths delivered, upon the hearing of them, that it was greatly to his Spiritual Joy, and satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No sooner did he find this blessed change in his own Heart, but his Friends at <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg</hi>

               <p>Whilst he was in the <hi>Ʋniversity</hi> he so followed his Studies, that being of ripe Years, and having very good natural Parts, and religiously making Conscience of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence <note place="margin">His Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</note> of Time, he made a good progress in Learning, and was not inferior to any in the Colledge of his standing when he left the <hi>Ʋniversity.</hi> And though, in his Preaching, he made no shew of Learning, as some do: Yet he made good use of it, and understood well the necessity of it for the enabling of him to his work.</p>
               <p>About the time of his Great Grandfathers Death, which in <hi>March, Anno Christi,</hi> 1647. he was sick of a dangerous Spotted Feavour at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and that unto <note place="margin">His Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Death, as himself, and most about conclude, which he thus mentions: That it was in <hi>Jesus</hi> Colledge, in a <hi>middle</hi> Chamber, next to the <hi>Chappel</hi> on the Right Hand: But (saith he) <hi>God having some work for me to do, had Mercy on me</hi> (Phil. 2. 27.) <hi>saved me, and brought me back again:</hi> To say with the <hi>Psalmist, Thou hast delivered my Soul from Death: Wilt thou not deliver my Feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the Land of the Living?</hi> Psal. 56. 13. And again, <hi>I shall not Die, but Live, and declare the works of the Lord: The Lord hath chastened me sore, but he hath not given me over unto Death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>In this Sickness the Lord dealt most powerfully with his Soul, planting therein great and firm resolutions, of serving his God eminently in case of Recovery, which accordingly (by the assistance of his Grace) he faithfully performed: And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he set up a meeting of some Schollars for Religious purposes, which continued in the Colledge for several Years after his Departure, to the restraining (at least) of <note place="margin">Piety.</note> some, and to the great Spiritual advantage of many others; which he managed with such Prudence and Caution, that they could not easily become the <hi>Nurserys of Faction,</hi> or false <hi>Doctrine,</hi> what ever the Ignorance, and Malice of sensless frothy Persons did slanderously vent to the contrary, We may see a farther account of him, and of his <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> usefulness in the Colledge in these few Clauses in several Letter that were sent to him from some worthy Members of that Society:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dear Friend, I received your loving Letters, which breath nothing but Piety and good</hi>

                  <hi>benefit of your Prayers and best Affections, which is a Treasury I alwayes desired to prize above all the Jewels in the World,</hi> &amp;c. And from an other eminent Person thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My dear and precious Friend: I received yours, and your Lines sweetly refresh me. O that I could hear oftner from you: It glads my Soul to see your constancy. O that your Example might be a Motive and Incentive to me, to be more steady, setled, and fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in the wayes of God,</hi> &amp;c. These are but a taste of the many Letters he received from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> wherein several do bless the Lord that ever they saw his Face.</p>
               <p>But his Activity in God's Service was not a little disturbed by the Malice of <note place="margin">Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Satan, who frequently after his Recovery from Sickness, disturbed and tormented him dreadfully in his Dreams, so that he hath often, immediatly upon his waking, run in his Wastcoat into his Study, and betaken himself to his earnest and servent Prayers against that subtile and mischievous Fiend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1649: he Commenced <hi>Bachiler of Arts,</hi> after which he went into <note place="margin">He is Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheler of Arts. Ordained.</note> the Countrey, and spent part of a Year among his Friends, and in visiting some Neighbour Congregations where the Ministry of the Word was wanting. The same Year he was Ordained Minister at <hi>Whitchurch</hi> in <hi>Shropshire;</hi> before which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged all the Prayers that possibly he could, not only of Friends near-hand, but of some that were far distant, for a Blessing upon that Ordinance: And when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how <hi>Pathetically</hi> he engaged them (Thus in one of his Letters: <hi>Pray and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for us)</hi> what a conjuration of Prayers there was in several places upon that Day, and the rich Crop, and Harvest reaped afterwards, surely it deserves the reflection of those Ministers, who never won a Soul to <hi>Christ,</hi> from what Principles, in what manner, and for what ends they first entred into this surest Function.</p>
               <p>Though he was not disposed for the present to settle in any place, yet was he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go about his work without Ordination; and that which induced him to continue unfixed for a space, was his enlarged desire to do good to Souls, and that not only of his Kindred and Friends, but also of all Neigbours so much, and so far as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> he could. He even travelled in Birth for such as had not seen his, <hi>that Christ might be formed in them:</hi> And the largness of his Heart herein was frequently expressed in his most earnest Prayers unto God for the enlarging of his Kingdom in Countys, Towns, and Families, which he would name with the greatest Affections both in his Prayers and Letters, oft crying out, <hi>O that all</hi> Staffordshire <hi>and</hi> Cheshire <hi>might be saved!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time he had Acquaintance, yea, and intimacy with all that were eminent for Piety in all places thereabouts, and his great care was to stir up the Grace of God in them. And he was extraordinarily qualified and prepared by the Lord for this work, and that in a special juncture of time when the heat of Controversies were managed by Sword, Pen, and Pulpit, which had sadly prevailed to justle out the lively Sense of the main things wherein all were agreed: And diverse Ministers were so taken off from these greater matters by other work which the Enemy had found them, that to Preach Death and Judgment, of <hi>Christ</hi> and Conversion were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most new things to many of the People. But this good Man was singularily fitted, to recal that great Work back again into the Hearts and Hands of his Brethren, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self having never engaged into the Controversies of Church or State: And set out with all his might upon the main things, and did promote and drive on the Work of Conversion where ever he came.</p>
               <p>And truly his Success was great: For in his Fathers Family in <hi>Seabridg,</hi> the Lord made him eminently instrumental in the Conversion of his three Sisters. His Parents too greatly favoured the wayes of God: and much furthered him in his work, and were chearful entertainers of such good People as upon sundry Occasions resorted thither: And there was such an habituated course of gracious Converse set up in the Family, by his staying with them the first Year; that an eminent Minister at his first coming thither, beholding their Order, Zeal, and forwardness in <hi>Christ,</hi> could not forbear to insist the next Day upon those words of <hi>Moses, Numb.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>Enviest thou for my sake?</hi> Which was the result of that dealing, he was forced to with his own Heart upon that occasion. And this Oyntment upon <hi>Aarons</hi> Head, ran down to the Skirts of his Cloathing: For he was a precious Savour to the very poor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of his Father's House, with whom he was unweariedly importunate to labour for Holiness, and he prevailed with some of them, which was a notable presage of the future success of his Ministry upon others.</p>
               <p>Himself takes occasion to write thus concerning his Father: <hi>My Father</hi> John Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62667:65"/>
                  <hi>did more for our Family than his Progenitors, building both the House and Barns from the Ground,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But most of all he may be remembred for bringing up me his Son to, and at the Ʋniversity, who was (through grace instrumental to bring the Gospel in its power into our Family, which was more Glory to the same then if the Materials of the House had been all turned into pure Gold, whereof let these Scriptures</hi> (upon the Chimny Stone in the Parlour) <hi>be Witnesses, where it may be said, Blessed be he and they who brought his Name hither to Record it. To God alone be the whole Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scriptures upon that Stone were these: <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 15-22. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 7-42. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18.-25. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 10-20. <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 1. 12.-19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. 35. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 14, 15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 34. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9.</p>
               <p>His usual way after Preaching was to Repeat, and to assemble together as many as <note place="margin">Industry.</note> he could to the Place where he lodged, and their to spend as much time as he was able, in pressing things farther upon them, and in holy and pertinent Discourses, with unspeakable heat and vigour; which made one of his Kindred say, <hi>That he liked his Cosin</hi> Machin <hi>well, but that he made his House a Chapple when he came to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this time he was unfixed, as himself wrote to a Friend of his in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> thus: <hi>I am yet placeless, Charities Servant, desired to many Places, but in part resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Charity to Souls.</note>
                  <hi>to fix at</hi> Ashburn <hi>for every other</hi> Sabbath, <hi>reserving the other for the service of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesity and Charity, which may be found in these Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this he did accordinly, as himself hath left upon Record. <hi>In the beginning of the year,</hi> 1650. (saith he) <hi>I was called to</hi> Ashburn <hi>in</hi> Darby<hi>-shire, where God was with me two Years, and though my labours were not in the Town so successful as I desired, yet I had God's presence much comforting my Soul, and the Souls of many Christian Friends there about.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During his abode there he was with a <hi>Quaker</hi> upon his Death-bed (presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">A Quaker.</note> the springing up of that Sect in <hi>Stafford-</hi>shire) and the more earnestly he prayed with the sick Person, the more he raged: which was an Argument to him, and to several other of the Company then present that <hi>Quakerism</hi> was a <hi>Degree of Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst he continued at <hi>Ashburn</hi> he was a painful and laborious Preacher, and very useful, and all his spare Dayes he laid out to the utmost advantage of the Gospel, by forecasting for Heavenly work in the <hi>Moor-lands,</hi> and other dark Corners in <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> where the Gospel in the power of it, had scarce ever come before: So that he might truly say, with St. <hi>Paul, that he gloried not in another Mans Line:</hi> he sowed where few had effectually sowed before, nor did they then but by his procurement. There was no Man like minded in those Parts, who did so naturally care for the state of Souls: For indeed, <hi>he sought not his own, but the things of</hi> Jesus Christ. His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> was, to engage his Brethren in the Ministry that were intimate with him, and that knew the sincerity of his Heart, and his gracious Design herein, to meet him in those Parts, and to Preach at several places near to each other, sometimes Three or Four Dayes together: And the People were ordinarily so tractable, that they (to his great Joy) would flock from place to place after the means of Grace: and he had the comfortable Testimony of God's approving his Work, in the great good that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls received thereby.</p>
               <p>See his heavenly Spirit by this Letter which he wrote to one of the Ministers Wives that thought her Husband too long from her, when he was imployed with him in this work, in <hi>July, Anno Christi,</hi> 1652. <note place="margin">Heavenly-mindedness</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My dear Friend</hi> (saith he) <hi>I do heartily bless our God for what he hath done for you and especially for your Soul. I pray you believe that you heard these words following as coming out of the Mouth which first spake them,</hi> Psal. 27. 14. Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thy Heart. Wait, I say, on the Lord: <hi>And say in Faith as you may in his Language also,</hi> Psal. 138. 8. The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me: Thy mercy, O Lord endureth for ever, <hi>&amp;c. It is to me a great sign what the Lord hath done for you, that you are so willing to part with your (I know) dear Husband, for the Lord's sake, and his works sake, but He is, and it is worthy. Think still it is to the Lord: and should a Husband be between a gracious Heart, and Christ our Lord? God forbid that we should think so, who have had already in Hand for every Step, Word, and Thought for him, from him more weight and worth, then a Wedg of</hi> Ophir's <hi>Gold, besides those Thousands of Years in Glory, which are yet in Reversion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And werein I cannot thank you and him, my Lord shall: For else his Words fail, and I will complain, as</hi> Heb. 6. 18. 2 Chron. 25. 9.</p>

               <p> After two Years stay at <hi>Ashburn,</hi> the Lord cut out work for him elsewhere; and he saw no reasons why he might not part from them: Concerning which he thus <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Atherston.</hi>
                  </note> writes. <hi>From</hi> Ashburn <hi>I was called to</hi> Atherston <hi>in</hi> Warwick<hi>-shire, where I spent one Year in a Lecturers place, and the Lord did abundantly Crown my poor pains on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Conversion-work, which made me say, as</hi> Cant. 6. 12. Or ever I was aware my Soul made me like the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab. But I saw not the Lord's mind, and will to continue me there, in which I saw the Lord's, and for the time was content; for I wanted nothing, having a</hi> Seabrig<hi>-home for supply: And I had my Hearts desire in</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This Year was the time wherein he should have Commenced <hi>Master of Arts,</hi> which also he inclined to do, chiefly to give Testimony of his respect to Learning, and the Schools thereof, in a time wherein too many decryed them: But his Estate being enough to make him a <hi>Compounder,</hi> whereby some Extraordinary charges would be expected from him; more then he could well spare: And with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration he sat down, thinking that he might imploy that money more to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and the Gospel, then to part with it for the Honour of a Degree, though he could willingly have been at the single charge upon the former account.</p>
               <p>Concerning his Remove to <hi>Astbury</hi> in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> himself thus writes: <hi>I was ordered, and</hi>

               <p>About this time his Father Died, of which he thus saith; <hi>He Died</hi> March <hi>the</hi> 12th. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no <note place="margin">His Fathers Death.</note> Christi 1652. <hi>Being the</hi> Sabbath Day, <hi>about Ten of the Clock at Night, and in the 55th year of his Age, with these words in his mouth,</hi> (Psal. 39. 5.) <hi>Behold thou hast made my Daies as an hand-breadth, and mine Age is as nothing before thee.

               </p>
               <p>He wisely observed, when such an unthought of loss befel him, how he was employed▪ at that instant; concerning which he saith; <hi>At the time when my Father Died I was at Prayer, and that with the most remarkable impressions I ever had, both in pleading for mercy for him, and on a sudden I submitted to the Lord's Determination.</hi> Many observable warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he had from the Lord of this Event before it came to pass: As, his serious and solemn Exposition, and Application of that portion of Scripture, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 23, 24. in the Family, before any <hi>Sickness</hi> appeared <hi>(March</hi> the 9th.) Secondly, His earnestness to know the state of his Fathers Soul before they parted the next morning: As also to thank him for his Love and Care in his behalf, and to understand his Mind and Will concerning himself and his outward Estate, whilst he yet continued in perfect health. Thirdly, The Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, having occasion to send home, he, by the Messenger, recommended to his Father that Scripture, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 1, 2, 3. These, with several other notable passages, and pious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements he made hereof, which gave him hopes that the sad Providence was in Love to him, and in mercy to his Father, unto whom he could not come time enough to see him in the Land of the Living.</p>
               <p>Not long after he removed to <hi>Astbury,</hi> and changed his condition, concerning which himself thus writes: <hi>The good Hand of my everloving Father, so disposing it, I had some Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He Marries.</note>
                  <hi>in</hi> Derbyshire, <hi>and I especially found one forward in the Profession at</hi> Mickleaver, <hi>near</hi> Darby, <hi>who might be to me as</hi> Rebecca <hi>was to</hi> Isaac, <hi>by Name,</hi> Jane Butler <hi>(Daughter to</hi> John Butler) <hi>on whom my Thoughts much settled, with submission to my heavenly Father's Will, and she became my Wife,</hi> Septemb. 29. Anno Christi 1653. <hi>at</hi> Utoxeter; <hi>whom God gave to me, and with her what I expected in an humble, gracious Woman,</hi> (Prov. 31. 11, 12. &amp; 29. 30, 31.) <hi>Her price was above Rubies; her portion of outward Estate very considerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His managing of this weighty business, was in such an holy and heavenly manner, that all their meetings on that account were improved to the utmost advantage of both their Souls; and their Marriage was fixed upon one of his Lecture-Daies, where two of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Preached, and joyned in the solemnization thereof. And after two Daies stay with his Wife, he went a long Journey about the work of the Lord for many Daies following, whereby he made it evident how much the greatest worldly comforts were made subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to God's Glory and Interest, and were so far from hindering, that he was rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and fitted thereby to walk in the Waies of God.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:62667:66"/>
               <p> His first contrivance of setting up a Lecture, was some months before his Fathers Death; <note place="margin">A Lecture set up.</note> and no sooner was the Estate fallen into his hands, but he resolved to consecrate a share of it to God, and would not serve the Lord with that which cost him nothing His intentions about it, himself thus expresses; <hi>I intend a monthly Lecture to be Preached in these following Towns of greatest concourse;</hi> viz. <hi>in</hi> New-Castle, Leek, Utoxiter, Lichfield, Tamworth, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal, Wolverhampton, Pencridge, Stafford, Eccleshall, Stone, Muckleston, <hi>in the County of</hi> Stafford, <hi>the last</hi> Friday <hi>in each month, allowing (of the Lord's fulness in my hands) thirteen shillings and four pence to the Ministers that Preach, to convert Souls, and one Shilling to be</hi>

                  <hi>given to twelve of the Poorest People that come to Church: In all eight pounds twelve Shillings a year. This was the resolution of an heart engaged to him; of one that would honour the Lord with his Substance, and is</hi> J. M. July 31. Anno Christi 1652.</p>
               <p>And presently after his Fathers Death he thus wrote concerning this business: <hi>I believe that the Lord could have given him more Daies; but yet do will that</hi> 8 l. per Annum <hi>for</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeal.</note>
                  <hi>ever be set apart for the Gospel, out of mine own Estate, that Immortal Souls may be won, and God's Portion in the World be encreased, to be disposed as aforesaid, or as my Brethren, Mr.</hi> N. <hi>and Mr.</hi> S. <hi>my Dearest Fellow-Labourers shall judge, and find most abundantly and effectually to accomplish Christ's end and mine,</hi> saying, as <hi>(Rom.</hi> 10. 1.) <hi>My heart's desire and prayer to God for</hi> Israel <hi>is, that they might be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Lecture he set on foot this Summer. The first Day was at <hi>New-Castle, Aug.</hi> 4. 1653. where his two aforesaid Friends did Preach: As also the third course at <hi>Utoxiter Sept.</hi> 29. following, being the Day of his Marriage. And this business was so much in his Heart and purpose, that when some scruple was made about it in the settlement of his Land at Marriage, he wrote thus: <hi>Whether I change my condition or not, I have cause, and I call to mind my Promise to the Lord and his Gospel in the thing I intended, which I think will now be preferred before the change of my condition.</hi>

               <p>And that the Holiness of his Heart, and bent of his Soul in this business may appear, he inserted these passages into his <hi>Will,</hi> which he made <hi>Novemb.</hi> 16. 1653. not two months <note place="margin">His Will.</note> after his Marriage, he thus writes: <hi>I commit my Soul to God, my God, and my Saviour, that Created, and Redeemed it, even into the Bosom of the Father of Spirits: My Body to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Corruption, and to the Worms my Mother and Sister,</hi> (Job 17. 14.) <hi>In hopes that he will make good to me (who with them have sometimes endeavoured to serve him) his Promise of Eternal Life,</hi> Rom. 2. 7. <hi>As for my Dear Beloved Wife, I freely return (and I pray it may be with advantage) to him who hath lent her, to whom I leave,</hi> Joh. 17. 24. Rev. 21. <hi>last.</hi> Jude 24. Psal. 84. 10, 11. <hi>Hoping that I leave her an Heir together with me, or rather with</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>of a Kingdom that cannot be removed. If the Lord shall graciously give me Issue (I pray it may be of his Herîtage, and prepared for a Room in Heaven) to it I would leave,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9. <hi>and I pray God see it executed according to my Will. And it is my willconcerning my Heir (if the Lord give one) that he may be a</hi> Samuel, <hi>lent to the Lord, and his Service in the Ministry: For I can say, he is an Asking of the Lord, as was</hi> Samuel: <hi>And that he may have mine Inheritance, performing my</hi> Will <hi>concerning my</hi> Lecture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And concludes thus; <hi>Praying, that whoever rules here, may keep open House for God and his People, to whom I would in Faith say,</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 5.

               <p>And in a <hi>Schedule</hi> of the same Date, he writes as followeth: <hi>Some particulars concerning the thing that hath long been in my Heart to do for God, written as my last Will, as an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some standing Service when I am not. The Motives are God's Glory; Christ's Kingdoms encrease; and Poor Souls Salvation; an expression of my Thankfulness, for what God hath done for our Family, and for me the least and last of it. And the rather, because I am here, in mine own apprehension so little serviceable in speaking, doing, and suffering for him, and nothing at all advantagious in Writing, as others have been, and I could have desired. These Motives, together with that blessed Experience I have had of its advantage already, through God's sealing work with it, makes me to think my self favoured more of God, if I may do this for him: and I doubt not but he can and will, if need be, give me and mine, much more than this;</hi> as is said, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 9. <hi>And if I could say as</hi> David, 1 Chron. 29. 13, <hi>&amp;c. I would think it little betwixt him and me, who hath said;</hi> Whosoever shall give a Cup of cold Water to drink in my Name, because ye belong to <hi>Christ,</hi> verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. <hi>And my prayer is, that those which come after me (whose it might have been) may think that it's better bestowed than the rest.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This Lecture by his constant cost and care, he kept up from <hi>August</hi> the Fourth, <note place="margin">Lecture laid down:</note>
                  <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1653. Monthly, until <hi>January</hi> the Second, 1659. Whereof he kept an exact account in a <hi>Catalogue,</hi> wherein he took notice of the Day of the Month, the Place, the Persons that Preached, and their Texts, with some hints of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, their number, and seriousness: And he continued it, until the times would neither encourage, nor bear it, and thereupon it not only fell, but also (wanting Publick Liberty for such an Exercise, according to the purpose of his Heart) he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended his intensions, and disposed his Land otherwise.</p>
               <p>In <hi>May, Anno Christi,</hi> 1654: He began to keep House at <hi>Astbury,</hi> concerning which, he thus saith: <hi>I was intertained without exception, or interruption: And though for some Years we met with troubles, yet did the Lord stand between me, and all my troubles, so that many times I was as a Man wholly free, and was made amends for all my Sufferings of that Nature, by the Lord's Presence, sweet and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.</note>
                  <hi>powerful in his Ordinances, especially in that of the</hi> Lord<hi>'s</hi> Supper, <hi>which was there set on Foot in</hi> March, Anno Christi, 1654: <hi>and continued without interruption Monthly, or once in six Weeks till,</hi> Anno Christi, 1660.</p>
               <p>The Lord did mightily strengthen his Hands and encourage his Heart in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and he took great care in Preparation for it, spending the <hi>Friday</hi> before the Sacrament in Publick Prayers and Preaching God's Words, and the Day after the <note place="margin">Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> Sacrament in Thanksgiving, in his own, or in some Neighbours Family, especially where there fell out in any Communicants Family, any occasion of special Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: As recovery from Sickness, or the like.</p>
               <p>By the coming of another <hi>Incumbent</hi> unto <hi>Astbury,</hi> he had only oportunity of Preaching there each other <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day,</hi> and for the other he had liberty to Preach abroad upon Charity, which yet he heartily rejoiced in, and was ready freely to help <note place="margin">Fasts.</note> any of his Brethren, so that he was seldom a Day at ease. And now he had oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being acquainted with the Ministers and Congregations in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> where <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> the Lord blessed his labours to the benefit of many Souls.</p>
               <p>His labours here were much encreased by his assisting in many <hi>Fast-days</hi> unto which he was very ready, and would gather up such special things as any in or out of his Family desired to be recommended unto God in Prayer upon such days, &amp; would press such as were present to perticularize their special things, that they might not come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God upon an uncertain Errand, which things he would usualy write down in a Paper, that so they which assisted in the duty might read it, and so be the better enabled pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Pray one for another. He did much desire to make these and all other Ordinances very serious, and to rescue them from that formality which two frequently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them, being little satisfied with the work done, unless he found somthing done thereby upon his own, and the Hearts of others. He knew that great benifit and comfort was to be had in these Duties and Ordinances, and he would not rest contented without it. He diligently also observed the success of them, and if God at any time with drew himself from him, he made it his Business to seek his God till he found him again, as also the Cause of his with-drawings.</p>
               <p>What strong Affections he had in the Duties of God's Worship was manifest to all <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> that joined with him, that they might easily see and discern the ardency of them; especially in singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> which he did with such apparent intension of of mind, and Heart as is not ordinary, and diverse yet living cannot but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with what Faith and fervency he would pronounce <hi>Amen, Amen</hi> at the end of every Prayer. And after holy Duties usually his Heart was greatly lifted up in the wayes of God: And though he sped never so well in it, yet he had not done with an Ordinance when it was over, but had both Heart and Art of improving it, and would then dexterously put on to holy Discourses: and not only Publickly urg things for fashion sake, but would afterwards follow it with all his might, as if (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord's Ambassador) he waited for an answer to him that had sent him.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62667:67"/>
               <p> He was most unwearied and indefatigable in holy Duties, and was never observed <note place="margin">Prayers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> to give out in them, though somtimes upon special Occasions, they continued all Night therein. After one of these Dayes of special Communion with God he, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with two or three of his choice Friends, retired into private, and there he urged each of them to name some one thing that they would cheifly beg of God, and so each of them prayed over those particulars, and what impressions and affections were then raised in their Hearts cannot be forgotten: Also to promote and encrease Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Holiness, he help up a <hi>Conference,</hi> both to his own and his Peoples great Benefit; and that no time might be lost, nor any ones Mite be neglected, he would take the Answers of those that were absent at the appointed times, as occasionaly <note place="margin">Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> he met with them, and somtimes before the whole Assembly were met together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Dayes of Prayer, so that he was always doing, and designing the best advantage of the Peoples Souls upon all occasions.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was Minister at <hi>Astbury</hi> it pleased the Lord to give him four or five Children, concerning whose Birth, he thus writes in his <hi>Memorials: The first Will I made was presently after our Marriage, and in it I spake of a Son</hi> Samuel, <hi>as if I had seen him by Faith, though he was not then in being, and it was full a Quarter of a Year, before we had any sensible hopes of a Child, which was given us about</hi> March <hi>the 9th.</hi> 1653. <hi>In</hi> May <hi>following we began Houskeeping at</hi> Astbury, <hi>we received the Birth of our asking of God,</hi> (1 Sam. 1. 20.) Samuel, <hi>who was Born,</hi> November <hi>the 13th. chiefly called</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, <hi>because he was asked of God by Father, Mother, and many Christian Friends there and elsewhere, with great Ends propounded at such times of Prayer: Namely, that he might be one to bere God's Name hear in his Church on Earth, and one to take up a Room prepared for him in Glory: The Lord be Surety for thee my Son: The Lord forbid thou should'st come short of these ends: Prayeth thy Father.</hi> Thus did he set upon his Head the Remembrance of the Mercy of God in his Birth, as the Servants of God of old did make the very Names of their Children the means of remembring the Signal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <note place="margin">Prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</note> of God to them: This Child in the first Year of his Life, was, by Sickness, twice under the Sentence of Death, but Prayer that obtained him recovered him.</p>
               <p>An other great Deliverance to this Child he thus Recordeth: <hi>Memorandum</hi> (saith he) <hi>that</hi> July <hi>the 10th</hi> 1656. <hi>the Lord prevented the Death of my Son</hi> Samuel, <hi>which</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces special</note>
                  <hi>in all probability might have been with my own Hand, bowling a Stone with all my might to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Child</hi> (whether I saw him before it went out of my Hand I know not) <hi>But it's motion was directly towards his Face, coming up the steps in the Garden-walk; and the visible means of prevention in God's Hand was an other Stone, that turned it out of the way a few steps before it came to the Child. This was an awakening Providence to me and my Wife, and sent us to God on our Knees, partly for Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, partly for Gratulation.</hi> This Stone he kept in his Study, and (without Superstition) made it his Remembrancer to continue his Thankfulness to God for this great Deliverance. Some such observations he recorded about his other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Birth and Names.</p>
               <p>When this Winter was ended, he removed to <hi>Whitley, Anno Christi,</hi> 1661. <hi>May 17th:</hi> And of his success there he gives this account: <hi>After somtime I found that God was with me in his Ordinances, to make Conversion-work: And in Providences, to prevent evil, and to reach good things to us. Let it be remembred to his Praise, that</hi> October <hi>the</hi> 23<hi>d.</hi> 1661. <hi>my Son</hi> John <hi>was within a step of drowning, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ordered me to be within sight at that very time, though I had been from home the Fortnight before, And not an Hour after my Daughter</hi> Sarah <hi>was almost choked with a Thred, to our great affrightment: But we saw the Lord's Hand very notably in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, as we had done the Spring before from Sickness, in answer to Prayers,</hi> Psal. 103. 4.</p>
               <p>An other merciful Preservation of his Son <hi>John</hi> he thus Records. <hi>Memorandum, that our Son</hi> John <hi>had a notable escape from drowning as he and his Brother were coming from School,</hi> June <hi>the 18th.</hi> 1664. <hi>But Blessed be God who is present when Parents are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this Place he continued to labour in the Lord's Vineyard till that <hi>black Day, August</hi> 24. 1662: at which time, he with very many of his Brethren were Civilly slain, being unsatisfied to conform as the <hi>Act of Ʋniformity</hi> then required. But no Man suffered his Death with less Reflection upon Superiors, or with more grief for so sad a dispensation. Yet there he continued, labouring for the advantage of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62667:67"/> Peoples Souls with all his Strength, and the Lord made him a great Blessing to all the Country round about: And God's Providence so ordered it, that the Neighbouring Gentry (though of a differing Perswasion, yet) offered nor to molest him at all, being convinced of the Innocence and Peaceableness of his Spirit, and of the uprightness of his Ends therein.</p>
               <p>Before I give an account of the last part of his Life, you may take this just Character of him. <note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He was of an excellent Spirit in <hi>Solomons</hi> sense, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 27. as slow to passion, as most have been known. One that lived some time with him, gave this testimony, that he <note place="margin">Patience.</note> remembred not that he ever saw him transported with Passion; but angry he would be at Sin, yet still after the example of his Lord and Master, <hi>Grieved for the hardness of their Hearts, Mark</hi> 3. 5. His Reproofs were always so moderated and mixed with Love and Compassion, that the Offender could not but see, that his great aim was at his good. <note place="margin">Prudence.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He had good Natural Parts, and was no <hi>Novice</hi> in any of that Learning that might <note place="margin">Learning.</note> fit and qualify him for his Work. For tho he was more abundant in publick Preaching than most of his Brethren, which must needs hinder his Private Studies, yet what time of vacancy he had from this Work, he carefully redeemed for his Book, and took in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> the <hi>Tongues, History, Positive,</hi> and <hi>Practical Divinity</hi> in the course of his Studies, being never well unless at his Study, or in secret Duties, or holy Conference, tho (as it was once said of <note place="margin">Industry.</note>
                  <hi>Plato</hi>'s Houshold-stuff) it may be truly said of all his studies, there was <hi>Nihil in Pompam, Omne in Usum;</hi> nothing for Pomp, all for use. And like of one of the <hi>Architects</hi> in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> who, when another, had made an Artificial Discourse of his dexterity to contrive a new Building before those who were to make their choice of them; He only said, <hi>All that this Man hath said, I can do:</hi> So this Holy Man had the knowledge of doing, what others could learnedly Dispute and Discourse of: he could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>earnedly live in every point as became a Learned Preacher.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He had an extraordinary Measure of Holiness and Heavenly mindedness, according <note place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to the observation which a judicious Divine sometimes made of him; <hi>That he had more than ordinary Degrees of Sanctification.</hi> He was of a <hi>quick understanding in the fear of the Lord,</hi> and had the <hi>Tongue of the Learned to speak a word in Season</hi> to the State of all Souls.</p>
               <p>This indeed was his Master-piece, and was become natural to him. He had a singular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in improving Scripture <hi>Similitudes,</hi> and indeed every thing that did occur, with unimaginable dexterity: every Tree, and Bird, and Stone would be a Text, upon which he would aptly enlarge himself, having an admirable wit to spiritualize every thing, and to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion of profitable discourse in all companies, and almost upon every Subject, and it did clearly appear, <hi>That out of the abundance of his Heart his Mouth spake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had a great Holy Jealousy and Fear of himself: A dear Friend, that knew him well wrires thus of him. <hi>Never was any Man more watchful against Relapses, nor more jealous</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Holy Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie.</note>
                  <hi>to maintain his first love to the height, I have</hi> (saith he) <hi>sometimes told him that it was not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual for converts to retain that Land stood of Comfort, that intension of Zeal, and extension of Affection which flourished so in him, and was preserved in the height: and therefore must he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an abatement in time, and the current thereof to be contracted, and setled in a narrower Channel.</hi> He is his Letters often reflected on these words, <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> intimating that he still was what he was before, not without admiring God's Grace to him, whereunto he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed <note place="margin">Humility.</note> all that he was. And indeed he was so habituated to Spiritual Communion with his God, that he could not with Patience endure his withdrawings: And he was far more sensible, and sooner aware of it than many others are, that can, to their great loss and prejudice, entertain other Delights instead of God's Face and Favour: But this holy Man did most eagerly seek, upon all occasions for him <hi>whom his Soul loved,</hi> and would not be satisfied till he found him.</p>
               <p>He was a great Observer of the frame, and bent of his Heart at all times. A worthy <note place="margin">Christan watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Minister writes thus of him. <hi>I</hi> (saith he) <hi>have admired at the constant frame of his Spirit. He was not subject to that deadness and indisposedness, which other good Men seem to be troubled with: His Heart was continually burning with an holy Zeal.</hi> Take a taste of the excellent sweet frame of his Heart in this short passage in a Letter to a Friend: <hi>My dear, dear, dear Brother, I pray thee report the loving kindness of the Lord unexpressible, unto a poor, vile, empty, altogether undeserving Worm: For I have found an Answer this Day; this Day more then ever to our Prayers, and can say, The Lord's work</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Humility.</note>
                  <hi>will on, tho Hell, say No: And still Believe, Preach: Pray and Believe</hi> (Lam. 3. 25.) <hi>I am constrained to say as,</hi> Isa. 63. 7. <hi>Neither thou, nor any of my Friends can conceive</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:62667:68"/>
                  <hi>how good the Lord is to me, even to me. I pray thee and others think and study how good he is to me, to me, to me!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He kept a constant watch over his Thoughts, especially over his last Thoughts <note place="margin">His watch</note> which slept with him, and his first Thoughts which he awaked with, and usually they were some precious portion of Scripture or other, which he would Discourse of with his Friends, with great content and chearfulness.</p>
               <p>He kept a <hi>Diary</hi> of his Life which he wrote in <hi>Characters</hi> where ever he came, <note place="margin">A Diary.</note> wherein he set down what Scriptures he found most sweetness from; what was the state of his Soul towards God; and such other remarkable passages as did occur each Day, from the Year 1650. to the Year wherein he died.</p>
               <p>His Love to the Word of God was <hi>Superlative:</hi> It was his <hi>Meditation Day and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Love to the Word.</note>
                  <hi>Night.</hi> Constantly every Morning he used to pitch upon some Verse, which he would endeavour to fix upon his Heart, and was ever unwilling to leave it, till he had sucked some sweetness, and Spiritual nourishment from it: by Meditation he was often chewing up the 119 <hi>Psalm,</hi> especially in the time of his sickness, daily draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ture of one Verse into his Soul, as appears by his <hi>Diary.</hi> And this he did, not formally as a Task, but with that effectuall seriousness and relish, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at home, and his Friends abroad (by his Letters) might easily perceive what dainties he had been feeding upon. And at every vacant time he would be looking for a Word, and would find out by his casual turning down of a Leaf in his <hi>Bible,</hi> (which was his way) such passages as were very remakable, and not observed by him before. A Scripture thus met with was as Food to him, exceeding sweet to his Taste: He would make much of it, and usually would not leave it till he had improved it to the good and benefit of others; either by speaking or writing; endeavouring that others might see what he saw, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

               <p>An other Practice he had also wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> shewed him to be both a good <hi>Textuary, and a good Christian,</hi> and that was usually to take leave of his Friends and Relations, by leaving some Scriptures with them, and those, such as were most suitable to their condition. Nay, he hardly sent commendations to a Friend but it was accompanied with some pertinent Text of Scripture, so that he seemed, to breath no other Air but that of Scripture. His <hi>Bible</hi> was his constant Companion in the Day, and usually his Pillow at Night: and many scores of lively, <hi>Emphatical</hi> Expressions he had found <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> therein, which his constant reading, and diligence of others could never light on. And where ever he came, he would engrave some Scripture or others upon the Chimny-pieces, Walls, and Trees, which was so constant, and peculiar a course with him, that his Acquaintance knew well that he had been in such a Place, by the Marks which he ordinarily thus left behind him: His delign herein being to do good to Souls; that the very novelty of seeing such things might set People upon enquiring and looking on those Texts in their <hi>Bibles,</hi> not knowing what good one such Verse of the Scripture might do, God setting it on.</p>
               <p>At least he found this advantage to himself, that when he came to a review of them, he was put in mind of that frame of Heart he had when he wrote those things, and so might taste over again what he before felt in those passages of the Word of God: He sedom wrote a Note or Letter but he concluded with some suitable Text of Scripture <hi>(the Word of God dwelling plentifully in him.)</hi> And in the <hi>Memorials</hi> before mentioned, he intermixed them with Scriptures upon every occasion, adding in the Conclusion, The Texts of Scripture herein mentioned, are best worth thy finding, and noteing in thy Life, as they were in mine.</p>
               <p>His Moderation to all sorts of godly People, though of differing Perswasions, was remarkable: his Heart and heat being wholly taken up with the great and necessary <note place="margin">His Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> Points in Religion which all true Christians agree in: And, making the Substance of Religion, his work and business, he never had leisure, or pleasure to trouble himself with controverted Circumstances, nor would put his Soul out of tune with such things as had caused such jarrings and discord among Christians. He was never (or very seldom, and then not out of choice) heard to Discourse of the dividing Conrtoversies of the times.</p>
               <p>He was exercised with a peculiar Tryal soon after his entrance into the Ministry, <note place="margin">Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and that was by strong, and horrible apprehensions in the Night season, as if he were cut in pieces with Knives, or the like, and he was in as real Agonies, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress as if he had felt the pain of such Torments indeed. This he apprehended to be the <hi>Buffetings of Satan:</hi> They used to follow Dayes of great pains, or Dayes of great
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62667:68"/> inward Comforts, and he was often forced by them to leap out of his Bed in the Night, and to betake himself to Prayer for ease and delivery. He would very <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically</hi> bewail those gloomy Nights, and (what cause so ever they proceeded from) they were great occasions to realize the apprehensions of Hell to him, and to keep him humble.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In his <hi>Relative Duties</hi> he was abundantly Diligent and Faithful.</p>
               <p>First, In his Family; <hi>he walked in a perfect way in the midst of his House.</hi> There he constantly read the holy Scriptures: A portion of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> in the Morning, and of the <hi>New Testament</hi> in the Evening, and sung some Verses of the <hi>Psalms</hi> in Order.</p>
               <p>After Reading, he examined every a one what they Remembred and Observed out <note place="margin">Family Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> of the Chapter, and would open and enlarge upon each Portion, and tell them what was most observable and Practical in that Scripture. Neither did he consine Religion to these Family Duties (as too many do, who from Morning to Evening Prayer scarce ever think or speak of Spiritual things) but he familiarized holy Descourse in his House all the Day long as there was any occasion and oportunity. He alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated at home the Sermons which he heard abroad. The <hi>Lord's Day</hi> Sermon he used to repeat the <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Afternoon following, or some other Sermon as a preparation to the <hi>Sabbath</hi> following. Upon the Evening of the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> he would take his Children in private, and their instruct them and teach them how to pray.</p>
               <p>He constantly <hi>Catechized</hi> his Children and Servants twice in the Week, and caused <note place="margin">Fasts.</note> them to get some Verses of Scripture by Heart, and also part of their <hi>Catechisms</hi> every day. He had often private Fasts with his Family alone, and was frequent in secret Humuliation also. His ardent desires aften the Sanctification and Salvation of his Children, and Kindred, was farther evident by a Discourse which he wrote for his Son, upon 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. And an other which he called <hi>A Word to my meer Natural Friends</hi> upon <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 7. wherein the precious breathings of his Soul after their Spirirtual and Eternal welfare are largly manifested: And upon the same account he gave Twenty of Mr. <hi>Baxter's Call to the Ʋnconverted,</hi> among his Kindred and Servants, in diverse of which he framed and wrote such pertinent <hi>Dialogues</hi> as were most suitable to the State of their Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly,</hi> In his Ministry he was indefatigable. He was in Labours oft: In Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings <note place="margin">His Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</note> oft. So that we may truly apply to him what the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said of <hi>Timothy, Phil.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>We have no Man like minded that doth naturally care for the State of Souls.</hi> His great forwardness and earness in this Work: his travelling, and toiling, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing all the help he could for the carrying on this Work, could not have been more if he had forseen the shortness of his own Days, or the length of our Night. And the more universal was the influence of his Labours, in that he was strangly stirred up to Preach in several parts of the County. Both Ministers and People generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting and accepting his holy and sincere Endeavours, where Envy or Prejudice did not manifestly interpose.</p>
               <p>When other Ministers, or himself have been imployed in the usual Courses of the <note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> Day, he would often choose rather to stay and Repeat the Morning Sermon to the people at Noon, then go to his Dinner, according to the Example of his dear Master before him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 33, 34. And indeed his Zeal for the work of God would carry him to do more then the strength of his Body, and the convenience of the people could well bear: But as it was sincerely meant by him, so it was generally well taken by them, and God made it answerably beneficial in the event.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Latimer</hi> having sharply reproved some great Offenders in his time, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of for lack of <hi>Discretion,</hi> which he hearing of, said, <hi>He was glad they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to charg him with but want of Discretion, it being evident thereby that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Reproof was true:</hi> So all that could be charged upon this worthy Man of God was, that somtimes he wanted Prudence in the length and frequency of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. A thing for which he might be well excused, seeing so few transgress in that kind.</p>
               <p>This good Man, such was his heavenly Spirit and Way in his work, that though <note place="margin">Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> the matter he brought was ordinary, yet the manner that he delivered it in, was not ordinary, and he had great success in the Conversion of many Souls: One that knew him well, and oft accompanied him when he went abroad, saith thus: <hi>I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get how the People after Sermons would meet him with Tears in their Eyes, some following him, others thanking him for his pain, and shewing by their very Countenances that they</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62667:69"/>
                  <hi>had met with God in the Ordinances:</hi> And it's certain, that he that <hi>winneth Souls is wise.</hi> If that great Man on his Death-bed could profess, That one Soul converted by his means, ministred more Honour and Comfort to him, then all the Honour and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur which he had enjoyed; with what Glory is this holy Man gone off the Stage, who was an Instrument in the Hand of God's Spirit, to convert many, and to convince and quicken more.</p>
               <p>His converse was a continual Sermon (as was old Mr. <hi>Dods;)</hi> he never went <note place="margin">Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> abroad but the Minister and the warm-hearted Christian went along with him. He was the same out of the Pulpit as he was in it, and a lively Comment upon those words of the Apostle: <hi>Let your Speech be alwayes seasoned with Salt, that it may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Grace to the Hearers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some that travelled with him many Miles, usually, upon a Religious account, have been almost ravished in their Souls with his holy and heavenly Discourses; and into whatsoever House he came, either publickly in the Family, or privately in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he would go to Prayer.</p>
               <p>He was undauntedly bold in reproving Sin: Many that accompanied him in his Journeys, when in the Inn he hath heard any one Swearing, have observed how he <note place="margin">Courage.</note> would Thunder against the Swearer, thus: <hi>Who was it there that durst abuse the Name of the God of Heaven?</hi> And he would ever on purpose as he talked with his Friends on the way, choose some weighty Word to utter as he met with People that passed by, that so it might stick with them; and this Bread of his that was thus cast on the Waters, would somtimes return to him after many Dayes.</p>
               <p>He had a singular presence and readiness of Heart, and Matter to speak to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he met on the way, and great condescention also to explain himself: wherein any <note place="margin">Heavenly mintled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> one did not understand him: As once on a Snowy Day, meeting suddenly with a Man driving his Horses before him, who thus saluted him; <hi>Well met Sir:</hi> I but (said Mr. <hi>Machin)</hi> we shall be better met, if we met in Heaven. Few poor People ever went from his Door without a powerful spiritual Almes, and he would order them to have larger Relief who were most ready to attend to his heavenly Counsel.</p>
               <p>He had an excellent faculty in Discoursing with People on the Way, into whom he would handsomly insinuate himself, and would deliver to them very material, and <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> yet familiar things of Eternal concernment; he would find out their Ignorance; mightily amaze and convince them, and thereby lay a happy Foundation of farther acquaintance upon this best account. And he framed diverse <hi>Dialogues</hi> on such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which are dispersed in the hands of several Friends, which (if they were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished) would shew his excellent <hi>Genius</hi> this way. One instance hereof is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>
               <p>Riding one Morning to a Lecture, he met with some young Men that were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Cocks to a Cock-fight; he overtaking them, said thus to one of them: <note place="margin">Note.</note>
                  <hi>Friend, our Lord and Master</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>never came into the World to set up such Sports as these.</hi> These Words, and some further Discourse (though the young Man went on to his Pastimes that day) stuck like an Arrow in his Side, and he could not be quiet till he had learned what Minister this was, after which he gained acquaintance with him, and so laid these and his other Sins to Heart as made a blessed change in his course of Life.</p>
               <p>He was a Zealous improver of good Society: his ordinary Visits were seldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded without Prayer before he parted with his Friends. And when diverse good <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> People were all Night together, he would engage them to pray one for another, and one after an other: and he would cause them to produce their several Evidences for Heaven. He would somtimes raise up the Company an hour before Day that they might pray and weep together, that the Fire might not go out upon the Hearth of their Souls, being by these means so constantly blown up and kept alive: yea, the very Crumbs of Piety that fell from him at his Table, were most Heavenly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing, and a plain Argument that it was his <hi>Meat and Drink to do his Fathers Will, and to finish his work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had ingenious Devises and witty Artifices (flowing from his rooted affection to God) whereby, after some solemn Dayes, he would engage his Christian Friends to a closer walking with God: Take an Instance of one or two of them, as himself left upon Record.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Seabridg, October 8th,</hi> where God's Name was that day recorded. Before the Lord, and in his strength I promise to draw near to God, believing that he will draw near to me. I pass away and part with mine own power to him, that I may be his and not an others.

               </p>
               <p>He highly esteemed the prayers of his Friends, and was a very faithful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer of them that desired his prayers; which he used to do with that heartiness, <hi>Sympathy,</hi> and enlargedness of Heart, that it would work much upon their Hearts, <note place="margin">His Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> and engage them to more seriousuess in their own business, and in Affection to him, that so kindly concerned himself in their Affairs. And he would plead with God very fervently in their absence, not only to satisfie his Conscience, and to make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of remembring them, but sought with strong cries to prevail for them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that frequent course which he held, of puting all present to tell him, before Prayer began, what they would have chiefly beg'd for them at the Throne of Grace, by which means they were sent into their own Souls, to study their present, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Condition.</p>
               <p>Concerning this a dear Friend saith thus: he gave this <hi>Rule</hi> touching praying for Friends, which I have ever since endeavoured to make my Directory in that case: <hi>Alwayes when you think of your Friends, let it be with a Praying Thought.</hi> He would <note place="margin">Note.</note> somtimes cause his intimate Friends to write down in his <hi>Day-book,</hi> what special things they should intercede for in one anothers behalf till their next meeting.</p>
               <p>His Letters were frequent and very heavenly set: He commonly set time apart for writing such Letters; and he seldom wrote about any business, but Religion was <note place="margin">His Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> interwoven, and such plenty of apt and sweet Scriptures and <hi>Postscripts,</hi> yea, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times some Texts of Scripture would be endorsed on the outside of his Letters, when they were sent by a Friends hand. In this profitable and useful part of friendship he was frequent and abundant. Probably there yet remain many Hundreds of Letters in the hands of his Friends where there was scarce a Word but about Religion.</p>
               <p>He was eminent in real Charity. He <hi>sympathized</hi> with those that were in straits and affliction, and had a ready hand to help them. He was liberal according to his <note place="margin">His Charity.</note> power, <hi>yea, and beyond his power.</hi> In his accounts to his Father from <hi>Cambridg</hi> he seldom found less then Twelvepence a Week to the Poor, besides somtimes half a Crown at a time. After his coming into the Country it was his delight to engage others, and to stir them up by his own Example in his liberal Contributions upon good occasions, giving Twenty-shillings, yea, somtimes five Pounds at a time to Charitable uses. Somtimes he would make a stock for such as were poor and pious; somtimes to help a Minister out of his straits, which hath occcasioned the Bowels of many to bless God in his behalf.</p>
               <p>To be brief; he was a Star of the first Magnitude in the impartial Judgment of those that knew him throughly. An eminent Divine, writing familiarly to him, saith
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62667:70"/> thus: <hi>Dear Brother I earnestly desire corespondence with thee: Thy Letters are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and weighty to my Soul: Thou art more in my Heart, and Eye, and Thoughts than all the Acquaintance I have in the World: I have seen that in thee that hath not a little convinced me of the Reality of Religion. These are not the Words of a Flatterer, but the overflowing of a Sincere Heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If we view him in his Natural and Moral accomplishments; in his Graces; in his Relations; in his Publick, and Private behaviour, and in his true Humilty and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, which crowned all the rest, we must needs say, That he feared God above many, and hath left but few such Ministers behind him.</p>
               <p>He was very apprehensive of his Death long before it came. In a Letter, dated <note place="margin">Death fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen.</note>
                  <hi>May,</hi> 1659: concerning an Old Disciple, he saith: <hi>Will he not let me see him before I die?</hi> And in an other in <hi>November</hi> following, he hath these Words, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 32. <hi>To which let Thoughts be directed when no more is to be seen, or heard of me, but that I am Thy Friend in store: Not lost, but laid up,</hi> J. M. And in <hi>March,</hi> 1663. He complained of frequent dejectedness and Melancholly: And this passage he had in a Letter, <hi>June</hi> 28. 1664. <hi>I have been very Melancholy some while by fits, whence this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes I know not: But the All-wise God whose ways are past finding out,</hi> knew well that the shadows of the Evening were coming upon him.</p>
               <p>As he was removing to <hi>Seabridg,</hi> he took in his way the House of a worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <note place="margin">Death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for.</note> where he treated of these Words, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 24. <hi>Neither count I life dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my self: So that I might finish my course with Joy,</hi> &amp;c. Which he studied, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as his last farewel to this World, being in a weak and sickly condition: And not long before he had made many Sermons upon <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 3, 45. which were a sweat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to Life everlasting.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Seabridg</hi> he grew worse and worse, and in the issue it proved an high Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note place="margin">His Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Feavor. Hereupon his Wife was sent for, who at her coming found him in his Bed, and he told her, that he was ill, but whether it were Life or Death he would not choose, but his Father should for him. The fit season of opening a Vein (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Physitians</hi> absence from home) was missed, and so his Distemper prevailed. Once looking his Face in the Glass, he brake out very affectionatly into these Words: <hi>Ah</hi> Adam, Adam, <hi>What hast thou done? What a beautiful, happy Creature wast thou; but now how Poor, and sorrowful art thou? Ah</hi> Adam, <hi>What hast thou done?</hi> These words greatly affected some that were with him.</p>
               <p>His Distemper grew higher, and his Spirits lower, which were deadned in him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as when his Wife and Children were about him, and she said to him, <hi>Love, thou saist nothing to me, nor to thy Children;</hi> he only answered, that he had said to her, and to them too. O how good therefore is it for Wives and Children to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and remember what Parents and Husbands say to them in health, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which Counsel may be their last, and that must stand for their Death-bed charge to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>September</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> being the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> though by reason of his Disease he was scarce sensible, yet perceiving it to be the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> he would needs be holpen up, and supported by Pillows, that he might kneel, and be in a praying posture, though he was disabled from the performance of the Duty.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Tuesday, September</hi> the <hi>6th, Anno Christi,</hi> 1664: This Holy Man breathed his <note place="margin">His Death.</note> last, being the <hi>17th</hi> day of his Sickness, and in the Fortieth Year of his Age; and was buried <hi>September</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> with a particular <hi>Eulogy</hi> by the Preacher, and with the deep grief of all the Congregation. Scarce any that began no sooner, and lived no longer, hath done so much good in the World, as he did, in his Capacity.</p>
               <p>A Pious Divine, who at this time is a <hi>Dignitary</hi> in the Church, gives this <hi>Character</hi> of him; <hi>I am</hi> (saith he) <hi>so well satisfied, as to his extraordinary Piety in general, which I never yet heard, or believe, that he departed from, that I wish my everlasting Portion may be with him:</hi> And afterwards he adds: <hi>To conclude, I never knew one more publick spirited, more sensible of Mens spiritual necessities, and more ready (to his abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) to supply them: More zealous for God's Glory, more delighted, incessant, importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and succesful in Prayer, and more thankfully sensible of the Returns thereof, then this Holy Person was; of whom this degenerate World was not worthy, and therefore, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been abundant in the work of the Lord, God hath satisfied him with never ending Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, that his Labour (from which he now rests) may not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>SAmuel Winter</hi> was Born <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1603 at <hi>Balsal,</hi> in the Woodland part <note place="margin">His Birth, Parentage and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> about Seaven Miles from <hi>Coventry,</hi> of Religious Parents; His Father was a Yeo man of good account. When our <hi>Samuel</hi> was about twelve Years old, it pleased God, by the Ministry ofone Mr. <hi>Slader,</hi> then Preacher at the Chappel of <hi>Knowl,</hi> in <hi>Balsal</hi> Parish (if I mistake not) who, in a special manner was brought thither by <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Fathers Interest, and industry, to a waken his Conscience, <note place="margin">His Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> and to make him serious about the things which concerned his everlasting Salvation; As also to stir up in him earnest desires of doing good to the Souls of others; for which end one Day as he came from School, about a Mile from his Fathers house he retired himself under a Hedge to pray; and among other Petitions, he begged of God <note place="margin">His Prayer.</note> that he would qualifie and fit him for the work of the Ministry and make his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours effectual, and succesful therein: At which time he (at least thought that he) heard a voice saying to him; <hi>God hath heard thy Prayer, and designed thee for that work, and thou shalt be an Instrument of converting many Souls to God:</hi> This exceedingly chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> up his Heart, insomuch as, coming home, he applied himself to his Father, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requesting that he might be trained up for the Ministry. His Father asked him the reason of those desires? He told him, what a Prayer he had made to God, and what return he had from God to it.</p>
               <p>His Father, being much affected herewith; soon after sent him to the Free-School <note place="margin">Is sent to School and University.</note> in <hi>Coventry,</hi> where, through his extraordinary diligence and industry, he made so good a progress in <hi>Grammer-</hi>learning, that, though at near Fourteen Years of Age, he understood nothing, or very little of the first Rudiments of <hi>Grammer,</hi> yet within a few Years he became fit for the University; and accordingly he was sent to <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and placed in <hi>Queens-Colledg,</hi> and had, for somtime, that famous Dr. <hi>Preston</hi> for his Tutor. At the Feet of that Learned <hi>Gamiliel,</hi> those Natural, and Gracious abilities <note place="margin">His prosici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</note> which he brought along with him, were much improved; and partly by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and help of so excellent a <hi>Guid,</hi> and partly by God's Blessing upon his unwearied studies, he attained to a great measure of Knowledge, both in the <hi>Tongues and Arts,</hi> and also in <hi>Divinity.</hi>

               <p>When he had Commenced Master of <hi>Arts,</hi> being as yet unwilling to enter upon that great and dreadful work of the Ministry, he left <hi>Cambridg</hi> and went to <hi>Boston</hi> in <note place="margin">Goes to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston.</hi>

                  <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> where he lived under the Ministry of Holy and Learned Mr. <hi>Jobn Cotton,</hi> out of whose Family (somtime after) he married a Wife, one Mrs. <hi>Ann Beeston,</hi> a Gentlewoman of a good Extraction, and one that had a considerable Portion, that Match being of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s contrivance.</p>
               <p>After his Marriage, and his continuance with his Wife, in Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Family, he fell into a dangerous, and violent Feavor, which, in the judgment of his <hi>Physicians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His first Wife. His Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> was desperate, and left no hopes of his Recovery. His Wife being much affected and afflicted herewith, he would often comfort her, telling her that he should not Die at this time; for that God had not yet fulfilled his Promise made to him in his Youth, wherein he had assured him that he should be an instrument of converting many Souls unto him. And accordingly he recovered, and then resolved to apply himself to the work of the Ministry.</p>
               <p>And being more ambitious to do God and his Church-service, then to advance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">His rocove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

This place he always highly esteemed, and would often call it, <hi>His first Born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Woodborow</hi> he was removed to the City of <hi>York,</hi> in which great and populous City he continued a Lecturer for some time, and as there he had great opportunities <note place="margin">His remove to <hi>York.</hi>

There he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Active, and Industrious for God.</p>
               <p>He thought no pains too great whereby the Peoples Souls might be edified. He <note place="margin">His Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> preached twice every <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>day</hi> to them in publick: He expounded the Chapters which he read, and Catechised the younger Persons: In the Evening he repeated the Sermons in his own Family, to which many of the Neighbours also resorted. On the Week days he took occasion to go from House to House, instructing the Ignorant, and endeavouring to build up his Parishoners in their most Holy Faith; and God was pleased so to bless his Labours, that he became instrumental of begetting many Sons and Daughters unto God, as also of confirming many, who attained (partly by his publick Ministry, and partly by his private pains) a great measure of Grace and Gifts, so that they made Conscience of the strict Observation of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>day,</hi> of Closet and Family Duties, and of other Spiritual Services required by God as fruits of <note place="margin">His great success.</note> their Faith.</p>
               <p>He was so meek and affable in his deportment towards all Men, that his Company was pleasing and delightful, even to many of those that had no relish of his Doctrine. <note place="margin">His Affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> At <hi>Cottingham</hi> he buried his loving and dearly beloved Wife, who left him five Sons: which loss yet was (through God's merciful Providence) abundantly repaired in his second Marriage about three Years after) with Mrs <hi>Elizabeth Weaver,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">His second Marriage.</note> of <hi>Christepher Weaver,</hi> Esq; with whom he had a good Portion, and she proved to be excellently quallified, for the good and comfort both of him and his Children: And God was pleased so to bless her Prudent managment of his outward affairs, that when he died he left a plentiful Estate to his Children, besides all those Acts of more than ordinary Bounty, which, both in his Life, and at the time of his Death he testified his Faith by.</p>

Which order of theirs, being sent to him to <hi>Cottingham</hi> where he then lived, he looked upon it as a clear Call from God. Yet for his better satisfaction, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised also with his Friends, and begged direction from God in a business of so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concernment; after which he chearfully embraced this Call, hoping that God would bring some Glory to his own Name, by the Labours of him his unworthy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, in that Kingdom. And so, <hi>not consulting with Flesh and Blood,</hi> which might have suggested to him that it would be an unadvised Act, and disadvantagious to him to part with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And so, Resigning up his Living, he prepared for his Jorney.</p>
               <p>At his coming over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Commissioners allowed him but One hundred Pounds for the first Year, which yet he chearfully accepted of though it did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the charges of his Transportation, with such necessaries as he provided for the <note place="margin">He goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland.</hi>

A great part of his worldly delight consisting in keeping good Horses.</p>
               <p>In this his first Year he attended the Commissioners in several Journies, which they made into the Four Provinces of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was their Houshold Chaplain, performed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, <note place="margin">His frequent Preaching.</note> Duties, and Preached in publick every <hi>Lord's day</hi> wherever they came: And in the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> (where they resided the greatest part of their time) he preached somtimes twice every <hi>Lords-day</hi> in <hi>Christ church</hi> before the Commissioners, the Lord Maior, &amp; Aldermen of that City; many Gentlemen &amp; others resorting to his Ministry.</p>
               <p>Not long after, some other Ministers coming from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners (for the ease of Mr. <hi>Winter)</hi> used to request one or other of them to preach in the Morning, reserving Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> for the Afternoon, at which time was the greatest <hi>Auditory.</hi> But he, being willing to be out of imployment, set up a Lecture, where he preached every <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day in the Morning at Seaven a Clock, <note place="margin">He sets up a Lecture.</note>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:62667:71"/> in the Church of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> within the said City: And this Lecture was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Commissioners, Civil Magistrates, and many others, so that he had a very frequent Congregation; and to encourage poor People to come to Church, he caused some white Loaves to be distributed among them always when the Sermon was ended at his own cost.</p>
               <p>About this time the Commissioners taking notice that <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> by <hi>Dublin,</hi> through the iniquity of the Times, and the distractions of that Kingdom, was left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate by the Fellows and Students, and thereby brought almost to ruine, they thought it their Duty, for the advancement of Religion and Learning, to endeavour the restauration of the same: And for that end they appointed the said Mr. <hi>Winter,</hi> to be the <hi>Provost,</hi> or Master of it; where also, after a time, he commenced <hi>Doctor of Divinity,</hi> having with singular Applause and Approbation, performed all Acts and <note place="margin">He is made Provost of the Colledg.</note> Exercises belonging thereunto. He also out of his care and zeal to promote so pious and profitable a work, in a short time he encouraged, and procured the return of divers of the Fellows and Students to the Colledge, as also the coming over from <hi>England</hi>

               <p>And by the great pains which he took with them, instructing them, both in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Divine Learning, Preaching and Expounding the Sacred Scriptures to them, and often Praying with them both in the Colledge Chappel, and somtimes in his own Lodgings, he gave as great Hopes of the flourishing of that <hi>Seminary</hi> of Learning and Piety, as in any Colledge in <hi>Christendom.</hi> And there they to retaliate his care and pains, gave him an Honourable Testimonial under the Colledge Seal, which is here inserted.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thus we have a brief Narrative of the most remarkable passages of this Holy Mans Life; we are now come to the last <hi>Scene,</hi> wherein we shall find that saying verified and made good, <hi>Vita qualis, Finis talis:</hi> His Humble, and Holy Life being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Comfortable and Glorious Death. His Sun did not set under a Cloud, but shone out with a more bright and greater lustre then is ordinarily seen. It was his main Design and Business to glorifie God in his Life, and God did highly honour him at his Death, as will appear by that which follows.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was in <hi>Rutlandshire,</hi> on <hi>Thursday, October</hi> the <hi>13th, Anno Christi</hi> 1666. he rode to a Neighbouring Town to assist in carrying on a day of Humiliation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <note place="margin">His sickness.</note> having wearied his Body and spent his Spirits, he was fain to defer his return home till the next day. On the <hi>Lord's day</hi> following, he exercised twice for the Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Family wherein he abode; and at his going to be Bed, he found himself not well. On <hi>Munday</hi> he continued ill, yet arose, came down and performed Family Duties.</p>
               <p>At Dinner he could eat but little, and at Night went ill to Bed, yet slept pretty well, only both those Nights he complained of a pain in his right side, and he had frequent provocation to Vomit, but without effect. Oft he found himself a cold; yet when he came a little to the Fire, he was too hot in his own sence, insomuch as his Friends about him judged that it would turn to an Ague.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wednesday</hi> and <hi>Thursday</hi> his Distemper continued, and on <hi>Friday</hi> finding himself still to grow weaker and weaker, he desired his <hi>Will</hi> might be fairly engrossed, which lay by him written with his own Hand, and withal, he laboured to perswade his Wife to be content and willing to part with him: Adding, That it would not be long e're they should meet again: and then he put up earnest Prayers unto God for her, and for other of his Relations.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Friday</hi> he sat up all the Day, but still continued under his Bodily Distempers, and finding his strength to decay, he would often repeat that of the <hi>Psalmist, The Zeal of thy House hath eaten me up. On Saturday</hi> he Sealed and published his <hi>Will,</hi> complaing all that Day of the Cramp in his left Leg. In the Evening he went to Bed, and in the apprehension of those about him, slept well that Night.</p>
               <p>About six a Clock on the <hi>Lord's day</hi> Morning, he raised himself up in his Bed, and with a chearful and loud voice called to his Wife, who lay in a Bed by him, saying, <note place="margin">A Vision of Glory.</note>
                  <hi>Sweet Heart, I have been this Night conversing with Spirits.</hi> And, as in a Rapture, he cryed out, <hi>O the Glories that are prepared for the Saints of God! The Lord hath been pleased to shew me this Night, the exceeding weight of Glory which in Heaven is laid up for his Chosen ones.</hi> Saying further, <hi>That he had studied, and thought that he knew as much what the Glory which in Heaven was, as another Man: But he now saw, that all the Divines on Earth were but Children in the Knowledge of the great Mystery of heavenly Glory, which the Lord that Night had given him a clearer sight of, then ever formerly he had. That it was such a Mystery as could not be comprehended by the Wit of Man, with many other</hi> such like Expressions; and he had his Soul so wonderfully elevated, that he could not declare what he found and felt therein.</p>
               <p>Then he desired that his Relations, and the rest of the Family might be called up, that so he might make known unto them that immense weight of Glory which that Night had been revealed to him. When they were Assembled he did with vehemency and intension of Spirit, endeavour to discover the same unto them in the expressions aforesaid: But he was so swallowed up in the Contemplation thereof that he could not utter what he desired.</p>
               <p>And so he continued all that day, and even till he died in very high Raptures, and great acclamations by way of Thankfulness unto God for the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the <note place="margin">Raptures.</note>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:62667:72"/> Fountain of that Glorie, and for those evident Discoveries of the same unto him.</p>
               <p>Towards the Evening of the <hi>Lord's day,</hi> an honourable Person, together with his Lady, and some other Friends came to visit him, with whom he discoursed about Heaven and the things of God as understandingly, servently and fluently as if he had enjoyed his best Health: His understanding and Memory continuing as strong and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous as ever: In his Discourse he quoted sundry Texts of Scripture, citing the very Chapter, Verse, and Words, and explaining the meaning from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Originals. After this Discourse, which continued about the space of two hours, finding himself weary, he betook himself to Bed, all the Company withdrawing into another Chamber. And after an Hours repose, he desired that the said Honourable Person, with his Lady, and other Friends might be called in again, that he might speak somthing more unto them, and when they, with the rest of the Family were come into his Chamber, he told them that he thought he had but a short time to live. That he was going unto <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> with him to partake of the <hi>fulness of Joy,</hi> and of those <hi>Rivers of Pleasure,</hi> which God had so lately discovered unto him, and which he had reserved in Heaven for those that love him and keep his Commandments. O (said he) <hi>if you had but a thorough sight thereof, it would make you all to love the</hi> Lord Jesus Christ <hi>and Holiness, which is the only way prescribed by God to attain to this Happiness.</hi> And so he went on to magnifie the Riches of free Grace, through which alone the Saints do come to enjoy that <hi>exceeding, exceeding eternal weight of Glory, which neither Eye hath seen, nor Ear heard, nor can enter into the Heart of Man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He also exhorted them, not so much to trouble themselves in getting assurance of <note place="margin">Good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</note> Salvation, as to examine themselves carefully, diligently whether they were in the way of Sanctification: And for this end, he commended two things to their serious Meditations, about which he advised them dayly to ask their Souls these two Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>What am I? And where am I? What am I?</hi> Am I a New-Creature? Am I born again? If so, then I have New Thoughts; New Words; New Company; and a New Conversation: All old Thoughts, Words, and Actions will be done away. Secondly, <hi>Where am I?</hi> Am I in the narrow Path that leads to Life Eternally, or in that Broad Way that leads to Death and Damnation? He told them, that if any there present were still in the Broad Way, it had been better that they had never been Born. And (said he) <hi>If you will make this your continual Meditation, you cannot miscarry. And if you find your selves to be in the Narrow Way of Sanctification, let God alone with the Rest, to give you an Assurance of your future happiness, which he will certainly do in his own time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He further declared to them, that as by all his Preaching, through all the course of his Ministry, he had discovered and published this way of Holiness through <hi>Christ</hi> to be the only way to Heaven, so could he now at his Death set out no other way: And that if he were again to begin his Ministry, he could hold out no other way to attain unto Glory. And so with much weariness of Spirit, looking up towards Heaven, he begged of God that the words of a Dying Man might make a deep impression upon the Hearts of his Hearers; and that as God had made him an Instrument of converting many Souls unto him in his Life, so he would bless what he had now spoken, that some one Soul might be brought to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> by this his last Sermon.</p>
               <p>Then▪ he further proceeded to other Holy Discourses and Instructions, quoting sundry Texts of Scripture for the proof of what he spake naming the Chapters, Verses, and Words of the Texts, which he opened, and explained out of the <hi>Originals,</hi> with that accurness and strength of Words, with that Zeal and Fervency of Spirit as was admirable, so that he drew Tears from the Eyes of all that were present, whether Younger or Elder. And lest any there present should think that his Understanding and Memory were grown weak, or that he was overcome through the abundance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations which he had the Night before, to let them know that he had spoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the words of Truth and Soberness, and that with a perfect understanding of what he spake, he made to them this Narrative following.</p>
               <p>He told them the manner of his Education in Religion from his Childhood, and of the Vanity which did attend his youthful Dayes; and where and how God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto him for his Conversion at Twelve Years of Age, and of the assurance which God had given him (as is before related) that he should be an instrument of Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Souls to God: as also of his proficiency in Learning from that very time.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:62667:73"/>
               <p> He further declared (with Tears trickling down his Cheeks) that he had many and many a time in private, before he went to Preach, put God in mind of his Promise so made unto him, and earnestly besought him to make good that Promise, by giving a Blessing to that good Word of his, which he was then going to deliver, that some Glory might redound to his Holy Name thereby: To which his Prayers God had often been pleased to give a gracious Answer, and to let him know it by the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some by those very Sermons.</p>
               <p>One of his Relations then present, fearing that his Spirits would be weakened and spent by that his continued Discourse, requested him to repose himself for a while; to whom he replied with much earnestness and strength of Voice: No, were I sure that this should be my last Night (as indeed it proved) and the last Sermon that I should Preach, I would continue it two Hours longer: Adding, that he was not afraid of Death: And turning his Head backward, he said, <hi>Death is a Coward; he comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me: he dares not look me in the Face.</hi> And he further said, <hi>The Devil hath oft assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in my Life time; but God stood by me and gave me strength to resist him, so that he could never hurt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Day following he lay in heavenly Contemplations and Raptures, often break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth in Praises unto God for <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and would somtimes desire his Wife, and other Friends to tell him whether he were in the Body or out of the Body, for he could not tell. And a Minister being then in the House, he desired that he might be called in, and when he was come, he propounded the same Question unto him, who answered, That he was in Life, and among his Friends on Earth, and therefore in the Body: To this he replied, <hi>It is true,</hi> and therewith rested satisfied, and desired the Minister to pray with him; which he did accordingly.</p>
               <p>His Wife told him that some Friends there present hoped that he might yet recover and live: To which he answered, <hi>Can a dead Man live? Will God work Miracles?</hi> And shortly after he said, <hi>God is doing great things in the World:</hi> And he much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the sad estate and condition of the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Afternoon finding Death to approach, he often cryed out, <hi>O the Power of Death!</hi> not that he feared it: For it shrunk from him: but he found such a Power in Death as none could know but those that were under it. He also wished that his Sons had been present that they might see what the Power of Death was, and what it was to die. He desired also that some Neighbours in the Town might be called in, that he might Preach his last Sermon to them: And indeed, to this very present time his Spirits, Speech, and Memory continued very active and strong.</p>
               <p>About four a Clock in the Afternoon his Wife, and his Wives Brother and Sister, <note place="margin">His Death.</note> standing by his Bedside, asked him how he did? He answered, very weak: adding, That he was going to <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and bad them not to be <hi>afraid of Death:</hi> with which words he put forth his Hand, and said, <hi>Brother, Sister, take Death by the Hand: be not afraid; Death is a Coward; he flyes from me:</hi> They found that his Hands were cold and clamy, whereby they perceived that he grew near to his end: and himself not long after, feeling that the dissolution of his Earthly Tabernacle, was now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching; lifting up his Eyes towards Heaven, he cryed out, <hi>Come Lord</hi> Jesus: And presently, with a smiling Countenance, he added, <hi>Art thou come?</hi> And so he breathed out his last, and fell a sleep.</p>
               <p>Thus Reader, thou hast had a prospect of the more considerable Passages of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Mans Life and Death. Pause hear a while, and take a second view of all again, and then surely thou canst not but wish (though it is desired for thee, that it may be from a better Principle then was in <hi>Baalam) Let me die the Death</hi> of this blessed Man, <hi>and let my last end be like his.</hi> But in vain shalt thou wish for this, if the Pattern of his Holy and Exemplary Life be neglected by thee.</p>
               <p>We read of a Person of a loose Life, that hearing what a comfortable end St. <hi>Bernard</hi> made, said to his Companions; <hi>I would willingly die like St.</hi> Bernard, <hi>but I would live with and like you:</hi> 'Tis too certain that very many are of the same mind: But as it is impossible, but that an Holy Life should have a blessed and happy Death <hi>(Mark the perfect Man, and behold the Ʋpright: For the End of that Man is Peace,</hi> Psal. 37. 37.) So it is as impossible (in an ordinary way) that a loose and wicked Life, should have other than a miserable and uncomfortable Death, though some delusive, fading flashes of seeming Peace and comfort they may somtimes have which are but as a Blaze of Thorns which is suddenly extinct: For God himself hath said it, <hi>There is no Peace to the wicked</hi> (Isa. 48. 22.) And again: <hi>The wicked are driven away in their</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:62667:73"/>
                  <hi>wickedness: but the Righteous hath hope in his Death. Impius dum spirat Sperat: Sed Justus cum expirat sperat.</hi> The wicked while they live, hope, but with a vain, and ungrounded hope: But the Righteous hope when they die, with a lively, and well grounded hope that never leaves them till it brings them to the fruition of the thing hoped for.</p>
               <p>There yet remains somthings to be spoken which could not well be reduced to any one part of the Narrative of this worthy Persons life, because they did (like so many Golden Threads) pass through the whole Web: Or like the Spirits in the Blood, which run through the whole Body; and therefore these were thought fit to be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the close of all, that the Reader may have a view of them altogether. And they are such Gifts and Graces as were very remarkable in this Man of God: For so I call him, not only because he was a Minister, and so God's Servant in a more peculiar sence; but also because of those eminent and excellent Virtues appearing in him, by which God did set his Mark or Seal upon him, as his peculiar Treasure. And these Graces were so conspicuous in him, that all that knew and were acquainted with him, will readily attest to the Truth of them: And they may be thus ranked in Order.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His great Humility and Meekness of Spirit.</item>
                  <item>2. His Diligence and Industry in his Calling.</item>
                  <item>3. His Zeal and Fervour, manifesting it self in his Praying, Preaching, Conference, and strict Observation of the <hi>Lord's Day.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. His Liberality and Bounty upon all good occasions.</item>
                  <item>5. His great Candor, and Ingenuity.</item>
                  <item>6. His Faith and Patience.</item>
                  <item>7. His Power and Prevalency in Prayer.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, <hi>To</hi> begin with his Humility: as that excellent Grace which embellished and <note place="margin">His Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> gave a lustre to all the rest, and is often enjoyned and pressed in the sacred Scriptures, and was most admirable in the Life of our blessed Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who proposes himself as a Pattern to us in that Grace especially. And surely all that knew this worthy Doctor, will readily acknowledge this to have been very eminent in him; and that, not only in his Words and Garb, and some trivial Actions, which may easily be personated and counterfeited (as they were in that Frier, who always went seemingly dejected, and looking downwards towards the Earth, until he was chosen and made the <hi>Abbot</hi> of the <hi>Monastry,</hi> and then he altered his Mode, and gave this Reason of it; <hi>That he had long been looking for the Keys of the</hi> Abby, <hi>and that now, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found them, he needed no longer to according to his former custom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in our Doctor, Humility was of an higher strain, of a more Noble Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and deeplier radicated in his Heart. And truly it was the more admirable and Exemplary in him, having divers singular endowments which might have elevated and puffed up his Heart with Pride; as, a plentiful Estate; was of a considerable Rank in the World, and of great Abilities: But these were poor things in his esteem. He could condescend to Men of the lowest Rank. He used to magnifie the abillities of ohers whilst he thought and speak meanly of his own, and was not offended if others did the like. He could easily bear the Contradictions of others, and stoop to the meanest Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices if thereby he might do good to Souls. It's well known that he would go to the poorest Neighbours Houses in his Parish, and there sit and discourse with them about the great and weighty concernments of their Souls; Qustioning with, and instructing them in the Principles of Religion; and at his Departure would give them some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that by his Deeds he might add the more weight to his Words, and make his <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> next Return the more Welcome. And this he did, not to gain Proselytes to himself, or a Name among Men, but to win them to <hi>Christ,</hi> and to be a means in furthering the Eternal Salvation of their Souls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His Diligence and Sedulity in his Calling was very Great and Exemplary. A hard Student he was all a long, and so he continued to the last. 'Tis scare credible, <note place="margin">Industry.</note> but to those that saw and knew it, what a great number of Books were found in his Library, filled with Transcriptions out of the Authors which he read over; Besides, pieces of Controversies, and Observations of his own. And indeed, there were few Books that he Read, but he took Notes out of them, and made Marks in them of what was most considerable. To which if we shall add all his Manuscripts (which had been the Summ of near Twenty Years Study) lost in the time of the late Wars, we cannot but conclude him to have been a most Faithful, and painful Labourer in the Lord's Vineyard. His daily Practice declared him to be a Person very careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem time, and as fearful to lose, or mispend and waste it.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:62667:74"/>
               <p> As soon as he was up in the Morning, whilst he dressed himself, either his Wife or <note place="margin">Time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note> a Servant read to him some Chapters in course, out of the <hi>Old and New Testament.</hi> When he was drest, he retired himself into his Study, where he ordinarily continued till he was called down to Prayer and Dinner: After which, for better digestion, he intermitted his Studies, and took opportunities of Discourse with Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that came to visit him, who knew that to be the only time wherein they might find him at leasure: For he used to forbid them coming to him in the Forenoon, that so his Studies might not be interrupted. And then after two or three Hours inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, he returned into his Study again, where, for the most part, both in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Winter he continued till about Eight a Clock at Night, seldom eating any Supper, or very sparingly.</p>
               <p>When in the Evening he was come down, calling his Family together, he read a Chapter in course, gave the Sense of it, went to Prayer, and so to Bed, often grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time that he spent in sleep, and eating. Here also may be added, that as it was his ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to be well prepared before he went to Preach (for he would not offer either to God or Man that which cost him nothing) so did he strive to get his Heart into a right frame for Preaching, that from the Heart he might speak to the Hearts of his Hearers, as he used often to say: And to obtain assistance from God therein, he used by private Prayer to beg God's Blessing upon his Labours. It was his frequent saying, That he was as circumspect and diligent in studying what he was to deliver, as if he expected no assistance from <hi>Christ,</hi> yet when he came to Preach, disowning his own endeavours, he wholly cast himself upon <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> for strength and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as if he had not studied at all. And that God many times suggested such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his mind in the delivery of his Sermons, as he had not thought on before, which also he observed, God did abundantly bless to the com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rt and edification of his Auditory.</p>
               <p>He would often say, <hi>That his Opportunities were his Riches,</hi> and he was alwayes careful to improve them; whence it seldom came to pass that he Preached without making some real impression upon his Hearers, which was discovered by the Tears that fell from many of their Eyes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Zeal and Fervour deserves our serious consideration. It was the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel <note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> of a Grave and Holy Divine, <hi>That Christians should take heed that their Old Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did not abate their Youthful Affections:</hi> And certainly there was in this our Old Doctor, such warmth of Affections as is seldom seen in so ancient a Man, and yet it was mannaged with such Christian Prudence, that he exercised it, not about light and trivial matters, but about the greater and more substantial Points of Religion, and that through the whole course of his Life. Whether he Preached, Prayed, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed about Holy and Divine things, all was performed, and accompanied with much Zeal and warmth of Affections: He was <hi>Fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12. 11. O how glad was he of an Opportunity of Preaching, and if (after the black day) his Liberty could have been purchased by Money, what would he not have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for it?</p>
               <p>He was very affectionate in Prayer, and yet were his Affections so moderated and tempered with Prudence and Judgment, that though upon extraordinary Occasions, he could enlarge and exspatiate himself therein, yet in his Family Prayers he was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally short, that so he might not make Religious duties a burthen to those that join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him. And as his Prayers were fervent and mixed with Faith, so he had this Honour from God that he had many signal Returns and Answers to his Prayers, as shall be shewed afterwards, as can be attested by many yet living, who had benefit by them, or were Eye or Ear witnesses of them, and that both for Soul and Bodily Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers and Afflictions.</p>
               <p>He was Conscientiously strict and careful in the observation and Sanctification of the <note place="margin">Sabbaths Sanctified.</note>
                  <hi>Lord's days;</hi> not permiting any Discourses in his presence, but such as were suitable to the Day, and to the Duties thereof: And he would Rebuke and Reproove such as took liberty to Discourse about their Worldly businesses upon God's <hi>holy Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, His <hi>Liberality and Bounty</hi> were as Eminent and Exemplary as any other <note place="margin">His great Liberality.</note> of his Virtues and Graces. As God gave him a large and plentiful Estate, so he gave him a free and large Heart, which was a double Mercy. He was <hi>Rich in Good Works, ready to Distribute willing to Communicate: Laying up in store for himself a good Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the time to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 18, 19. He was often heard to say, <hi>That he could fare hardly and go meanly, that he might be the better enabled thereby to relieve the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ssities</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62667:74"/>
                  <hi>of them that were in want:</hi> And it is believed that few of his Estate and Rank <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xceeded him herein. Seldom did any necessitous Persons come to him; seldom did he hear of the wants of others, though at a distance from him, but they tasted of his Bounty.</p>
               <p>He gave large Summs of Money every Year for divers Years together, to Pious and Charitable uses, as his Wife can testifie, who kept an account in Writing of the several Summs so disbursed by him. Towards the relief of the Poor persecuted <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> in <hi>Piemont</hi> he gave Thirty Pounds; and as much the same Year to another Charitable use. He gave also several considerable Summs yearly for the maintenance and encouragement of some poor Schollars in the Colledge by <hi>Dublin,</hi> besides a large Summ of Money disbursed out of his own Purse, towards furnishing the Library there with good Books. As as he had thus sundry ways exercised and declared his Bounty whilst he lived, so at his Death he gave large Legacies to Pious and Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uses, and God made good that Promise to him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 10. <hi>If thou draw out thy Soul to the Hungry, and satisfiest the afflicted Soul: Then shall thy Light rise in obscurity, and thy Darkness be as the Noon day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, To this Grace of Charity may be added his Candor, and Courteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment <note place="margin">His Candor and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy.</note> in mannaging of it, which gave a great lustre to his Bounty, according to that of the Poet:</p>
               <q>Dat bene, dat multum, qui dat cum Munere Vultum.</q>
               <p>His <hi>Meekness</hi> was such that he was not apt to be offended with others, much less <note place="margin">His Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> was he apt to offend others. He always interpreted to the best Sence that which might seemingly have ministred occasion of disgust, by which obligingness, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Temper, he drew Love and Respect to himself where ever he came, and with whom soever he conversed; whether in private Families, or in his more publick im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
               <p>Sixthy, His <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> calls for our serious consideration, of both which, <note place="margin">Faith and Patience.</note> as he had given good proof in the whole course of his Life, so they eminently shone forth when he came to die. In the time of his Sickness he shewed an humble, holy, and chearful resignation of himself to the Wise and Merciful disposal of God, his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father. Not one repining word was heard to proceed out of his Mouth: He was <hi>Dumb and opened not his Mouth, because it was the Lord that did it,</hi> Psal. 39. 9. There was not so much as an impatient or uncomly motion seen in him: But being full of <note place="margin">Death not feared.</note> Faith and Christian Patience and Courage, he feared not Death, but was well resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and prepared against the stroke of it: And would often say, <hi>O how happy a thing is it, by Death to be above a possibility of sinning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Heathen <hi>Philosophers</hi> called Death, <hi>The most terrible of all terribles,</hi> and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture calls i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The King of Terrors.</hi> It is storied, that one hearing a Person high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended for his rare and excellent Virtues, said, <hi>Let us stay till his Death, and then we shall be the better able to judg of all these things which make such a glittering shew in him for the present.</hi> And certainly to be able to look the <hi>King of Terrors</hi> in the Face, without an appaled Countenance, and to meet the last Enemy <hi>[Death]</hi> with joy and comfort is no small evidence of a true and strong Faith: And this was evidently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and seen in this worthy Doctor at the time of his Death.</p>
               <p>He often declared in his Health, that in his younger Days, he had been sorely vexed and perplexed with Satana Temptations; but at last, meeting with a plain, honest Christian (such an other probably as was that Shepherd with whom <hi>Junius</hi> met) to whom, complaining of his Fears, he first rebuked him, and then instructed him, <note place="margin">Good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</note> saying, <hi>You look at the Reward without minding and attending your Work, in that you desire and expect assurance, before you have well resolved of doing your Duty. My ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice therefore is, to mind what God requires of you in your present station, and be serious and diligent therein, and assurance will come in God's due time.</hi> This advice, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, was of great use to him all his Life after; so that from that time forward he was not troubled with such perplexing Thoughts as formerly he had been: But he lived and died in Peace both with God and Man in the Great <hi>Climaterical</hi> Year of his Age, <hi>October</hi> the <hi>22th. Anno Christi,</hi> 1666.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And lastly, His <hi>power and prevalency in Prayer</hi> was very remarkable, and more than ordinary.</p>
               <p>The wise <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us <hi>(Prov.</hi> 12. 2.) <hi>That a good Man obtaineth favour of the</hi>

                     </gap>;</hi> as <hi>Mercer</hi> hath it out of <hi>Rabbi Levi.</hi> 'Tis written of <hi>Luther, Iste vir potuit a Deo quicquid voluit:</hi> That by his Prayer he could prevail with God at his pleasure: <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>Myconius,</hi> being sick of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Diseases, were both recovered by <hi>Luther</hi>'s Prayers. <hi>Sozomon,</hi> saith of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi> That he never asked any thing of God in all his Life which he obtained not. <hi>Blessed is he that hath what he will, and Wills nothing but what he should.</hi> The <hi>Persons of Saints</hi> (saith a Reverend Divine) <hi>are like secret Pledges of common quiet, and their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Prayers are a Shield to the Earth against the Wrath of Heaven. Faithful Prayer</hi> (saith another) <hi>is able, after a sort, to alter God's mind, and to transfuse a Dead Palsy into the Hands of Omnipotency,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 10. where God is fain to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak his own freedom, <hi>Let me alone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We have many Examples in Scripture of the Power and Efficacy of Prayer. <hi>Jacob</hi> would have a Blessing, and therefore by Prayers wrestles with might and slight; <note place="margin">Prayer Powerful.</note> and this he doth in the Night, when alone, and God about leaving him, and upon one Leg. He had a hard pull and yet prevailed. The Woman of <hi>Canaan (Mat.</hi> 15. 23.) came for a cure, and a cure she would have, and she had it at last, with an high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of her <hi>Horoical Faith</hi> in Prayer. God heaps Mercies upon his Suppliants, (as <hi>Naaman</hi> did upon <hi>Gehazi)</hi> and blames them for their Modesty in asking: <hi>Hitherto</hi> (said he) <hi>ye have asked nothing,</hi> that is, nothing to what you might and should. <hi>Ask and have, that your Joy may be full, Joh.</hi> 16. 24. Many other Scripture Examples might be produced, but lest any should think that those were extraordinary, and that the like are not to be found in our Days, take notice of these Instances follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Winter,</hi> in his younger Days was cast out of his Living, his first Wife, <note place="margin">The first Instance.</note> having many Children, fell into great Grief, and perplexity of Mind, fearing lest she and hers should come to want. Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> was much troubled to see his Wif's discontents, and thereupon plied the Throne of Grace for cure thereof; and one Day, as he was riding abroad, and crying earnestly unto God about this matter, he thought that he heard a Voice, saying unto him, <hi>Because thou hast not spared thine Estate for my Glory, neither thou, nor any of thine shall want.</hi> At his return home he told this to his Wife with Joy, saying, <hi>That he would not for all he was worth, want that comfortable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When an Order was sent to Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> from the Parliament that then was, to attend <note place="margin">A second Instance.</note> their Commissioners into <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Wife was very unwilling thereunto, and some of their near Relations came on purpose to diswade him from going; himself also was very fearful of the Seas. In this his great strait, he retired into his Study (as his usual manner was in like cases) and there with much earnestness, he spread the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God craving his Guidance, and direction therein. And the Lord was pleased to set it upon his Spirit, that he should go, and be carried in safety thither, and there become an Instrument of converting many Souls to God. When he had declared this to his Wife, and Friends, they acquiesced, and so he resolved upon that Journey: And according to this Gracious Promise of God, though they took Shipping in the midst of Winter, and went with a <hi>Master</hi> that was not very well acquainted with those <hi>Seas,</hi> yet they found the Seas calm, and their Passage so speedy, that whereas some other great Persons went out before them, and with a more experienced <hi>Master,</hi> yet they arrived in safety about four and twenty Hours before them, insomuch as the Captain of the Ship said, <hi>That in his whole Life he had never known so calm and speedy a Passage before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after Mr. <hi>Winter</hi>'s coming into <hi>Ireland</hi> he went with the Commissioners <note place="margin">A third Instance.</note> unto <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> in which place Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> his VVife fell very sick of the <hi>Yellow Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi> and some other Distempers; for which cause her Husband invited certain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and some other Friends to spend some Hours in Prayer unto God in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. And Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> was the last Man that prayed. But before he began, he went to her and asked her, <hi>Whether she had Faith to be healed?</hi> She answered, She thought she had. Then he went to Prayer, and wrestled exceedingly with God for her reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: And when he had done, he went again unto her, and advised her to be very careful and diligent in the use of all good means for the recovery of her Health; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, That she should live, and not die at that time: at this saying of his, his Wife and Sister were much troubled, and told him in private, that they would have given much Money, rather then that he should have spoken so confidently of her recovery,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62667:75"/> there being so many <hi>Anabaptists</hi> present at that time: And they feared that if his Words proved true, they might thereby be confirmed in their <hi>Enthusiastical</hi> conceits; if otherwise, that then they might take occasion to scandalize his Person and Ministry: But he again told them that she should not die at that time.</p>
               <p>Yet after this she continued very weak for a Month or more: her Doctors gave her up for a dead Woman, whereupon Mr. <hi>Winters</hi> Wife again blamed him, for his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent saying, <hi>That she must live;</hi> to which he smillingly answered, <hi>Well, she is not yet Dead,</hi> At length her Disease so prevailed, that she lost the use of her Senses, and her Servants that stood weeping about her, said, <hi>Now she is near death indeed.</hi> The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> following, as Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> sat at Dinner, a Messenger came to him from Collonel <hi>Jones,</hi> to tell him, That if he would see his Wife alive, he must come away presently, for that she was now a dying. At this Mrs. <hi>Winter</hi> was much troubled, because of her Husbands former confidence in Promising her Life: But Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> made no great hast to be gone, saying, <hi>That he knew well when God answered his Prayers, and when not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had dined he went to the House, where he found the Collonel sitting by her, ready to close her Eyes so soon as Breath departed out of her Body, for so she had enjoyned him in the time of her Health. She lay speechless and without the use of her Senses, not answering, nor moving her Eyes, though her Husband, and Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> called unto her, whereupon her Husband judged that she had lost her Hearing. Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> requested that he might pray with her; but her Husband refused, saying, <hi>That she was Sensless, and had been a dying all that Morning.</hi> Mr. <hi>VVinter</hi> urged again that yet he might pray with her: <hi>No</hi> (said the Collonel) <hi>it is to no purpose: She is now a dead VVoman.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>VVinter</hi> urged the third time, that he might pray, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Her Life is yet in her; and whilst there is life, there is hope,</hi> and so he went to Prayer, which he performed with much earnestness and importunity, joyned with many Tears.</p>
               <p>When Prayer was ended, Mr. <hi>VVinter,</hi> going to her Bed-side, she looked upon him, and with a smiling Countenance, said, <hi>O, see the fruit of Prayer! O, see the fruit of Paryer! Set me up, and give me something to eat: I am cured, but not by the Art of Doctors: only Free grace, and fervent Prayers have prevailed with God for me.</hi> They asked her, What she could eat? She answered, any thing. They gave her some Bread and Butter, of which she did eat pritty heartily. Then did her Husband send for her Doctors; but she had them not to provide any more <hi>Physick</hi> for her, saying, That she would take none; for she would not dishonour God: nor wrong prayer so much (by which she was now cured) as to take any more <hi>Physick:</hi> Nor could she, by any means be perswaded to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On Munday</hi> following in the Afternoon, Mrs. <hi>VVinter</hi> heard that Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> was walking in her Garden, which she wondring at, went to see her, and found her there indeed. So soon as she saw Mrs. <hi>VVinter,</hi> she went to meet her, and said, <hi>O, see the fruit of Prayer!</hi> Mrs. <hi>VVinter,</hi> blessed God for her recovery; whereupon she said, <hi>My Doctors would have me take some more Physick of them: but it is God that hath cured me, and he only shall have the praise of it. I will take nothing of them: they shall not boast that they have cured me: For God by Prayer hath done it. It's Prayer alone that hath done it.</hi> And indeed hearin God made good that gracious Promise of his, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>The Prayer of Faith shall save the Sick, and the Lord shall raise him up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Months after, Mr. <hi>VVinter</hi> with his Family, removed to <hi>Dublin;</hi> and after sometime the aforesaid Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> fell sick again, and her Sickness prevailed so far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, that, growing very weak, she was confined to her Bed; whereupon on a <hi>Lord's day,</hi> Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> and his Wife, and her Sister went to visit her: when they came, <note place="margin">A fourth Instance.</note> they found an other Minister with her; but she called for Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> to pray with her. A Lady that was present, coming to Mrs. <hi>VVinter</hi>'s Sister, said, <hi>O! do you think this good VVoman will recover, or not?</hi> She answered, I know not yet: but when my Brother <hi>Winter</hi> hath done Prayer, I will tell you more. When Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> had ended his Prayer, she came to her again, an said, <hi>What think you now?</hi> She answered, She believed that she would not recover, and so said Mrs. <hi>Winter</hi> also. The reason whereof was, because they observed that in his Prayer, he was more earnest in Praying for the Spiritual, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare of her Soul, then for her Bodily health.</p>
               <p>When they were returned home, Mrs. <hi>VVinter</hi> asked her Husband, what he thought of her? He answered, <hi>She will die.</hi> And this he said, Because when in prayer he would have begg'd of God to restore her to Health, he could not do it; but could only pray for her Eternal happiness. <hi>Faithful Prayer is ordained of God to be a means to obtain what we want and desire, and therefore 'tis never put up in vain, but shall have an</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:62667:76"/>
                  <hi>answer,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14, 15. For where God gives a Tongue to speak, he hath an Ear to hear. 'Tis the Observation of a Reverend Divine of our own: <hi>That when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to hear, he lays the Key of Prayer out of the way; as being loth that such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Breath as that of Prayer is, should be without it's full and clearest success.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> grew worse and worse, and continued in a languishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for some Months. She had several Doctors, who sed her with hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, Mr <hi>Winter</hi> prayed oft with her, but still after the same manner, insomuch as his Wife told him, that she thought he did not love Mrs <hi>Jones</hi> as formerly, because he prayed not for her Life: he answered, that his Love was the same, but he was so bound up in his Spirit, that he could not pray for her recovery, and therefore he conceived that she would die.</p>
               <p>At length Mrs. <hi>Jones</hi> finding her self very weak, sent for Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> to pray with her, and after Prayer, she said unto him: <hi>Sir, I fear you love me not so much as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. God heard your Prayers for me when I was dying at</hi> Kilkenny, <hi>but now you do not Pray so earnestly for my life as you did then.</hi> No (said he) I neither do, nor can do it, tho I love you as well as ever: For when I would Pray for your Life, my tongue is turned to Pray for your Eternal Welfare. Therefore I believe that you are not a woman for this World, but will shortly be in a better. <hi>Think you so,</hi> said she, hereupon she sent for a Collonels Wife, between whom and her self there was some difference, and they were reconciled together. She sent also for her Husband, and imparted her mind to him: Adding, that she saw that she must die, for that Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> could not Pray for her, as he did in former Sickness: And it pleased God shortly to take her to himself.</p>
               <p>At an other time Mrs <hi>Winters</hi> Sister going for <hi>England,</hi> left her only Son with her; <note place="margin">A fifth Instance.</note> And after a while the Child fell into an high Feavour, and one Morning the maid with whom the Child lay, came to her Mrs and told her, she feared the Child had the Plague, for that he had many Spots in his Bosom; And the Plague, at this time, was in <hi>Dublin.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Winter</hi> presently sent for a Doctor, who, when he had seen the Child, said, that they were either Plague Spots, or Feavour Spots, and that he much feared the Childs life. Hereupon Mrs <hi>Winter</hi> went to her Husband in his Study, and acquainted him with these things, requesting him that he would be earnest with God in begging the Childs Life. At Noon, when her Husband came down, we asked him, what he thought of the Child? He bad her not to perplex and trouble her self, for the Child would live: And before the next day the Child began to amend, and within a few dayes was perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mrs <hi>VVinter</hi> herself was somtime under a strong Temptation to become an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A sixth Instance.</note> being strongly perswaded that it was the way of God: And she proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so far that she had been Dipped, but that she feared it would reflect upon her Husbands credit. Her Husband took much pains with her to reclaim and settle her in the Truth, yet could she not be convinced of her Error, but continued Night and Day in great perplexity of Spirit, only she relyed upon that gracious Promise of <hi>Christ. John</hi> 7. 17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God.</hi> And at last she resolved to set a day apart to seek unto God for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this doubtful Case. But it fell out that, that very day, they were earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invited to dine wirh Doctor <hi>Jones,</hi> and Mr. <hi>VVinter</hi> had promised to go: But his Wife said, she could not go, because she had set that day apart upon such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: Her Husband answered her; <hi>Thou must go, for I have been Praying for thee, and God hath assured me that thou shalt be satisfied, and that quickly too:</hi> And so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it came to pass. For she was so resolved, and satisfied from Heaven, that afterwards she was able to Dispute with the <hi>Female Anabaptists,</hi> yea, and to confute them; Insomuch as some of the Officers who were of that perswasion, would suffer their Wives to come no more unto her.</p>
               <p>Whilest they were in <hi>Dublin</hi> Mrs. <hi>VVinters</hi> Sisters Husband, being upon his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions <note place="margin">A seaventh Instance.</note> in <hi>London,</hi> he fell very dangerously Sick, Sr. <hi>Francis Pridjean,</hi> and an other Doctor were his <hi>Physitians,</hi> who after a time gave him up for Dead. An other of Mrs. <hi>VVinters</hi> Sisters wrot her word of it; Adding, that she believed before that Letter could come to her Hands he would be Dead and Buried. As soon as they received it, his Wife desired that that afternoon might beset apart to seek God, in her Husbands behalf; and accordingly some Ministers and Christians were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to meet together for that end: When the time was come, Mrs. <hi>VVinter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested her Husband to come away, for that the company were met together: He
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62667:76"/> bad her go before; For he must endeavour to know of the Lord whether he was yet living or no: For (said he) <hi>do you think that I will Pray for a Dead Man?</hi> when some of the Ministers had Prayed, Doctor <hi>VVinter</hi> came in. They Pray'd with submission, that if he where yet in the Land of the Living, the Lord would be pleased to be his <hi>Physician,</hi> and to direct and bless all good means to him for the recovery of his Health. But in the close of the day, when Doctor <hi>VVinter</hi> came to Pray, he shewed much confidence, that he was yet alive, to the amazment of all that heard him. But his Sister in Law who knew his manner, and had much experience of the succesfulness of his Prayers, between Hope and Fear could not contain herself from cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, when Doctor <hi>VVinter</hi> had concluded and was risen from his knees, he went to her, and took her by the hand, saying: <hi>Be of good comfort, for your Husband is alive, and shall recover, and you shall see him again with Joy.</hi> She crying out aloud, said, Ah, Brother, I fear he is Dead: Do you think he is alive? <hi>I know</hi> (said he) <hi>that he is alive,</hi> and repeated over his former words again: And accordingly in their next Letters they heard of his recovery.</p>
               <p>At another time Mrs. <hi>VVinters</hi> Sister (who was with them in <hi>Ireland)</hi> fell into a dangerous Relaps after a Feavour, being great with Child, and within two Months <note place="margin">An Eight Istance.</note> of her time; At which time she fell into a great bleeding at the Nose. She had three Doctors and <hi>Chyrurgions,</hi> who used all their Arts, and yet could not stop it. At length she fell into Travel, and two Midwives were sent for to her: She was fain to sit upright in her Bed, and could not ly down because of her violent bleeding. Her Midwives and Doctors gave her up for a dead Woman; And she grew so weak, that her Sister <hi>VVinter</hi> not enduring to see her die, left her, and went to her own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, were she found that her Sisters Husband had caused Doctor <hi>VVinter</hi> to arise (it being in the Night) and to Pray for his Wife, which accordingly he did with much earnestness; And it pleased God, that presently after news was brought them, that she was delivered of a dead Child.</p>
               <p>Hereupon Doctor <hi>VVinter</hi> and his Wife went to see her, and found her still Bleeding; And the Doctors and <hi>Chyrurgians</hi> were sent for again, who agreed to open a vain and let her Blood: The <hi>Chyrurgion</hi> struck her right Arm, but no blood came, the Doctors bid him try the other Arm; He answered, <hi>That it was to no purpose, for she had no Pulse for some hours before;</hi> Yet the Doctors caused him to do it, and then some few drops of Blood came. But most of this time Doctor <hi>VVinter</hi> was Praying for her in the next room, and she somtimes over heard him, but could not speak. Afterwards she told them that these thoughts were in her Head; <hi>Yonder Good Man would fain have me live, but it will not be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed one of her Midwives bid her prepare for Death; For she could not live: To whom one of the Doctors said, that sure she had forgotten <hi>Lazarus:</hi> No (replied the Midwife) I have not forgotten him: But God must work as great a Miracle now, as he did then, if she recover. Yet for all this, it pleased God that she did recover, and afterwards one of the Doctors told Mrs <hi>VVinter,</hi> that he never saw one so near unto Death, to live; And that to him it was a Miracle. Here you see another sweet return to Doctor <hi>VVinters</hi> Prayers, and his Sister would often acknowledge that it was by the power and prevalency of his Prayers that she was restored to Life; and so others judged also. <note place="margin">A Ninth Instance.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The last time that the Soldiers pulled the Parliament in Pieces, Doctor <hi>Winter</hi> and his Friends in <hi>Dublin</hi> were in great Fears of the Confusions that were like to follow; Whereupon he kept weekly Fasts with his Congregation for a great while together? And one time as he was Praying in imitation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> praying for <hi>Sodom,</hi> he used such like expressions: <hi>Lord wilt thou also destroy the Righteous with the VVicked? Peradventure there be fifty Thousand Righteous within these three Kingdoms: VVilt thou also destroy, and not spare these Nations for fifty Thousand Righteous tbat are therein,</hi> &amp;c. And when he came to the last number of ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, as he kneeled against a Post in the Room, he saw a great shining Light about him, and heard perfectly a Voice saying: <hi>The Nations shall be spared for ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Righteous Persons sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this gracious Answer, he turned his Prayer into Praises and Thanksgivings unto God for this speedy return to his earnest Request, insomuch as all the company could not but take notice of it, tho none of them heard the Voice but himself only. Mrs. <hi>VVinter</hi> upon some occasion was absent at this time; Yet a Gentlewoman that was present told her after, that her Husband that day was so enlarged, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62667:77"/> Elevated in Prayer, that he exceeded himself, and that she never heard him do better as also that his Petitions were answered before he rose from his Knees. Mrs. <hi>VVinter,</hi> asked her, how she knew that, she answered, by his large Thanksgivings after he had done pleading with the Lord for these Nations. Also a while after, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman coming to see him, who had been present that day, embraced him, saying, that he was a man greatly beloved of the Lord, for he could no sooner ask but he was answered, and his Petition granted. And the very week after, they heard that the Pride of the Soldiers was abated, having meet with a check.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>VVinter</hi> afterwards told his Wife, that he perceived that a Voice might be spoken to one in a Room, where many were, and yet none else might hear it. And when he lay upon his Death-Bed, his Wife asked him again about it, and he said that he did as certainly and plainly hear it, as he heard her then speak: She asked, if the Voice were like unto hers? No (said he) It was another manner of Voice. Thus we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 9 <hi>That the men that went with</hi> Saul <hi>to</hi> Damascus, <hi>saw indeed the Light, and were afraid: But heard not the Voice that spake to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Dublin</hi> there was one Mrs <hi>Smith,</hi> a Merchants Wife, who had been many <note place="margin">A Tenth Instance.</note> dayes in Labor, her Child was Dead within her, she had good experienced Midwives, and one Man-Midwife, and yet she could not be delivered. At last, one Morning they sent for Doctor <hi>Winter</hi> to pray with her, telling him, that she could not live till Night she was so far spent. But it fell out that he was out of Town, when they sent. At Night he came home, and then they sent again for him, her Husband sending him Word that she was not yet Dead, but very neer unto it.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Winter</hi> (tho he was very weary) went to the House, and Prayed very earnestly unto God for her. And when his Prayer was ended, he spake to the good Women about her, to raise her up, and to use all good means for her Delivery saying, <hi>That say should Live:</hi> But they (being hopeless of her Life and Delivery, desired that she might be no more tortured, but be suffered to Die in Peace.) Yet Doctor <hi>Winter</hi> importuned them to make one tryal more, which at last they consented to, and had good success: For in a short time she was safely delivered of a Dead Child. This Mrs <hi>Smith</hi> proving afterwards with Child again; a Friend of hers said to her, she hoped now it would be better with her then it was the time before: (said she) Doctor <hi>Winter</hi> is gone, and I must now Die: which also came to pass, for she could not be Delivered.</p>
               <p>After Doctor <hi>Winter</hi> returned into <hi>England,</hi> he, with his Wife sojourned for a <note place="margin">An Eleaventh Instant.</note> Month in Doctor <hi>Drakes</hi> House, in which time his second Daughter fell sick of the twisting of her Guts: She had two able <hi>Physicians,</hi> Doctor <hi>Trench</hi> and Doctor <hi>Cox.</hi> She lay in very great Torments from <hi>Munday</hi> till <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, and the Doctors had very little Hopes of her Life. On <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Evening Doctor <hi>Winter</hi> came in, and meeting her Sister, he enquired how she did? Her Sister an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that now she thought she was very neer unto Death; For that the Doctors haveing perscribed somthing to be given her in a Spoon, her Teeth were so set that her Aunt and she had much ado to open them to put it into her Mouth: But (said she) <hi>Sir, what do you think of her.</hi> Give me (said he) a Candle that I may go into my Chamber, and anon I will tell you whether she shall Live or Die. When he came down, she meet him at the Foot of the Stairs, and asked him, what he thought of her now? He answered, <hi>Your Sister will Live.</hi> And so going up into her Chamber, he spake to his Wife, and bid her use all good means possible for her recovery: For (said he) <hi>She must not Die at this time.</hi> His Wife begged of him not to be so confident, for that she was now very near unto Death, and there were no hopes of her Recovery; Yet he told her Mother and Aunt, that she should recover and live. His wife was much troubled at it, notwithstanding her many experiences. But the next day signes of recovery began to appear, and within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle space she was perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Some other Instances of his Power and Prevalencie in Prayer might be given; But these may suffice, as evidently Demonstrating that the Lord our God is a Prayer-Hearing God: That, <hi>Never faith to the Seed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Seek ye my Face in Vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Probably the incredulous World will not believe these things to be true: But Judge them rather to be <hi>Romances,</hi> and <hi>Fancies,</hi> then Realities: But there were so many Persons of Quality and Conscience at the first publication hereof, Living, who could, and would attest the Truth of them, that there is no place left of distruct

               <head>The Life and Death of Mr. <hi>Thomas Tregoss,</hi> who died <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1670.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Tregross</hi> was born at <hi>Saint Ives,</hi> neer the Lands-end in <hi>Cornwal.</hi> The Family where of he was a Branch was not without Noble Blood running in <note place="margin">His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage.</note> its veines. Some are of opinion that it is more Ancient then the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, a Stem of the old <hi>Britans</hi> driven into and Planted in those parts. Our <hi>English</hi> History tells us that Duke <hi>William,</hi> commonly called <hi>The Conquerour,</hi> created <hi>John Tregoss</hi> a Baron, who tho he died without Issue, yet <hi>Henry Tregoss</hi> sat as a Baron in the Parliament in the Thirty Fift year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the first: And <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Tregoss</hi> was one of those Lords that sided with <hi>Simon Montford</hi> Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> against King <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>As for the ruines of this Noble Family, the principal cause thereof is very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and ought to be buried in silence. One Mr <hi>Roscadden</hi> going on <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> according to the blindness and Superstition of those times, his Wife had in his absence one, if not more Children: whereupon at his return, <hi>John Tregoss</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised and perswaded him to settle his Estate upon some Friend, for the use and benefit of his Wife and Children, lest after his Death, the Heir at common Law should turn his Wife and Children out a Doors.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Roscadden</hi> entertained, and approved the motion, and intreated him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the trust, which request <hi>John Tregoss</hi> readily embraced; But instead of a <note place="margin">Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:</note> Deed in Trust, he made it absolute to himself and his Heirs for ever. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly so soon as Mr. <hi>Roscadden</hi> was Dead, he entred upon all his Lands, and turned his Wife and Children out of Doors, who for some time, were sain to lye in an Hogstie, and every Morning went forth to the Dunghil, and there upon their Knees Imprecated and Prayed that the Vengeance of God might fall upon this <hi>Tregoss</hi> and his Posterity for this so perfidious and merciless dealing.</p>
               <p>And after this Gods severe, but Righteous Judgments fell upon <hi>Tregosses</hi> Family. <note place="margin">Plagued by God.</note> For his Son <hi>Walter</hi> one day riding upon a Horse in a fair way, the Horse threw him, and broak his neck: And some of his Issue came to untimly ends, and it is observed that a curss hath remained upon the Estate ever since: And this Mr. <hi>Thomas Tregoss</hi> of whom we now write, was so sencible of it, that it cost him many fervent Prayers to God for the removal of that dreadfull Curse, as himself assured a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Friend.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the Judgment of God upon this Family; Yet <hi>Thomas Tregosses</hi> Parents were Godly Persons, and reputed to be of the number of <hi>Old Punitans.</hi> And this was much manifested in the Religious Education of this their Son, whose <note place="margin">His Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> tender years they took care to have timely seasoned with the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and good Literature. At first indeed he seemed to be of a dull Capacity, till he was about the Age of seven Years, or somwhat after; But then he began to discover that he was of a quick apprehension and of a firm and tenatious Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And indeed he had from his youth a strong inclination to the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and would often (when he was but a Child) stand up upon a Stool, or Bench and after his manner Preach to his Play-fellows.</p>
               <p>When he had attained to a compleat measure of <hi>Grammer</hi> Learning, he was sent <note place="margin">He goes to Oxford.</note> to <hi>Oxford</hi> and admitted into <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge, under the Tuition of Mr. <hi>Francis Howel,</hi> then Fellow of the said Colledge; He soon percieved in him an awakned and quick Spirit, full of vivacity and serious intention, insomuch as he made good the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62667:78"/> Character which <hi>Aristotle</hi> gives of a hopefull young Man, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, To act vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which he shewed in whatever Eercises he was engaged in. And he did not (as too many Youths do) frustrate, and abuse the expectations of his Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, by squandering away those pretious oportunities, and encouragements afforded unto him, for the elevating of his Natural Capacity by the acquirement of <hi>Liberall</hi> Arts, and <hi>Philosophicall</hi> Sciences, wherein he made a very good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress. <note place="margin">His Blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Neither was he without a good interest in the Judgment and Esteem of Judicious and Pious Persons, as appeared by the admittance which Reverend Doctor <hi>Conant</hi> gave him, in accepting him to be a Member of his Congregation. Also whilst he continued in the University, he began to be sensible of some woundings of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sience. For one day hearing Doctor <hi>Conant</hi> upon that Text <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 4. O Ephraim, <hi>what shall I do unto thee?</hi> &amp;c. Some passages of that Sermon made so deep an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression upon him, as that his Conscience was filled with no small Terror. When he went to his Bed, he was not without fears that he should never live to see another day. When in his Study, that he should never come out alive. <note place="margin">His Terror.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And so long as the terrors of his awakned Conscience, and Sick Nights for Sin continued, he could not endure to hear a vain word, or to be a Spectator of what had but the appearance of Sin in it. Yet by degrees these Lights and heats of Conscience disappeared, and vanished away. Neither did they at that time determine and end in a thorow Conversion, as will be made more clear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>When he had spent some time in the University, he returned to <hi>Saint Ives,</hi> the place of his Nativity, and haveing there given them some tast of his Ministerial Gifts, <note place="margin">His return to St. Ives.</note> the Inhabitants of that place invited him to sit down among them, and to be their Minister. This request he at first modestly refused, but at length being overcome by their importunity, he consented to spend some time amongst them: Where <note place="margin">His Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> upon he was <hi>August</hi> the Seventeenth. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1657. in that Church solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set apart for the work of the Ministry: And there he continued by the space of two Years: A hard and close Student all the week, and a faithful and constant Preacher twice every Lords Day. <note place="margin">His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Before his departure from this Place he took to Wife one <hi>Margret Sparman,</hi> who proved a Gracious, Meek, Humble, Affectionate, and equal Yoak-fellow to him. And whilest he continued in this Town, there were two remarkable Providences that ought not to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>The first was this. The <hi>Summer</hi> after his abode among them, much of the Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">A Special Providence</note> season was expired, and no <hi>Pilchards</hi> appeared, the Sense whereof greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and afflicted the Inhabitants of the Place; That Town depending much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Pilchard</hi> Trade. Hereupon Mr. <hi>Tregoss</hi> advised, and perswaded them to joyn with him in Keeping a day of Humiliation and Prayer, unto which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, and the Duty being performed, the very next day came in a great Shole of these Fishes, whereof a considerable quantity was chaught.</p>
               <p>The other Providential Dispensation was this. The <hi>Summer</hi> following the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <note place="margin">Another.</note> having taken a great number of <hi>Pilchards</hi> upon a <hi>Saturday,</hi> all that Night was spent in ordering of them: And the Sea-men were very intent upon drying their Nets on the <hi>Lords day.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Tregoss</hi> rebuked them for: withall, giving them to understand, that they provoked the Lord deservedly to withdraw his Blessing from them, which fell out accordingly. For from that time to the end of the Fishing season they had no occasion, or oportunity of making use of their Nets again.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Saint Ives</hi> Mr. <hi>Tregose</hi> removed in <hi>October Anno Christi</hi> 1659. To the <note place="margin">His remove to Miler,</note> Vicarage of <hi>Miler</hi> and <hi>Mabe</hi> where he continued in his constancie of Study, and Preaching till he was Ejected by the Act of <hi>Ʋniformity</hi> upon that dismal day <hi>August</hi> the <hi>24th</hi> 1662. And then being prohibited, and excluded from the Publick Place of Prayer and Preaching, he ceased not to Preach in his own Family twice every <hi>Lords Day:</hi> which being known in the Neighbourhood, diverse who had the Comfort of his Ministry in publick, could not but Thirst after it in private.</p>
               <p>This being divulged and known abroad, the news of it was carried to the <hi>Lord</hi>

               <p>In <hi>September Anno Christi</hi> 1663. Mr. <hi>Tregoss</hi> removed his habitation to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Kigilliack</hi> in the Parish of <hi>Badock</hi> near unto <hi>Penrin:</hi> where he still kept up his <hi>Lords-days</hi> meetings and exercises; unto which many came flocking as Doves to their Windows. And about the beginning of <hi>October Anno Christi</hi> 1664. He and his Wife lying awake in their Bed, they felt a great Earthquake, which made that Room to tremble and quake under them, as they apprehended. And that which ministred to them great cause of admiration, was, that no one else felt the same. But this was <note place="margin">A Strange Providence</note> but a <hi>Prognostick</hi> and <hi>Symbolick</hi> Image of that trembling Heart-quake which Mr. <hi>Tregos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> shortly felt in his Conscience.</p>
               <p>For on the first of <hi>January</hi> next following, it being a <hi>Lord's day,</hi> it pleased God to direct him to Preach on that Text <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47. <hi>And that Servant that knew his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</note>
                  <hi>Lords Will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his Will, shall be beaten with many Stripes.</hi> Upon which Text he shewed what a dangerous Sin it is to Sin against Knowledge. But when the Duties of the Day were ended, the Lord brought his old Sins into his remembrance, and set them in order before him, especially one aboue the rest. Hereupon he betook himself to Duties, but drove on therein very heavily: Yet did the Lord by his Omnipotent Hand draw him on to persevere in the same.</p>
               <p>One day among the rest as he was in Duty, he was assaulted with a strong Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, grounded upon that Text. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. <hi>For ye know how that afterwards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
                  <hi>when he would have inherited the Blessing, he was rejected; For he found no place for Repentance, tho he sought it carefully with Tears.</hi> He frequently endeavor'd to shake off the Chains and Cords of the Spirit, grieving that he was bound up from the World: And his performance of Duties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>s accompanied with deadness and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: Yet the Lord held him fast to his Work; forceing him to continue and persist in a way of Seeking.</p>
               <p>Somtimes he feared that the Lord would leave him to run on in his former Sinfull <note place="margin">The Spirit of Bondage.</note> Courses; Yea, that he should not persevere to the end of one Day. But the Lord Magnified his Grace and Power above, and beyond his fears. Somtimes in reading the Holy Scriptures the Lord would set home Threatnings, and anon supported him by his Comfortable Promises, to keep him equally ballanced, between Hopes, that so he might not Sink, and Fears, that he might not Presume.</p>
               <p>Thus for about the space of five Weeks, he was detained, and kept under the Spirit of Bondage and afflicting Terrors, having all this while no discoveries of Gods Gracious disposition towards him, till about the beginning of <hi>February</hi> following: At which time he took up a resolution to discover some Sins which most burdened his Conscsence: But then, by Gods good Providence he met with a passage in one of our <hi>English</hi> Divines setting forth the Greatness and Freeness of Gods Love, and of <hi>Christs</hi> Purchass; Which the Lord setting home unto him, he was somwhat quieted and refreshed in his Soul.</p>
               <p>The next Day, which fell out to be a <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> he had a sweet, heart melting frame <note place="margin">The Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> of Spirit wrought in him for his Sins, together with a Lively Contemplation of <hi>Christs</hi> Sufferings, to which he was directed by an Eye of Faith. And now he, who form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly thought it an hard matter to shed one Tear for Sin, had now plenty. The Spirit of the Lord also bringing that Promise to his mind: <hi>I will forgive their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and remember their Sins no more.</hi> And that of <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Thomas, Reach hither thy Finger, and behold my Hands, and reach hither thy Hand, and thrust it into my Side, and be not Faithless, but Believeing:</hi> And this was much promoted by his Reading the History of <hi>Christs</hi> Passion Yet was he not without some Fears and Doubtings still: Yea, at many times these Comforts, and Encouragements signified nothing at all to him. Yet after this, he was carried on in the exercise of Duties with more Enlargements, and Affectionate Workings of Spirit then formerly, especially at times.</p>
               <p>And from this time he dated his Conversion. For albeit his Conversation, for some considerable time before was unreproachable, and his Labours in the Work of the Ministry indefatigable; Yea, and his Zeal for Non-Conformity remarkable, yet he judged the whole of his foregoing Life, Zeal, and Labors in the Ministry, to be no other then <hi>Splendida Peccata,</hi> Glittering Sins, and a continued series of Formality and Hypocrisie. And because some of his Friends, who well knew his former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62667:79"/> could not but conceive that he had the Truth of Grace before this great Turn; He discoursing with a Friend upon this point, peremtorily affirmed, that he knew certainly that he had nothing of Sincerity before this late and great Work: And withall, he bewailed the Condition of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in that generally Men were made Ministers, before they were made Christians.</p>
               <p>Yea, he was not without many and great Fears, that many who in the Judgment and Esteem of Men, go for good and able Ministers, will one Day be found to be, when they come to be weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, not so much as good and sincere Christians. These his Fears we may presume, he grounded upon his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of himself (besides other common observations) who had the repute and esteem of, good and faithful Minister, before he was a sound and faithful Christian. And that which yet added further weight in his Judgment concerning himself, was this, in that though he had been painful, and constant in the work of the Ministry some years before this, yet he could not say, That God had made him the Instrument of the conversion of any one Soul, as the Seal of his Ministry, though afterwards he begat many Sons and Daughters unto God.</p>
               <p>Some short time after this great change, which he strongly judged and concluded <note place="margin">Strange Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> to be the first sincere turning of his Soul unto God: Being brought very low, both in his Body and Spirits, he apprehended that his Death drew near. But then was that Scripture brought into his Mind, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. <hi>I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord:</hi> Yet afterward being again under strong apprehensions of his Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, he, looking into his Bible, God directed his Eye to that Portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>(Psal.</hi> 53. 5.) <hi>There were they in great fear where no fear was:</hi> which drove away that temptation: And not long after, with God's blessing thereon, by the use of means, he regained strength to go on in his Service.</p>
               <p>Some short time after this, upon a <hi>Satu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ay,</hi> being very weak in Body, and almost despairing of recovery, he went up to his Chamber, as well as his seeble Legs could <note place="margin">A strange Providence</note> carry him, where he fell down upon his Knees in Prayer: And whilst he was in this Duty, he suddenly and sensibly found, at least in his apprehension, that a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of strength was given in unto him, to his great astonishment. Whereupon he attempted to arise, and to walk, which he accordingly did, two or three turns about his Chamber, very strongly.</p>
               <p>Finding this strange alteration, he called for his Wife to come to him, who soon espied the change, finding his pale Cheeks to be clothed with their wonted colour and complexion. And now he, that not many moments before, looked upon himself as drawing near unto the very brink of the Grave, was enabled to perform the Duties of that Evening; yea, the next days Duties (being the <hi>Lords day)</hi> with much vigor and strength. And after these signal marks of the Divine favour, and assistance, aford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both to his Soul and Body, he joyned with some other Ministers and Christians in keeping a Monthly Fast to humble and afflict themselves for their own sins, and for the sins of their Families, and of the Nation. And after these his first turning to God, he found a more then ordinary assistance, both in his Studies and Ministry, the Lord casting in abundant matter, and suitable Affections in the delivery thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1665. being the <hi>Lords day,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tregoss,</hi> whilst he <note place="margin">More of them.</note> was in Prayer, was much distracted about his intended Preaching in Publick, whereunto he seemed to be drawn by a very strange, though manifest course of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which he strongly resisted, till at last he was forced to yeild. That Week he had been wondering what the Lord would do with him. He could not study as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but was induced, and over-ruled to read a Practical Discourse of <hi>Self-denial:</hi> And the Lord furnished his Meditations with many passages about Sufferings, and the Creatures Duty to be, and live in the Will of his Creator, and to resign himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his disposal. And when he had ended his reading, casting his Eye upon his Bible, the first Words he met with, were those, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 36. <hi>When he saw the Multitude he had compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as Sheep having no Shepherd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the reading of this Text he inwardly trembled, and the Lord seemed immediatly to intimate to him, that he should put on the like Bowels. But hereupon he question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with himself, where he should find such an opportunity of Preaching in Publick? And presently <hi>Mabe</hi> (which is a Daughter-Church to <hi>Milar,</hi> and had Preaching in it; only every other <hi>Lords day)</hi> was presented, and suggested to his Thoughts: And after many Reasonings, and Disputes within himself, being backward to yield to the will
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62667:79"/> of God: He at last resolved to send thither to enquire whether any Minister would be there the <hi>Lords day</hi> following? And answer was returned, that there would be none.</p>
               <p>Yet still doubting whether he might look upon this as a Call from God, he cast his Eye upon his Bible, and met with that Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 33. <hi>No Man when he hath lighted a Candle, putteth it in a secret place, or under a Bushel, but on a Candlestick, that they that come in may see the Light.</hi> This Scripture cleared all his doubts, and answered his objections, allayed all his carnal fears, and confirmed him in his resolution of Preaching in publick the next <hi>Lords day.</hi> And accordingly, when the <hi>Sabbath</hi> came, he went thither, and found the People willing to hear, and all things inviting him to embrace the present opportunity, and so he went on and preached without any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and the Lord assisted him in all the Duties till he had concluded them.</p>
               <p>The report of this Days work was soon spread abroad, and came to the Ears of Mr. <hi>Tho. Robinson,</hi> a Justice of the Peace. The next <hi>Lords day,</hi> being <hi>May</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> the Morning proving, rainy, Mr. <hi>Tregross</hi> preached in his own House, upon the Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 19. <hi>In your Patience possess ye your Souls;</hi> not expecting any disturbance that Day by reason of the fowl weather. But after the Sermon was ended, Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> came <note place="margin">He is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted.</note> to his Door, and having entred, took the Names of those that were present: And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Mr. <hi>Tregoss</hi> to put in Sureti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After Mr. <hi>Robinsons</hi> departure, they met again in the Afternoon, and went through with the Duties without any disturbance. The next <hi>Lords day</hi> he preached again at <hi>Mabe</hi> without interruption. But when the Exercises were finished, he was served <note place="margin">His second Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> with a Warrant to appear before Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> at <hi>Hellestone</hi> on the <hi>Tuesday</hi> following. At his appearance he justified his Preaching with much evidence, and boldness. But notwithstanding all that he said, he was sent to <hi>Lancestone</hi> Gaol, there to remain for three Months. This he submitted to, not only patiently, but joyfully. In his passage to Prison he embraced all opportunities for the comfirming, and comforting of such Christian Friends as he met with by the way. And whilst he continued in Prison, his Spirit was very free, and much enlarged with those Divine influences, and refreshings which God gave in to him.</p>
               <p>He spent his time in Prison in Reading the Holy Scriptures, in heavenly Meditations, in Fasting, Prayer, Holy Conference with, and Preaching to such as were his Prison Fellows, or that came to visit him. Few there were that came to him, but either they <note place="margin">His Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</note> did, or might be great gainers by conversing with him. Now the time of his imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being expired, <hi>July</hi> the <hi>29th,</hi> he was set at liberty, and after his return home he took the first convenient opportunity of keeping a Day of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> for the many experiences that he had of Gods goodness and mercies to him and his, during all the time of his Confinement.</p>
               <p>But he had not been at home above four Days, when Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> gave out, that he would'speedily send him back to the Place from whence he came: And in order thereunto, upon the <hi>Friday</hi> or <hi>Saturday</hi> after, he prepared himself to ride to the Market, there (as it were reported) to meet with another Justice of the Peace, who should joyn with him in a Warrant for a second Conviction of Mr. <hi>Tregoss</hi> for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticler, and to prosecute some others also.</p>
               <p>But whilst he was at a Tenement of his, his own Bull (which was never known to have hurt any before) followed him in a Field with much fury, and gave him some <note place="margin">Persecutors plagued by God.</note> mortal Wounds whereof he died soon after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> the <hi>20th,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tregoss</hi> went again and Preached at <hi>Mabe</hi> Church, it being the <hi>Lords day;</hi> and he went through with his work without any disturhance: The like he did on that Day Fortnight after; spending the intervals with much activity in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Service elsewhere. Yet had he many disswasives by Christian Friends from Preaching publickly; but al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Arguments which they urged, could not satisfie his Conscience: And therefore <hi>September</hi> the <hi>18th,</hi> he was again committed to <hi>Lanceston</hi> Goal for publick Preaching: Whither he went with comfortable persuasions that God would be with, and carefully protect and provide for himself and his Family, which <note place="margin">His third Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> God made good to the uttermost.</p>
               <p>This his Second imprisonment in that place, conduced much, through the Lords blessing, to the good of many Souls. For the report of his Bonds being spread abroad many came to visit him, to whom he imparted freely his Spiritual Gifts, and by God's Blessing upon his labours, some <hi>Onesimus</hi>'s were begotten through the Gospel, in his Bonds.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:62667:80"/>
               <p> During this Imprisonment he took several Opportunities of Visiting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">His Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</note> Prisoners, whom he endeavoured to convince of their Sins, and there dangerous estate by reason of the same, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Also while he was under this Confinement he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many Divine Suavities, and Spiritual refreshments in his Soul, especially in the time of Duties: He had also many sweet and gracious returns to his Prayers; and some Prophetick intimations of future Providences.

               <p>Again, <hi>October</hi> the <hi>27th.</hi> Being earnestly praying for the Nation, he was sttongly induced to believe that some great Judgment was not far off: About which time there was often brought into his mind, and cast into his Thoughts that Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Isa.</hi> 21. 16. <hi>Thus saith the Lord unto me, within a Year, according to the Years of an Hireling, and all the Glory of Kedar shall fall.</hi> He oft-times mentioned to some of his intimate Friends, what strong impressions this Scripture made upon his Thoughts, much wondring what it should mean: But a little before the Year exspired, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful burning of <hi>London</hi> hapned, which fully Interpreted those afore-named Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the <hi>14th.</hi> He was delivered out of Prison, and upon his return home he <note place="margin">His delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of Prison.</note> kept a Day of <hi>Thanksgiving;</hi> and shortly after he set apart every <hi>Tuesday,</hi> which he kept as a Day of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> either with his Family, or with others more publickly. <hi>January</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> being the <hi>Lords day,</hi> he went to <hi>Mabe,</hi> where he Preached both parts of the Day without interruption, which was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with this remarkable Providence, that whilst he was at <hi>Mabe,</hi> a Constable, with an Officer from <hi>Pendennis Castle,</hi> came to his House to seek him, but by that <note place="margin">A special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> means missed of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> He begun a Journey towards the <hi>East</hi> part of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and from thence he went into <hi>Devonshire.</hi> And the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and the <hi>Wednesday</hi> following his <note place="margin">Another.</note> House was searched for him; but Providence ordering his being from home, he escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Hands. In this Journey he went forth on the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and returned by the <hi>North,</hi> exercising in all Places where he came, and received great encouragement by the fruit of his Labours.</p>
               <p>At his return, <hi>February</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> going to Preach at <hi>Mabe,</hi> the Constable served him with a Warrant, to carry him under the Custody of the <hi>Mareschal,</hi> as a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and seditious Person; which yet he was so far from being guilty of, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Preaching, nor Conference he ever medled with the present <hi>Discipline,</hi> or <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the Church, much less with any State-affairs. Nay, he perswaded others to be obedient to the Higher Powers: And in his dayly exercises he put up many fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Petitions for the Kings Majesty.</p>
               <p>Being now under the Custody of the <hi>Mareschal</hi> of <hi>Bodmin,</hi> this his imprisonment <note place="margin">His fourth Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> brought him into acquaintance with several Persons who reaped much good, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by his Ministry. The <hi>Mareschal</hi> used him civilly, yet did he meet with more difficulties then in his former Confinements: But yet the Lord honoured him with the Conversion of many Souls. And he continued in this Prison till about the midst of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, Anno Christi</hi> 1667. And being on a time very earnest in Prayer for his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a portion of Scripture was presented to his Thoughts, which made so deep an impression upon him; as that he was raised to a great con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dence, that if he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <note place="margin">His release by the King.</note> it should be by an Order from the Kings Majesty. And not long after, whilst he was under various Afflictions concerning his Family, the <hi>Mareschal</hi> received a special Order from the Kings Majesty for his enlargement.</p>
               <p>In <hi>February, Anno Domini</hi> 1668. coming to <hi>Penrin</hi> to Preach his <hi>Munday</hi>'s Lecture, <note place="margin">His Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</note> he fell sick of a Fever, which held him all that Week. And upon the <hi>Lords day</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the sence of his own weakness did somwhat affect him, because the People, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon his Ministry, had none to supply his room: whereupon he had that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture impressed upon his Thoughts, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 31. <hi>They that wait on the Lord shall renew</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:62667:80"/>
                  <hi>their strength,</hi> &amp;c. This wrought so much upon him, that he resolved to arise: But all his Friends that were about him laboured to disswade him from his purpose, knowing <note place="margin">His strange recovery.</note> how weak he was, but they could not prevail. And when he had got on his Cloaths, he applyed himself to his Lords work; and as he proceeded, and went on in it, strength by degrees, was given in to him, so that he Preached thrice that <hi>Lords day,</hi> choosing that Text afore-named <hi>[Isa.</hi> 40. 31.] for his Subject; and to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and astonishment, as well of himself as of his Friends and Auditors, he found himself well at Night, neither did he feel so much as any relicts of his Distemper after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Year 1669. the number of his Auditors was so much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, <note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Penrin.</hi>
                  </note> as that the Rooms wherein they usually met would not contain them, which occasioned the removal of their Meeting into a large Barn, until, being summoned by the <hi>Proprietor</hi> of that Barn, to quit his House, he thereupon took up his Habitation in the Town of <hi>Penrin.</hi> Yet before his removal, a <hi>Mittimus</hi> came from the Quarter Sessions, grounded upon an Information given in by the Bishop of the Diocess, to send him to the Goal at <hi>Lanceston,</hi> for Preaching publickly.</p>
               <p>The Constables coming to serve the Warrant, one of them more violent and furious <note place="margin">A Strange Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> then his fellows, whilst he reasoned with Mr. <hi>Tregoss,</hi> holding the <hi>Mittimus</hi> in his Hand, sunk down in the place, seeming at the present to be dead: But by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent endeavours of those about him, he was brought to himself again, whereupon he departed without executing the Warrant. And that which made this the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, was, for that this Constable was a lusty strong Man, and never sainted in all his Life before. And though they came again, some days after, to execute the Warrant, yet had they not power to carry him to Prison: For which (as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) the other Constable was Fined at the next Sessions.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Summer Assizes, Anno Christi</hi> 1669. Mr. <hi>Tregoss</hi> having some Affairs which called him to <hi>Lanceston,</hi> in his Journey he was invited to visit some part of the <hi>North west</hi> parts of <hi>Devonshire;</hi> from whence, for Preaching in a private House in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of <hi>Great Torrington,</hi> he was sent to <hi>Exeter Gaol,</hi> with several others of the <note place="margin">He is sent to <hi>Exeter.</hi> Goal, but bailed.</note> Town, and of <hi>Bideford;</hi> who being all Bailed, had for that time no other trouble then to <hi>Travers</hi> a Bill for a Riot, which was preferred against them.</p>
               <p>In his return from <hi>Exon,</hi> he spent some few days at <hi>Crediton,</hi> in which place he contracted an intimate Friendship with a Person, who was Providentially cast there at that time, to whom he disclosed and unbosomed many of the choisest accidents, which befel him in most of his Life. And albeit they never saw each other afterwards, yet this Friendship was preserved inviolably, improved by Paper-Conversation, till Death made a disunion, or rather a Suspension for the present. This trouble which befell Mr. <hi>Tregoss</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> was an occasion of much good to many Souls in those parts; For it opened a Door to many Hundreds in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> who resorted to him in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and so became partakers of his Ministerical Gifts, which (through the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Divine Grace) were very effectual for the good of their Souls.</p>
               <p>This made him to lay out himself Day and Night to the utmost of his Strength, <note place="margin">His Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</note> allowing his Body no more then extream necessity required, that so he might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all advantages and opportunitys for the advancement of his Masters Service. The Bill which had been preferred against him at <hi>Exeter,</hi> necessitated him to attend the two following <hi>Assizes,</hi> where he was at last freed by Proclamation. But in the mean while, his return into those parts was of no small advantage for the Propagation of the Gospel. Some of those Persons who discovered their Malice against Mr. <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goss,</hi> for Preaching at <hi>Torrington,</hi> were shortly after taken away by unnatural Deaths, not without some signal tokens of Gods displeasure against them, as will appear by this his following Letter to an intimate Friend.</p>

The Lord more fully warn them who survive, and us also, of those black, and tempting days which, probably, are near us.

               <p>After Mr. <hi>Tregoss</hi> came to reside at <hi>Penrin,</hi> he hired a House for a Meeting-place on the <hi>Lords day</hi> in the Parish of <hi>Mabe,</hi> where he Exercised without interruption, from <hi>Midsummer, Anno Christi</hi> 1669. to the Tenth of <hi>May,</hi> 1670. After which day there were two debauched Persons that turned Informers, hoping thereby to get <note place="margin">God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> fuel for their Lusts: who having procured a Warrant, required the Officers to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them evety <hi>Lords day,</hi> and made Oath against Mr. <hi>Tregoss</hi> and some others for a breach of the <hi>Statute</hi> then in force against <hi>Conventicles:</hi> This scarred away most of his Hearers, especially those that had any considerable Estates. Yet, though there were many Fines laid upon him, which amounted to 220 <hi>l.</hi> yet the Lord so ordered things, as nothing he had was seized upon.</p>
               <p>This Meeting being thus dissolved and broken, he resolved to drive the Nail that would go, and to Preach the oftner to a <hi>Statute-number:</hi> And herein his labours were so many and great, as though his Body were of Steel, yet could he not long hold out. For he Preached five times every <hi>Lords day,</hi> and in the Evening made Repetition <note place="margin">His extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. pains.</note> of some part. He also continued the <hi>Tuesdays,</hi> and <hi>Thursdays</hi> Exercises, besides some others. He was often advised by his Friends to favour himself, and to moderate his pains: But the great Zeal he had for the keeping it on, and advancing the work of God did stop his Ears against all disswasives of this kind: But having at last worn out himself, and exhausted his Spirits, he fell into a Griping of the Bowels, occasioned by a <hi>Flatus Hypochondriachus,</hi> or Melancholly Wind, as his <hi>Physician</hi> affirmed; which brought him so low and weak, that his Friends judged him to be past recovery; and he himself expressed a longing desire to be dissolved, and to be with <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Lord was pleased to reprieve him for a little longer, and set him once more upon his Feet, though he took not the Air. And as soon as he perceived a small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of his strength, he began to fall upon his work again: Yet this continued but for a very short time, before a Feaver seized on him, and put an end to all his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <note place="margin">His last Sickness.</note> and Troubles. His deportment during both times of his Sickness was like his Life, very sweet and heavenly. Upon the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> perceiving the Hour of his Dissolution to draw near, and be at hand, he took his Farewell of his Friends in a long Speech, whereof you have a part: as followeth,</p>

Did we think that after so many Fasting, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation Days, after so many Thanksgiving Days, after so many Sacrament Days, we should see such a Day as this? O! But it may be, you will ask me such a Question as this: Do you realy believe that you shall Die? Indeed, Friends, there is nothing but Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency that can bear me up. And if you ask what I think of my self? Truly Friends, I can say, that I have walked among you by the pure Copy of the Holy Scriptures, and Life of</hi> Christ: <hi>And through the Grace of God in</hi> Christ Jesus, <hi>I shall be presented spotless to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

                  <hi>Indeed when I was young I had my youthly Vanities; but in the Year</hi> 1664. <hi>upon a</hi> New-years-day <hi>the Lord was pleased to meet with me, and then, and then, even then did he set all my Sins before me. And those very Sins which were small to me before, were, by the Spirit of the Lord in that Rod, made as bitter as Death it self: My slight Child-hood sins; my slender youthful sins, were now to me very hainous, and abominable. Wherefore, my Friends, I charge you to make Conscience of those sins: Yea, of the least of them which I have warned you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Some may think me Passionate, and some may think me severe and uncharitable; but now I repent that I had not dealt more impartially and plainly with you. However, in the Truth of the Lord, according to mine ability, I have walked among you: And I hope that you will not think it tedious if I drop a few Words upon my Grave before I die. Then the</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician <hi>stopping him, intending to desire him to leave off speaking, lest he should spend his Spirits too much, Mr.</hi> Tregoss said,</p>

I am going to my great, to my dear Father, to my best Friend, to him in whom I have Believed His Face I hope to see; in his Bosom I hope to lye down this Day. Oh! What unspeakable Glory is it to see the Glory of mine Everlasting God? O my Friends! I must tell you the Truth: Though sometimes there have been upon my pbantasie strange black Clouds, which made me to speak somewhat inconsistent, and were suddenly blown off again; yet little doth any one know the reviving Incomes I had then, even then from my God: And the last</hi> Lords day <hi>at Nlght, the Lord gave me some sweet turns with himself: O! It was a pleasant N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And, now my Friends, I must tell you,</hi> that through many Tribulations you must enter into the Kingdom of God: <hi>Some of you have told me your Thoughts concerning me, That I have walked in all good Conscience towards God and Man. O Friends! Whatsoever things ye have seen in me that were honest; whatsoever things were just; whatsoever things were of good report, pursue those things. Rely not upon the World; for the World will leave you cold and helpless. And now Friends, I must go to see the Lord, and this Body of mine must be laid in the Dust, and never rise more until the Resurrection Day. And must ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you go from this place, and come naked before the Face of God? O Friends, If there be any Hope; if there be any Love; if there be any Consolation in you, think on these things? You know I have. When I came to this Town, some may think I came to fill an empty Bag, and to get a livelihood among this People: But, God is my Witness, I had not this in mine Eye. I sought not yours, but you. And now Friends, Flesh, and Blood will say, 'tis hard to part with dear Friends, to part with a Dear Wife, to part with Dear Children: But as the Lord hath given them to me, so I now leave them with the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I call you to Witness that I leave this dear Wife of mine with the Lord: and these dear Children of mine with the Lord, and to be protected by him; to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him; to be kept blameless to the Day of his appearance. Though Men may prove unkind unto them, as I suppose they will; yet the Lord, I know, will not. I must into Enternity. The Prophets do not live for ever; Neither can they Prophesie for ever. I have been but a young Branch, and you see, the Lord is cuting me down this. Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. O Blessed Lord God! shall there not be a meeting in</hi> Paradise? <hi>Shall not thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant see thee, and love thee, and embrace thee, and be embraced by thee? Oh Lord! Give a good evidence to thy Servant, that he may know that he belongeth to thee.</hi>
               </p>

He must away to serve the Lord in his upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. He must away, Lord, and never look on these Earth things more. And, now O Friends, one I thing tell you; I shall come again with my Lord in most excellent Glory; and you then must come before him. But I fear, I fear, that then some of you will be in a very low, poor, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition. Well, I commend you to the Love, and Grace of God, the Eternal Father in</hi> Jesus Christ. <hi>And I pray you get your Hearts full of the Love of God, and of the Grace of God, and full of the Holy Ghost. And now think on these things that I have delievred unto you, in the Name of the Lord! I must go, and deliver up my accounts to God: And O, that I may deliver them up freely: That I may he able to say: I have run my Race; I have finished my Course: I have fought the good Fight: I have kept the Faith: And what remains but that I receive the Crown which the</hi> Lord Jesus, <hi>the Righteous Judge hath prepared for me. And now I commit my self to the Lord: And my Wife and Children to the Lord: I commit my Spirit to thee, O Father of Spirits.

               </p>
               <p>These Words he spake with a more audible, and clear voice then he was wont to do in his ordinary Preaching. And about an Hour and an half after he had ended this <note place="margin">His Death.</note> Speech, he departed this Life, <hi>January</hi> the <hi>18th. Anno Christi</hi> 1670.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tregross</hi> was of a middle Stature, his Hair Black, his Face palish, not perfectly round, nor long. His Spirit was Masculine, Generous, and Great, agreeable to the <note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> Condition of his Ancestors. There was a sparkling vivacity apparent in most of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense Actions. His natural Humour was not morose, but Assable; yet was he not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a tincture of dark Melancholly, which yet his Grace improved to a great measure of seriousness. He had also some sparks of Choller, which being spirited with warm Affections for God, brake forth in a pure Flame of Divine Zeal. His natural Judgment seemed deep and solid; his Will firm, and fixed; His Memory tenatious and faithful: His Affections tender and active. And the whole capacity of his Soul fit for great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
               <p>But the more Illustrious and bright part of his Character regardeth his gracious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and Dispositions. His Personal Holiness was eminent and remarkable. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, <note place="margin">His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> few in this Age, have, for so short standing, made a larger proficiency in the Learning, and School of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Service. After <hi>January, Anno Christi</hi> 1664. (From whence he Dated his Conversion) he banished both from his Heart and Life many Vanities whith he had been addicted to. Neither did he acquire his Godliness at so easie a rate as most Professors do. No, his Heart was first deeply wounded for sin, and afterwards delivered from it. He was for some while under many and great extremities by reason of a Spirit of Bondage, which yet made way for a Spirit of a Adoption. He was throughly and soundly convinced of his Spiritual Death by Sin, and that opened to him a Door of Life by <hi>Christ.</hi> And the intire change of his Heart much appeared, in the Change of his Life; and in his last end. Neither had he some particular Graces only, but a Combination, and complication of many amiable Graces, seemingly opposite, appeared visibly in him. How affable, and courteous was he, and yet how severe against Sin? What Meekness and Humility in his own cause? And yet what Courage, and Magnanimity in the cause of God, shone in him? How much fear, and Holy self-jealousie, and yet how much Christian boldness, and confidence was he possessed with? What an inflexible, and strong bent for God, and against sin seemed he to bave? And yet how flexible and complying with others for their Good was he?</p>
               <p>He did not, as some, take <hi>Christ</hi> to ease himself of his work, or to secure his Lusts, but to kill them, and to quicken himself to Duty. His Peace of Conscience was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, <note place="margin">His Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> not by Peace, but by War with sin: It was not only from, but in God: He had not only a form of <hi>Christ</hi> in his Life, and Picture of him in his Fancy; but also the Image of, Union with, and Love for <hi>Christ</hi> in his Heart. He affected not so much to entangle his Thought with Disputes about the Controversies of Religion, as to get the Power of it stamped upon his own, and others Souls. His Faith did not lye level with Worldly Interest, but was opposite thereto. He climbed not, as some, to the top of an high Profession, without laying a deep Foundation in Self-denial: He bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed not, as too many do, the Mask of Religion to conceal a rotten Heart: but was unsatisfied in his Heart-enquires after Grace, till he arrived to such a full measure thereof, as is not attainable by any Hypocrite.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:62667:83"/>
               <p> His daily Progress in the Mortification of Sin, was very remarkable, and conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <note place="margin">His Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> He knew full well that one reigning Lust would darken his Comfort, and harden his Heart; yea, bring all into Bondage and Captivity, and therefore he durst not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie any Lust in the least. He was content to give up every Lust to death for <hi>Christ,</hi> who gave up his Soul to Death for him. He thought it not much to part with any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sin for him who was his Beloved Saviour. Yea, he seemed to take more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in subduing his unlawful Desires, then others do in gratifying, and fulfilling them. And lest his Flesh should impose upon his more noble part, he enured, and accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to many Bodily severities, and denied himself of such Natural refreshments, which most others indulge themselves in. Yet did he not content himself with exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mortifications, but maintained a daily Conflict with the whole Body of Sin in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature. Yea, he would oft blame himself much for Spiritual sins; as Infidelity, Pride, unbelief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which others could least blame him for.</p>
               <p>His weanedness from, and Crucifixion to the World was not less visible than his other <note place="margin">His Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion to the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ld.</note> Graces He seemed to have acquired a great indifferency of Spirit for things indifferent: To allow perishing things, but perishing Affections. As our blessed Lord <hi>Christ</hi> gave his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for him, so he thought it not much to give his Earth for his Lord: He could not part with <hi>Christ</hi> for any Worldly Good, and therefore was willing to part with all for <hi>Christ.</hi> The firm, believing views he had of future Glories, obscured, and darkened the Worlds Glories to him, so that he seemed to admire nothing but approaching Glorys; or what related thereto. Poverty in <hi>Christ</hi>'s way was great Riches to him; yea, far greater then a flourishing Estate in the ways of Sin. He knew how to abound in his wants, by contentedly wanting what the Lord though not fit for him; and thereby Crucifying his Desires, he made the Cross of <hi>Christ</hi> the more easie to him. His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires were low, and therefore his Spirit was high above the frowns, and flatteries of this lower World, He seemed far better pleased in his mean and low condition, then Worldlings are in their highest. His Mind was too great to put a great estimate upon the empty <hi>Nothings</hi> of this Life. He brought his Natural desires into a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, and thence gained a great enlargment of Spirit.</p>
               <p>By his frequent and long Sufferings he gained a great skill and dexterity in bearing <note place="margin">His art in bearing the Cross.</note> the Cross. By starving sin, and crucifying his Heart to the World, he took out the stings of his Sufferings. He knew that the Divine Will was more eligible then his own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he endeavoured to conform unto it, as well by <hi>Passive</hi> as by <hi>Active</hi> Obedience. He knew that he could not glorifie God more, then by being content that God's Glory should gain by his private losses. He durst not make Sin a shelter against Sufferings: Or bear false witness against God, by repining under the Cross. He was not so well pleased with sin, as to perfer it before sufferings: or so ill pleased with Sufferings as to fly from them, when he was called thereunto. Heinured himself to the Yoak of <hi>Christ,</hi> and so gain'd the Art of bearing his Cross. His Conscience continued under a lively sense of Sin, and that made him Dead, and in a measure sensless under sufferings. His will was so far broken, as that it could chearfully bend, and submit to the Cross; yea, to welcome Crosses, when in God's way he met with them. When God brought him into any Affliction, or Suffering, he waited there till God brought him out. He knew himself to be nothing, and that made him to bear any thing from God with contentment: And by knowing his own vileness, he learn'd to justifie God in every cross. His Spirit was generous &amp; noble, like that of the Eagle which is not clamorous when it wants Food. He studied <hi>Passive</hi> obedience as well as <hi>Active:</hi> To be well pleased with what God did, as well as to do what was well-pleasing unto God.</p>
               <p>He had a fit disposition, and qualification for the Cross, which made that easie to him which seemed intollerable unto others. As he durst not make men Lords of his Faith, so neither of his Happiness, by doteing on their Smiles, or fearing their Frowns; but as Worldy men content themselves with the World without God, so he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to content himself with God without the World. He had his present wants supplyed, by Ordinary, or Extraordinary ways and means, and therefore conceived it to be his Duty to trust God for the future. He knew that he had more of the Creature then b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> deserved, and therefore was not anxious, and solicitous about ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more. He was much taken up about the weighty things of Eternity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was little concerned about these lower, and baser things.</p>
               <p>He had many Noble and Generous Dispositions, and Qualifications, but no one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more illustrious, and visible in him, after his Conversion, then his Zeal for <note place="margin">His Zeal for God.</note> and in, his Masters Service, and the good of Souls. O! What a rare, and excellent Qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is a Publick Spirit for God? And how much was this holy Man invested, and adorned herewith? How little did his hot and flaming Zeal care to live, when the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62667:83"/> Honour of his great Lord seemed to bleed and die? How <hi>Moses</hi> like was he in Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as to injuries done unto himself? And yet how impatient, and <hi>Elias</hi> like, as to injuries done unto his Lord? How modest and backward was he in his own cause? and yet how Magnanimus, and undoubted in the cause of God? How little was it in the power of the greatest men to frown him out of Duty, or to flatter him into Sin? what a Masculine Courage had he, joyned with a fixed resolution not to displease God to please Men? Yea, how much vigour, and strength did his Zeal gain by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition? He seemed indeed naturally to have an <hi>Heroick</hi> Spirit, put how much did Grace transform this natural quality into a Divine Zeal? How much of Divine flame, and how little of wild-fire, and sinful wrath was there in his Zeal?</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding his ardent zeal for God, yet was he of a very quiet and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit. He did not <hi>(Salamanden-</hi>like) delight to live in the Fire of Contention, <note place="margin">His Catholick Charity.</note> but was of a uniting, healing Spirit. He was not only a Patient, but also an Agent in seeking after, and persuing Peace. He judged our Church-divisions to be one of our greatest Plagues. He had a <hi>Catholick</hi> Universal Charity, and love for all: And albeit he hated the vices of wicked and ungodly men, yet he loved their Persons. But he had a special and perticular affection for all Saints, and that as Saints, making their Graces not their Opinions, the measure of his love. His Spirit; and Principles were so peaceable, as that he desired to avoid all needless disputes, that might breed strife. But when he was called to dispute, or to confer with those of different Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he shewed forth much modesty, and meekness; Arguing not for Glory and Victory, but to inquire into Truth; Wherein he affirmed nothing, but what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured plainly and soundly to prove out of the Scriptures; and when he could not fully comply with other mens <hi>perswasions,</hi> yet would he not impose his own on them, as the Rule of their Faith, or Communion.</p>
               <p>And tho he could forbear, and bear with all for their good, yet he could not bear with Sin in any, but was a severe Admonitor, and Reprover thereof in all. Yea, <note place="margin">His dexterity in admonitions and reproofs</note> his very presence was a powerful and perswasive admonition to such as he reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For there was so much gravity and sweetness mixed in his countenance, that one word from him would oft effect more, then many from some others, especially by his Holy Conversation, exemplifying what he urged upon others. From the Word of God he much convinced such as were defective in their Duty, and subdued their wills to the will of God. I my self (saith mine Author) heard him, in the presence of several Ministers, sharply reproving the sins of Ministers in mispending their time whilst they were together, in frothy and unprofitable Conferences, which reproof he managed with so much majesty, and yet with so much Humility and submission, confirming all that he pressed from the Word of God, that all that were present could not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there was much of God in his so seasonable admonition and reproof.</p>
               <p>Neither did his severity extend to the Sins of others only, but also to his own. He was a diligent, and curious observer of his own Spirit, its ends, intentions, <note place="margin">His self exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> inclinations, motions, risings and fallings, as to Sin, or Grace. He alwayes kept a vigilant eye over his Heart, and every Night made perticular reflexions, on the passages of the Day past, with a strict examination how he had spent it: What his Conversation had been towards others? and how he had demeaned himself in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Duties towards God? He examined, not only what he had done, but also from what Principles he had done it. And thus, by the knowledg of what he had done, he came the better to know what he was to do; By studying well the book of his own Heart and life, he became a good Student, and proficient in the mystery of Godliness, and of Sin. He was a Man of great observation, and of nothing more than of his own Spirit, its various vicissitudes, turnings, and windings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he came to have an intimate, and thorow acquaintance with his own Heart, and an experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sense of the Holy Spirits working in him. Hence also he came to know what Sins he had to confess, and humble himself for. What Mercies to bless God, or to petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for: What burdens to groan under. At sometimes he found himself under great deadness and distractions: At other times under sweet inspirations and breathings of the Holy Spirit, and enlargements of Heart. Sometimes he sighed under sinking despondencies, black unbeliefe, and base Fears; At other times he was upon the wing of Faith, and full of courage.</p>
               <p>He had his stated times for private and Family Duties. Faith and Prayer were his chiefe refuge in all his troubles. And indeed he seemed to drive a great Trade with <note place="margin">His private Duties.</note>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:62667:84"/> Heaven by Prayer, wherein he was very powerful and prevalent. He had a very strugling, wrestling Spirit in Prayer, bottomed upon a deep sense of his own need, large desires, and lively workings of Faith. What strength he gained by Prayer, he lost not by careless neglects after Prayer, but improved it for God. His Spirit seemed unsatisfied in duty till he had met with God or something from God. Sometimes he was dull and indisposed in the beginning of a Duty; but before he came off, he found great assistance. When he found weakness the Lord gave in unexpected supplies of strength. When he was dejected or cast or cast down under any perplexing, disturbing fears, or difficulties from within, or from without, he had recourse to his Bible, and thence received frequently such sweet, and encouraging Promises, set home by the Spirit of God, as afforded abundance of refreshing, and reliefe to him.</p>
               <p>His Family Exercises and Discipline deserve a perticular remark. He gave no tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration to any known Sin, or omission of any Duty: He was very vigilant and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <note place="margin">His Family Government.</note> in preventing, or reproving the profanation of the <hi>Lords Dayes,</hi> even to idle words. Neither was he less careful of the Pious Education, and instruction of those under his Domestick charge. Every Morning and Evening, for the most part, he read, and expounded a part of the Sacred Scriptures, sung a <hi>Psalm,</hi> and Prayed with them. Every <hi>Friday</hi> night he examined their proficiency in learning, the <hi>Assemblies lesser Catechism,</hi> explaining some part thereof unto them. Every <hi>Lords day</hi> at night (besides other Duties) he delivered the substance of what had that Day been preached in the Sermons. And after such exercises he examined his Servants, and such chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as were capable of what they remembred, not suffering any under his charge, who would not give an account of their Faith, and progress in knowledge. When he did not read a Chapter his course was to examine and instruct his Servants concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of Religion, which was a great means of improving their knowledge. And, besides his private retirements and Family Duties, he had his set and stated times every Day to spend with his Wife in private Prayer.</p>
               <p>Neither was this his Religious care of instructing Souls confined only to his own Family, but it extended unto others also. He was endowed and invested with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <note place="margin">His holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> Gift of personal conference, which talent he carefully imployed for the good of many Souls; Being ready to take, yea to seek all convenient opportunities to treat with them about their Eternal estate. He was much in pressing Men unto Holiness. He was wont to propose questions to those with whom he conversed, and desired the like of them, which course the Lord made very successful. He esteemed it no small burden to be cast into any Company, where his time was spent in unprofitable Discourse, and when he was, by Providence, cast upon such, his manner was to put a stop to such unedifying conference, by spiritual Divertisments, or turning it to some Holy Discourse. When he intended to visit any Christian Family, his Method was; First to call his Wife and Mother, that they might joyn with him in Prayer for a Blessing on his intended undertaking; And being greatly sensible of the advantages that are acquired by Christian conference, he gave those of his Hearers, whom he judged most judicious, diverse directions for the right management thereof upon all occasions.</p>
               <p>He had a great tenderness and regard to such as were sick: And when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of their sickness he stayed not till he was sent for, and invited to come to <note place="margin">His visitation of the Sick.</note> them, neither did he rudely intrude were he could not expect to be welcome; but first imployed a Friend that might intimate his willingness, and readiness to come to them; And then, where he might be received, he failed not to visit them, and to administer such spiritual advice and conusel as he judged to be most proper for the state of their Souls: And to those who wanted a competent supply of conveniences he imparted not only of his Spiritual, but also of his temporal Gifts, according to what God had blessed him withal. He failed not to pray with them before his departure, and not to spare any labor or trouble in the discharge of this Christian Office and duty.</p>
               <p>As for other more extensive parts of his Ministerial Gifts and labors, they were also very remarkable. His preaching was sollid and practical. He had a great <hi>pathos</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Ministerial Gifts and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> and vehemency in seting home Truths upon the Conscience. His Sermons were full of plainness, and yet clothed with a Sacred Majesty. His words were familiar and yet very efficatious. He dwelt much upon awakning Truths, such as might pierce and sting the Conscience of secure Sinners. And yet to such as needed consolation, he was another <hi>Barnabas,</hi> full of sweetness. He had much of the Divine assistance
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62667:84"/> as well in composing, as in the hearing Sermons. He oft said, <hi>That usually his Sermons were given him upon his knees.</hi> His manner and practice was, when he had pitched on a Text, to apply himself to Prayer, and whilst he was in that Duty, he had oft the Heads of his discourse given in unto him. As for enlargements, he was never barren, having a faithful Memory that treasured up all that he read, and an Elocution apt and able to deliver what he had so treasured up, upon all occasions. Those that knew him much admired that he could preach so oft, and yet so well. He was likewise endowed with a large and excellent Gift in Prayer, which he alwayes expressed in Scriptural Language, wherein he seemed to have much communion with God.</p>
               <p>In brief, he was one of divine Lights and Heats for God. His zeal, in promoting <note place="margin">His Characte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in brief.</note> the wayes of God and his Glory, was ardent, and flaming. He was affable and courteous in his Speech; Serious and Grave in his carriage and deportment: Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his Courage; Charitable to such as differed from him in their <hi>perswasions,</hi> so long as he saw that their design was to promote Godliness and Holiness. Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate he was in the use of the Creatures. Frugal in husbanding of his precious time. Spending his spare Hours in walking, meditating, Praying, and conversing with Christians about their Soul-affairs. And indeed, he was of so Holy and Heavenly a disposition and temper, as all good Men, who knew him, reverenced him. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, his greatest ambition seemed to be this, to act and suffer something more than ordinary for God, that so he might by a singular exemplary conversation, silence the reproaches of ungodly Men, and give check to the pride, vanity, and carnality of too many Professors in these wanton Dayes, which he sadly bewailed, as a shrewd <hi>Prognostick</hi> and presage of future desolations: Only he hoped there were some, and that the Lord would raise up more young Converts, who should be furnished with Spirits, and conversations for the enlargement of <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But more of his Hopes, Fears, and frame of his Spirit will appear by, and in these following Letters.</p>

                     <p>I May tell you sad stories of my Heart; O! how unbelieving, fearful, and faint found I it, on those short views I took of it: But that God, on whom my scandalous Heart hath raised so many false stories heretofore, and then gave my fears the lie, and yet continue I untouch't, and undisturbed to this hour. I do cast my self upon the disposing hand of God, to live and dye in my liberty, according to his pleasure. When I go forth, not expecting to see my Family again, and my frequent escapes, fill me with pleasing admirations of love, that (thro Grace) I return triumphing in his Goodness. How long this liberty may be indulged, I know not: But I know he will be a good God when he seizeth our freedom in the Gospel; And it will be the Rod of a Father, and may tend to our increase and settlement. I have had one very strange raising from the Grave since I saw you, the circumstances whereof compelled me and others to own a very visible finger of God; But a Narrative of this would be too tedious. I desire you would be importunate with God, that I might eye the approaching Glory, and the return of that great Shepheard, and might feed in hope, singly aiming at the Lords blessed interest, being contented with mine own greatest Decreases, might that be encreased and enlarged. Gods waterings and blessings must give life and fruit to all our poor and defective la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourings. O! Beg that these may be eminently with me. Poor <hi>England</hi> I think is near heavy strokes, for her barrenness, sensuality, and enmity against the power of Holiness. The Lord grant that this may not come as a snare on you and me, but that we may be sober, and watchful unto Prayer. The gracious Lord who dwelt in the Bush, be with you, to teach, strenghen and warn you, that in his Hand you may be serviceable and glorious. In him I am, and ever shall be.</p>

                     <p>I Should rejoyce to hear how God is dealing with your inward man, and what measures of success you are Crowned with in your labours of the Gospel, and interest of the Son of God in the world. We may justly guess what God will do with us in the Land by his breathings with his Truths. I desire with much earnestness to know (seeing you have so many advantages beyond us in these poor Corners) how the Spirits of Professors stand quallified, so far as a conjecture may be made, by the visible tenure of their carriages. I generally find a general secure, earthly, lasie frame hath seized on those among whom I occasionally fall abroad: I hope better things with you; and that a more engaging relish, and taste of God and Glory, is fallen on their hearts, and a more refined pure Lip, seconded by a more humble, self-denying converses before the world. O! what a blessed <hi>Omen</hi> would this be, that God is upon healing terms of Grace with <hi>England.</hi> I must confess, in the place were I now labor, God is Travelling forth with a measure of the greatness of his might. Some most stubborn and obstinate wretches, attend the means, and our Meetings grow; the Spirit of <hi>Jesus</hi> hath made some to fall under him, and our hopes of greater things are encreasing, if the Lord for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful walkings blast not all.</p>
                     <p>My dear Brother, I need not tell you how sweet it is to be Tabernacling in <hi>Mount Tabor,</hi> by close believing Meditation, to see your Lord and mine, and on those veiws to rejoyce with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory: And by the same also to mourn over unkindness with bitterness, as for an only Son.

                     <p>I See you have taken up a more than ordinary care for me, the ground of which, I suppose, is somewhat of God, your conjecture is upon me: In which I beg the Lord you may not be mistaken. If I should confess the truth to my bosome Brother, my heart is such a confused disordered piece, its principles and ends lying so veiled and hidden from my self, that most frequently I am mine own stranger; I know not who, nor what I am; whether God or self swaies me. Only this stayes me, that were the eye of my heart levelled as directly, and in as much single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at the Glory of God in <hi>Christ,</hi> as I would have it be in my greatest strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to him and my self, I think I should be sincere. This therefore being much my state, I may admire at the touch of Gods finger upon your heart, to turn it to such a worm. I had no sooner the Letter, but I saw much of God by it; and in such Providences (through the Redeemer) I desire to hold some Communion with him. I shall hint at a footstep of the blessed walk of God to me, so far as your lines may require.</p>
                     <p>Seven or eight years since, I found among the Writings of a deceased Friend, two Bonds belonging to a poor Orphan; on the finding of which, I sent word to the Orphan of them, who came to the House where I dwelt, and gave order that one of her Debtors should be sued, for the calling in her mony. Accordingly that Bond was sent to a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and the Debtor sued. But it being out of the way of my imployment to attend such a business, I acquainted the Orphan I should not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that affair, but leave it to a Kinsman of hers to manage it, and accordingly regarding it no farther, he promising all fidelity for the bringing in from the Debtor the mony to the Orphan. In process of time, not having heard of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62667:85"/> business, either from the Orphan, or her Kinsman, and therefore concluding that all things were regularly managed, and in equity between them. As I was alone in my imprisonment, I had a thought that stuck upon me: I must enquire what issue of the Orphans affair in her Kinsmans hand attained: And on an enquiry, sound out that the Orphan was abused and damnified 14 <hi>l.</hi> by this Kinsman, who yet had so saved himself, that no justice could be gained against him. On which I was under many disputes with my self, whether I were not obliged to take care the Orphan might be satisfied. I did propose the Case, but was informed in the <hi>Negative.</hi> However, because I intrusted it in his hand, I could not so clearly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my self, and therefore lately borrowed the Mony and paid it to the Orphan: Resolving, notwithstanding my present condition, rather to be the sufferer my self than that the fatherless Child, by the others injustice, should be injured; and was determined to eye the Lord for away to discharge that mony so borrowed. Within a very little time I had borrowed that 14 <hi>l.</hi> yours came, and within a little season from another, and now you write me of more, which makes up the sum. I have been somewhat moved under the graciousness of God: The Lord make me fruitful in my seasonable improvement of this dispensation. I should be very glad▪ might I see you at <hi>Crediton</hi> in my passing up to the <hi>Assizes.</hi> Many things have I to say which I must silence, till God open a door for a more satisfactory converse. You are minded by us here, and I desire to live on your thoughts, when nearest God.</p>

Since my last lines to you, according to my engagement by <hi>Recognizance,</hi> I had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to spend some time with your friends at <hi>Crediton, Chimly,</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moulton;</hi> and am sorry, where there is an appearance of so encouraging an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, so little stomack, and Spirit is found in adjacent Labourers. It hath been long my thought, that God hath yet a great controversie with the <hi>Nonconforming</hi> (tho the best) part of the Ministry of <hi>England;</hi> among whom, how few are there who naturally care for the state of the poor perishing Country, and what their hands find to do, do it with their might. This, with that Levity of Spirit, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holiness of Lip, Reigning Selfishness, Earthly mindedness, Formality, Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Worship, Security, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> visible upon the professing Body, doth as appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and dangerously threaten <hi>England,</hi> as the more branded Debaucheries. I could heartily wish (had the wise Lord seen it fit) your station had been fixed in your Native Soil, that you might be to the quickning of Bretheren, and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Saints; and also ready at hand to succour those poor Corners which seem to cry as the <hi>Macedonian</hi> in the Vision: <hi>Come</hi> over and <hi>help us.</hi> But you know your proper gift, and I presume, will carefully study, and answer your Calls. I did contract friendship in that Journy with Mr. <hi>S.</hi> whom I find of another Spirit, in whose society my Soul was refreshed. And Mr. <hi>F.</hi> of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> I find a wel-tempered Man, whom else I met to rejoyce in, of my Bretheren, I scarce know any. The times now are very black, and clouds are gathering in every quarter: What the issue of our storms may be, a little time will much indicate. I wish I could say, <hi>Nubecula cito transibit.</hi> To give you my fears, I think this nothing to what must ensue. I have been long waiting for this, and do confidently believe this not the dearest Testimony that must be given to Gospel truths and duties. A National overwhelming Cluster of severe Judgments, I am sore afraid is at the door, sharper than what formally for some scores of years we have felt; tho, I hope, there will be a larger measure of God to sanctifie them for the reforming of his own, and converting the Rebels, then ever we yet experienced. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, is some stay to me, under what I am forced to believe. I have often begged, if the Lord sees I am like to prove a dishonour to his interest, he would first shut me up in the dust.</p>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Mr.</hi> Richard Mather, <hi>who Dyed</hi> Anno Christi, 1669.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>RIchard Mather</hi> was born in a Village called <hi>Lowton,</hi> situate in the Parish of <note place="margin">His Birth and Parentage.</note>
                  <hi>Winwick,</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaster, Anno Christi,</hi> 1596. His Parents <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Margaret Mather,</hi> were of ancient Families in <hi>Lowton</hi> aforesaid; But by reason of some unhappy <hi>Mortgages,</hi> they were reduced into a low condition in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their outward Estate. Nevertheless; God so disposed and inclined their Hearts, that they were willing and careful to train up this their Son in good <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Education.</note> Concerning which he (after the Lord was pleased to bestow not only Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but Grace upon him) hath sometimes expressed himself thus: <hi>By what princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and motives my Parents were chiefly induced to keep me at School, I have not to say, nor do I certainly know: But this I must needs say, that this was the singular good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God towards me (who hath the Hearts of all men in his Hand) thus to incline the Hearts of my Parents. For in this thing the Lord of Heaven shewed me such favour as had not been shewed to many of my Predecessors, and Contemporaries in that place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now his Parents being strongly bent to have this their Son a Schollar, they <note place="margin">Is sent to School.</note> sent him to the School at <hi>Winwick,</hi> which was about four Miles distant from their House. In the Winter Season they boarded him at <hi>Winwick;</hi> but such was his eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire after knowledg and learning, that in the Summer time he went every Day thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on foot. But whilst he was thus at School he met with no small discouragment from his School master, who tho he had an excellent faculty, and ability to teach, <note place="margin">His Masters se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.</note> and train up youth in <hi>Grammer Learning,</hi> and many were trained up by him, whom he sent to the Universities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to make farther progress in higher studies; yet did he much discourage his Schollars by his too great severity, and partiality in his Discipline. Mr. <hi>Junius</hi> was almost discouraged in his studies, when being a School-Boy, his Master would beat him eight times in a Day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guilty or not guilty of any fault: The like magisterial rigour caused young <hi>Mather</hi> earnestly to desire of his Father, that he would take him from School, and dispose of him to some other Calling.</p>
               <p>Yet himself afterwards, when he had waded through these difficulties, would say, That God intended better for him than he would have chosen for himself; and therefore (said he) <hi>my Father (tho in other things he was indulgent enough, yet) in this he would never condescend to my request, but by puting me in hope, that by his speaking to the Master, things would be amended, he would still over-rule me to proceed in my studies. And good it was for me to be over-ruled by him, and his discretion, rather than to be left to my own affections and desires.</hi> But oh that all School-Masters would learn Wisdom, moderation, and equity towards their Schollars, and seek rather to win the Hearts, of Children by righteous, loving, and courteous carriage, and usage, than to discourage and alienate their minds by partiality, and undue severity, which had been my utter undoing, had not the good Providence of God, and the Wisdom, and authority of my Father prevented it. But thus was that of the <hi>Poet</hi> made good.</p>

               <p>After he had spent sundry years in the School some <hi>Popish</hi> Merchants coming
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62667:86"/> out of <hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>Warrington,</hi> which is but two Miles from <hi>Winwick,</hi> made diligent enquiry whether there were not some pregnant Wits in that School whom they might procure for Apprentices? Presently our <hi>Richard Mather</hi> was mentioned to them as a pregnant <note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vidence.</note> Youth; whereupon application was presently made to his Father to know whether he would thus dispose of him? who was found inclinable to accept of the Motion, because now his Estate was so decayed, that he almost desparied of bringing up this his Son as he had intended: But here the Finger of Divine Providence was very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable; for when the Father was thus ready to part with his Son, and the Child to go, the Lord raised up the heart of his Master to be importunate with his Father still to keep him at School, professing that it was great pity that a Wit so prone to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning should be taken from it, (as indeed it was) or that he should be undone by <hi>Popish</hi> Education: And the perswasions of the Master so far prevailed, as that his Scholar was still continued under his care and tuition, until the fifteenth year of his Age.</p>
               <p>It was a singular Providence, and a great Mercy to young <hi>Mather,</hi> for that whilst he was yet in his Minority, he enjoyed the publick Ministery of one Mr. <hi>Palin,</hi> who was then Preacher at <hi>Leagh,</hi> of whom he would say, that the Remembrance of that Man was comfortable and honourable in his thoughts, even in his Old Age, tho his knowledge of him was in his Childhood; for he observed then such a plain, powerful and piercing efficacy in Mr. <hi>Palin</hi>'s Ministry, as was not to be found in the common sort of Preachers in those days, by means whereof some illumination, tho not a through Conversion was wrought in him.</p>

Nor was it a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his worth that he was once a School-Master, for many eminent Divines even of our own Nation have been so; as Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jeremy Whitaker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Vines,</hi> &amp;c. But rather it was his high commendation, and the like seldom known, that one should be found fit to teach and govern a School at fifteen years of Age: And yet the Lord helped him in those his young years to carry it with such Wisdom, Love, and Gravity among his Scholars, as was to admiration; so as that he was by them both loved and feared, beyond what is usual, even where there are more aged Masters.</p>
               <p>This his imployment was more ways than one advantageous to him; for by this <note place="margin">The usefulness of it to him.</note> means he became a more accurate <hi>Grammarian</hi> than <hi>Divines</hi> usually are: And being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious in his Studies whilst he continued in this kind of imployment, he became a good Proficient in other Arts, as in <hi>Logick Rhetorick</hi> and in <hi>Theology:</hi> Moreover it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appeared to be of God, that he was called to such a work in such a place; for there the more effectual Conversion of his Soul unto the Lord was wrought in his tender years, even before his going to the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> whereby he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <note place="margin">His Conversion.</note> from those Vices and Corruptions which undid many of his <hi>Contemporaries,</hi> thro the Temptations which they met with in that place.</p>
               <p>The means of his Conversion was partly by observing a strange difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himself and sundry in that godly Family of Mr. <hi>Edward Aspinwal</hi> (whom I knew when I lived in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> as also Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> himself) This Mr. <hi>Aspinwal</hi> was a Learned and Religious Gentleman; and Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> took notice of the way and walking of that holy Man, which was such as himself had not yet been accustomed unto, which caused sad fears to rise in his Soul, lest haply he might not be in the right way which leads unto eternal Life: Also Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> (whom I knew also) then a famous minister at <hi>Hyton,</hi> preaching upon <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. concerning the necessity of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Mather</hi> at the same time reading a Book published by <hi>William</hi>

                  <hi>Perkins,</hi> shewing how far a Reprobate may go, and yet be damned: God blessed these three things, not only to Conviction, but to his Conversion also; which was <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>14.</p>
               <p>The pangs of the new Birth were very terrible to him, insomuch as many times when others were at their Meals in the Family where he sojourned, he oft absented <note place="margin">His Dejection.</note> himself, to retire under Hedges, and in other secret places, there to lament his misery before God: But after sometime, the Lord revived his broken heart, by sending the Holy Spirit to accompany the Ministry of the Word, and to enable him to apply the precious promises of the Gospel to his Soul. <note place="margin">His comfort.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Being thus become a new Creature, he was more eminently a blessing in that Family, and in that Calling which the Lord had disposed him in, and such notice was taken of him abroad, that even from places remote Children were sent unto him for Instruction and Education; and by Gods blessings upon his labours and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, <note place="margin">His success.</note> many were fitted for and sent to the Universities from his School. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving passed over some years in this imployment, he resolved (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to spend some time in one of the Universities himself; as apprehending that there, by conversing with Learned Men, by performing of <hi>Scholastical</hi> Exercises, and other advantages not elsewhere to be had, he might gain more profit than possibly he could by his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Studies in the Country.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, in prosecution of his resolves, he went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and was admitted into <hi>Brazen-Nose</hi> Colledge; and being settled there, he was variously affected: For <note place="margin">Goes to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  </note> it much rejoyced him to find many there who had been his <hi>Quondam</hi> Scholars. It was also a joy to him, that he had now such leisure to follow his Studies; and by Disputations, Lectures, Conferences with learned Men, helps of Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He found marvellous advantages to obtain a rich Treasure of Knowledge: But his heart before this, being touched with the Fear of God, the superstition and prophaness which he was forced there to behold, was no small grief unto him.</p>
               <p>Soon after his coming to <hi>Oxford,</hi> by a good providence, he came into acquaintance with learned Doctor <hi>Woral,</hi> who was very helpful to him by directing him in the course of his private Studies; and among other things, he advised him to read over the Works of the Learned <hi>Peter Ramus;</hi> which Counsel he followed, and saw no cause to repent of his so doing.</p>
               <p>But having not spent so much time in <hi>Oxford</hi> as he could have wished that he might <note place="margin">Called to <hi>Tox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Park.</hi>
                  </note> have done, the People in <hi>Toxteth,</hi> whose Children had been trained up by him, sent to him, desiring that he would return unto them, to instruct, not so much their Children as themselves, and that not in meer <hi>Humane Literature,</hi> but in the things of God: And this Call, after mature deliberation, he accepted of.</p>
               <p>Being returned to <hi>Toxteth,</hi> he Preached his first Sermon, <hi>November</hi> 30. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1618. There was a very great concourse of People (the Word of God being precious <note place="margin">His first Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> at that time in those Parts) to hear him, and his Labours were highly accepted of by those who were judicious. Such was the vastness of his Memory, as that the things which he had prepared and intended to deliver at that time, contained no less than six long Sermons. <note place="margin">His memory.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The People having now had some taste and tryal of his Gifts, were the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate in their desires to have him continue and fix amongst them; and because that could not be without <hi>Ordination,</hi> they urged him to accept thereof; and he, having not at that time studied that part of <hi>Ceremonious Conformity,</hi> yielded unto the motion, and accordingly, he (together with many others on the same day) was ordained by Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> the then Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> after the mode of those times. <note place="margin">His Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Ordination being ended, the Bishop singled out Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> from among the rest, saying, <hi>I have something to say to you, between you and me alone.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was hereupon afraid, that some informations had been given in against him to the Bishop for his <hi>non-Conformity,</hi> and because of his <hi>Puritanism,</hi> thereby to prejudice him: But it fell out to be far otherwise; for when the Bishop had him alone, he spake <note place="margin">Note.</note> thus unto him: <hi>I have an earnest request unto you, and you must not deny me; it is, that you would pray for me: For I know</hi> (said he) <hi>the Prayers of Men that fear God will avail much; and such an one I believe you to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being thus setled in his Ministry at <hi>Toxteth</hi> (where I was acquainted with him) he resolved to change his single condition, and accordingly he became a Suitor to Mrs. <hi>Katherine Hoult,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Edward Hoult</hi> Esq; of <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> she
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62667:87"/> had (and that deservedly) the repute of a very godly and prudent Maid: But the motion for several years met with obstructions, by reason of her Father's being not affected towards <hi>Non-conformable Puritans</hi> (as in those days they were, by way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, stiled) yet at last he gave his consent that Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> should marry his Daughter, <note place="margin">His Mariage.</note> and the Match was consummated, <hi>September</hi> 29th. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1624. And God made her to become a rich Blessing to him, continuing them together for above the space of thirty years.</p>
               <p>By her, God gave him six Sons; four whereof, namely <hi>Samuel, Timothy, Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and <hi>Joseph,</hi> were born in <hi>Old England;</hi> and two, namely <hi>Eliazar</hi> and <hi>Increase</hi> in <note place="margin">His Children.</note>
                  <hi>New.</hi> After his Marriage, he removed his Habitation three Miles from <hi>Toxteth</hi> to <hi>Much Woolton,</hi> having there purchased a House of his own; yet was he wont con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, both <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> to preach the Word at <hi>Toxteth</hi> every <hi>Lords Day.</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his abode there, he was abundant in his Labours in the Gospel of Christ; for <note place="margin">His labors.</note> every <hi>Lords-Day</hi> he preached twice at <hi>Toxteth;</hi> and once in a Fortnight, on the <hi>Tuesdays,</hi> he kept a Lecture at a Market Town called <hi>Prescot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also faithful and powerful Preaching being then somewhat rare in those Parts, he did frequently preach upon <hi>Holy-days</hi> (as they were called) being often thereunto <note place="margin">His industry.</note> desired by godly Christians of other Parishes in that Country; and this he did, not as thinking that there was any Holiness in those days, or in other days besides the <hi>Lords-Days,</hi> but because there would then be an opportunity of great Assemblies, and he judged it good to cast the Net where there were store of Fish. And probably for this cause it was that the Apostles of Christ preached mostly in populous Towns and Cities; as also upon the <hi>Jewish Sabbaths</hi> in their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> even after their Abrogation as to any Religious tye upon Conscience for their observation. Yea, and besides all this, he preached many Funeral Sermons.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, Mr. <hi>Cartwright, Hildersam,</hi> and some other famous <hi>Non Conformists</hi> have scrupled the preaching of Funeral Sermons: Also in some Reformed Churches, that <note place="margin">About funera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Publicola</hi> made an excellent Oration in praise of <hi>Brutus,</hi> which the People were so taken with, that it became a custom that famous Men dying should be so praised: And when (as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Cirmillus</hi> tells us) the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies had readily and freely parted with their Gold-Chains and Jewels in a time of need for the publick Good; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate made a Decree, that it should be lawful to make Funeral Orations for them also. <hi>Hinc mortuus laudandi mos fluxit, quem nos hodie servanius,</hi> saith <hi>Polydor Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor indeed was this <hi>Rite</hi> practised in the Church afore the <hi>Apostasie</hi> began. See <hi>Magd. Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>Cha.</hi> 6. Wherefore this faithful Servant of the Lords avoided that practice, his Speech at Funerals being directed not to the praise of the Dead, but to the instruction of the Living; as concerning Death, the Resurrection, the Judgment to come, and such like profitable, seasonable and suitable truths. Thus did he preach the Word, <hi>being instant in season, out of season, reproving, rebuking, exhorting with all long suffering and Doctrine.</hi> In his publick Ministry in <hi>Old England</hi> he went over 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> Ch. 24. <hi>Psalm 4th.</hi> and <hi>Psalm</hi> 16. <hi>Proverbs</hi> Ch. 1. and <hi>Isa.</hi> Ch. 1. and Chap. 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 22, and 23 Chapters. <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. 8. the Second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the Second Epistle of St. <hi>John,</hi> and the Epistle of <hi>Jude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had thus spent painfully and faithfully fifteen years in the Work of the Ministry; He that holds the Stars in his right Hand, had more work for him to do elsewhere, and therefore Satans rage must be suffered to break forth to the stopping of his Mouth. The Lecture which he kept at <hi>Prescot</hi> caused him to be much taken notice of, and so he became more, to the Adversaries of the Truth, an Object of Envy: <hi>Magnam Famam, &amp; magnam quietem codem tempore nemo potest acquirere,</hi> saith <hi>Quint.</hi> Where complaints being made against him for his <hi>Non-conformity</hi> to the Ceremonies, he was <hi>suspended</hi> in <hi>August</hi> 1633. under which he continued till <hi>November</hi> following; <note place="margin">Suspended and restored.</note> But then, by means of the intercession of some Gentleman in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and by the influence of one <hi>Simon Biby</hi> (who was neerly related to the Bishop) he was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to the exercises of his publick Ministry.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:62667:88"/>
               <p> But this restored Liberty continued not long: For <hi>Anno Christi.</hi> 1634. Bishop <hi>Neal</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Again suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> (who was sometime by King <hi>James</hi> pleasantly admonished of his Preaching <hi>Popery,</hi> because by his carriage he taught the People to pray for a blessing upon his dead Predecessor) being now become Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> sent his Visitors into the Diocess of <hi>Chester;</hi> who being come into the Country, kept their Court at <hi>Wigan,</hi> where (among others) Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was convented before them, and by them was suspended meerly for his <hi>Non-Conformity?</hi> And it was marvellous to consider how God was with him, causing a Spirit of Courage, and of Glory to rest upon him, and filling him with wisdom, when he stood before his Judges, who were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that he should speak for himself, or to declare the Reasons which convinced his Conscience of the unlawfulness of that Conformity which they required: Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which himself wrote thus: <hi>In the passages of that day, I have this to observe, and to bless the Name of God for, that the terror of their threatning words, of their Pursevants,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Being thus <hi>silenced</hi> from publick Preaching the word, means was again used by Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> Friends to obtain his Liberty. The Visitor asked how long he had been a Minister? Answer was made, that he had been in the Ministry fifteen years. And said the Visitor, <hi>How often hath he worn the Surplice?</hi> Answer was returned, that he had never worn it. What (said the Visitor, with an Oath) <hi>Preach fifteen years, and never were a Surplice? It had been better for him that he had gotten seven Bastards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Case being thus, he betook himself to a private Life: And no hope appearing that he should enjoy his Liberty in the Land of his Nativity; Foreseeing also the <note place="margin">Sapiens Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinat.</note> approaching Calamities of <hi>England,</hi> he meditated a Removal from thence into <hi>New-England.</hi> The principle Arguments whereby he was convinced that he had a Divine Call to engage in so great and hazardous a design, he drew up, and put them into form, which I shall not need to set down.</p>
               <p>Being now fully satisfied concerning the clearness of his Call to <hi>New-England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He resolves for <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> and his People at <hi>Toxteth,</hi> who did so dearly love his Person, and highly prize his Ministry, yet now thought that God called him to leave them; after many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and extraordinary seeking unto God he resolved, and engaged upon the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of himself and family thither.</p>
               <p>His parting with his People and Friends in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> was like Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leave of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> with much sorrow, many tears being shed by those that expected to see his face no more in this World. He began this Journy in <hi>April, Anno Christi.</hi> 1635. And Travelled to <hi>Bristow,</hi> purposing to take Shipping there: In this Journy he was forced (as sometime <hi>Brentius</hi> was) to change his outward Habit, that he might travel <hi>incognito,</hi> because Pursevants were designed to apprehend him; But by this means he came safe, and unmolested unto <hi>Bristow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Bristow</hi> they set sail for <hi>New-England, May</hi> the 23<hi>d. Anno Christi.</hi> 1635 And the Lord after manifold Tryals of their Faith and Patience, brought them in <note place="margin">His Voyage.</note> safety to their desired Haven. 'Tis seldom known, that a man designed in Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Counsel to any special services, doth not at one time or other experience emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Deliverances of Gods Providence: And so it was with this Servant of the Lord not once, nor twice. Sundry eminent Salvations from deadly dangers did the Lord vouchsafe unto him in his Childhood, which he would speak of in his old age: But the most remarkable, and memorable of all others, was that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him on the mighty waters, where he that sits upon the flouds, and stilleth the raging of the Sea, when the waves thereof Rore, and whom the winds obey, shewed himself wonderful in Goodness. For when the Vessel that carried him was <note place="margin">Providence extraordinary.</note> upon the Coast of <hi>New-England,</hi> there arose a dreadful storm (called by the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners a <hi>Hurricane)</hi> by means whereof they were in no small danger: And had not the Lord strangely turned the wind in an instant, they had all perished upon the Rocks which were just before them, and within sight of them that were in the Ship. The Relation of this signal Providence, we will here set down in Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> own words, left written by himself in his <hi>Jornal</hi> from <hi>Lancashire</hi> to <hi>New-England;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he thus writes.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:62667:88"/>
               <p> August <hi>the 15th.</hi> Anno Christi. 1635. <hi>The Lord had not yet done with us, nor had he let us see all his power, and goodness, which he would have us to take notice of: And</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Hurricane.</note>
                  <hi>therefore about break of day, he sent a most terrible storm of Rains and</hi> Easterly <hi>wind, whereby we were in as much danger, as (I think) ever people were. When we came to Land we found many mighty Trees rent in pieces in the midst of their bodies, and others turned up by the Roots by the fierceness of the Tempest. That Morning we lost three Anchors and Cables, one of them having never been in the water before. Two were broken by the strength and violence of the storm, and the third was cut off by the Marriners in extremity of distress, to save the Ship, and their own, and our lives. And when our Cables and Anchors were all lost and gone, we had no outward and visible means of deliverance, but by hoising Sail, if so be we might get to Sea from among the Islands, and Rocks where we had Anchored.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Lord let us see that our Sails could not save us neither, no more than the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Anchors: For by the force of the Wind and storm the Sails were rent assunder, and split in pieces as if they had been but rotten rags, so that of divers of them there was scarce left so much as an hands-breadth that was not torn in pieces or blown away into the Sea; so that at that time all hope that we should be saved, in regard of all outward appearance, was utterly taken away, and the rather because we seemed to drive with full force of wind, directly upon a mighty Rock standing out in sight above water, so that we did but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually wait when we should hear and feel the doleful crashing of the Ship upon the Rock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this extremity, and appearance of death, as distress and distraction would suffer us, we cryed unto the Lord, and he was pleased to have compassion upon us. For, by his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence, and his own immediate good hand, he guided the Ship by, and past the Rock, asswaged the violence of the Sea and of the wind. It was a day much to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, because on that day God granted us as wonderful and as signal a deliverance, as I think ever any People had felt: The Seamen confessed that they never knew the like. The Lord so imprint the memory of it in our hearts, that we may be the better for it, and be careful to please him, and to walk uprightly before him so long as we live: And I hope we shall not forget the Passages of that Morning, until our dying day. In all this grievous storm my fear was the less when I considered the clearness of my Calling from God this way. And in some measure (the Lords Holy Name be blessed for it) he gave us hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and willing that he should do with us, and ours what he pleased, and what might be most for the Glory of his Great Name, and in this we rested our selves: but when News was brought into the Gun-room to us, that the danger was past: Oh how our Hearts did then</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thankfulness.</note>
                  <hi>relent, and melt within us! We burst out into Tears of Joy amongst our selves in Love unto our Gracious God, and admiration of his kindness, in granting unto his poor Servants such an Extraordinary, even and Miraculous a deliverance. His Holy Name be blessed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far is Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> Relation of this signal Providence, as left written with his own hand. And this is the more to be taken notice of, because the lives of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny choice Instruments of Gods Glory were then saved. For not only Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> himself, but two of his Sons, who afterwards were faithful Ministers of the Gospel, were in that Vessel: And so likwise was that worthy Minister of <hi>Christ</hi> (Mr. <hi>Jonathon Mitchel)</hi> the late faithful, and famous Pastor of the Church in <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> he being then a Child of eleven years old. Also this deliverance was the more remarkable, in that several Vessels were cast away in that storm. As</p>
               <p>A Ship called the <hi>Angel Gabriel,</hi> which set out from <hi>Bristow</hi> with the Vessel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was, being then at Anchor at <hi>Pemequid,</hi> was broken in pieces; And the very same strange and sudden turn of the wind, which saved the Ship in which Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was, ruined the other which came from <hi>Old-England</hi> at the same time with him. Also there was then a Ship going between <hi>Pascataqua,</hi> and the <hi>Bay,</hi> which was cast away in this storm, and all the People therein lost, except two who were spared to report the News. And among others in that Vessel which then peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, there was a precious Minister of the Gospel, namely on Mr. <hi>Avery,</hi> who with his Wife, and five Children, all perished. This Minister every moment expecting that the next wave would be a wave of death, lifted up his eyes to Heaven and said, <hi>Lord I cannot Challenge a Promise of the preservation of my life, but according to thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Providence special.</note>
                  <hi>I challenge Heaven.</hi> Which had no sooner spoken, but a wave came immediatly, and swept him away, and so wafted him to Heaven indeed. And by the way, let it be farther noted, that this was the only Vessel which at that time had miscarried with Passengers from <hi>Old-England</hi> to <hi>New:</hi> So signally did the Lord in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence own the Plantation of <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62667:89"/>
               <p> But to digress no farther; this storm being allayed, the Lord brought them safe to an Anchor before <hi>Boston, August 17th. Anno Christi,</hi> 1635. And Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> abode with his Family in <hi>Boston</hi> for some Months; And both he, and his gracious Consort joyned to the Church there.</p>
               <p>Being thus by a mighty hand, and out-stretched arm brought safe into <hi>New-England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He is chosen to <hi>Dorchester.</hi>
                  </note> Motion from sundry Towns were soon presented to him, desiring that he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Talents which the Lord had enriched him with, for the work of the Ministry amongst them. At the same time he was desired at <hi>Plimouth, Dorchester,</hi> and <hi>Roxbury.</hi> But being in a great strait in his own mind which of these invitations to accept of, considering that in difficult Cases Counsel is an Ordinance of God, whereby he is want to discover his Will, he therefore referred himself to the advice of some Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious friends, among whom Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> were the Chief, who accordingly met to consult of this weighty affair. And the result of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was, that he should accept of the Motion from <hi>Dorchester.</hi> Which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being accepted of by him, he did by the help of <hi>Christ,</hi> set upon the gathering of a Church there. The Church which was first planted in that place being removed with the Reverend Mr. <hi>Warham</hi> to <hi>Conecticot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was an essay towards gathering a Church <hi>April 1st. Anno Christi,</hi> 1636. But by reason of the Messengers of some Neighbouring Church, who were not satisfied concerning some that were intended for Members thereof, the work was deferred till <hi>August</hi> the 23<hi>d.</hi> when a Church was constituted in <hi>Dorchester,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was chosen <hi>Teacher</hi> of that Church.</p>
               <p>Being thus again setled in the Lords work, he therein continued to his dying day; the Lord making him an eminent blessing, not only unto <hi>Dorchester,</hi> but to all the Churches, and Plantations round about him, for the space of almost four and thirty years. Its a true observation which many from <hi>Luther</hi> have taken up, to wit, that three things make an able Divine; which are</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Meditatio,</hi> Study. Such an one must give himself to <hi>Reading and Meditation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What makes an able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note>
                  <hi>Secondly, Oratio,</hi> Prayer. A Man of God must be a Man of Prayer; ever anon upon his knees before God, and <hi>Bene orasse est bene studuisse:</hi> He that Prays well, studies well: Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> studied kneeling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Tentatio,</hi> Temptation. As when our Lord <hi>Christ</hi> was to enter upon his Publick Ministry, he was grievously tempted by Satan: So it is wont to be with his Servants, and so it was with this good Man. The Lord having great services for him to do, he must undergo great Temptations, that he might be the better fitted for that work whereunto he was called.</p>
               <p>Wherefore before, and for some years after his accepting the Office of a <hi>Pastor</hi> in <hi>Dorchester,</hi> he was in much Spiritual distress, by reason of uncertainty co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cerning his <note place="margin">His Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> own Spiritual Estate. He did (as in Wisdom he was bound to do) keep these troubles secret from Men, only he revealed the distress of his Soul to that Great Divine Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> then Teacher to the Church in <hi>Ipswich,</hi> unto whom (under <note place="margin">And Comfort.</note>
                  <hi>Christ)</hi> God gave the <hi>Tongue of the Learned to speak a word in season,</hi> whereby his Soul was comforted. The Lord giving him to see that he was walking towards Heaven in the same way that <hi>David, Asaph, Heman,</hi> and many other Worthies had gone before him.</p>
               <p>During the time of his Pilgrimage in <hi>New-England</hi> he underwent not so many Changes, as before he had done. For he never removed his Habitation out of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> albeit that he had once some serious thoughts that way. When Prelacy was voted down by our <hi>English</hi> Parliament, some of his old People at <hi>Toxteth,</hi> sent to him, desiring him to return to them. But <hi>Dorchester</hi> was in no wise willing to forego their interest in him; And therefore he left them not. Nevertheless in <hi>New-England</hi> (as in a Wilderness might be expected) he had experience of many Tryals of his Faith and patience. That which of all outward afflictions did most grieve him, <note place="margin">His Wife dies.</note> was the death of his dear Wife, who had been for so many years the greatest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Comfort and Blessing which he did enjoy. Which affliction was the more grievous unto him, in that, She being a Woman of singular Prudence for the Manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">A good Wife.</note> of his affairs, had taken off from her Husband all secular Cares, so that he had leisure and opportunity wholly to devote himself to his Studies, and Sacred employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>After he had continued in the State of Widdowhood for the space of an year and <note place="margin">His second Marriage.</note>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:62667:89"/> a half, he again changed his condition, and was married to that pious Widdow, the <hi>Relict</hi> of that deservedly famous Man of God, Mr. <hi>John Cotton;</hi> and her did God make a blessing and comfort to him all the remainder of his days.</p>
               <p>Old-Age being now come upon him, he was sensible of the infirmities thereof, being in these his latter years somewhat thick of hearing: Also (as it was with great <hi>Zanchy)</hi> the sight of one of his eyes failed seven years before his death; yet God gave <note place="margin">His healthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> him much health of Body, and vigor of Spirit in a wonderful measure, so as that in fifty years together he was not by sickness detained so much as one <hi>Lords-day</hi> from his publick labors; which continued health (as to natural causes) proceeded partly from the sound and strong constitution of his Body, and partly from his accustoming himself to a plain, wholesome, and temperate Diet: And <hi>Bona Diaeta est potior quovis</hi> Hippocrate: A good Diet is the best Doctor. He never made use of any <hi>Physitian,</hi> nor was he in his whole life ever sick of any acute disease; only the two last years of his life, he was sorely afflicted with that disease which some justly call <hi>Flagellum Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diosorum,</hi> the Scourge of Students; namely, the Stone, which at last brought him to an end of all his labors and sorrows.</p>
               <p>Concerning the time and manner of his sickness and death; thus it was, there <note place="margin">His sickness.</note> being some difference sprung up in <hi>Boston,</hi> Counsel from Neighbour Churches was by some desired, to direct them in the Lord what should be done; and accordingly the Churches sent their Messengers; and <hi>Dorchester</hi> Church, amongst others, sent Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> their aged Teacher, who (with the rest) assembled in <hi>Boston, April</hi> the 13th <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1669. And Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> by reason of his Age, Gravity, Grace and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wherewith the Lord had endowed and adorned him, was chosen <hi>Moderator</hi> in that Reverend Assembly.</p>
               <p>For divers days after his being thus in Consultation, he enjoyed his Health as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, or rather better than for some time of late: But as <hi>Luther,</hi> when with others he was assembled in a <hi>Synod,</hi> was surprized with a violent fit of the Stone, whereupon he was forced to return home, his Friends having little hope of his life; So it was with this holy Man: For <hi>April</hi> the <hi>16th. Anno Christi,</hi> 1669. He was in the Night, being then in his Sons house in <hi>Boston,</hi> taken exceeding ill with a total stoppage of his Urine: the next Morning therefore he returned home to <hi>Dorchester:</hi> And truly great was the favour of God towards him, that he should be found about such a blessed business as he was then engaged in; for the Lord found him sincerely and earnestly endeavouring to be a <hi>Peace-maker.</hi> His being thus taken when at a <hi>Synod,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</note> brings to mind that of the <hi>German Phoenix [Philip Melancthon.]</hi>

               <p>Now, as usually Providence ordereth, that they who have been speaking all their Lives long, shall not say much when they come to dye: Blessed Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker</hi> in his last sickness, when Friends would have been answered to some enquiries which might have made for their Edification after he was gone; he referred them wholly to the things which he had taught them in his health, because (as he said) he had then enough to do to graple with his bodily weakness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither did this good man speak much in his last sickness, either to Friends that visited him, or to his own Children; only his own Son, who is now Teacher of a Church in <hi>Boston,</hi> coming to visit his Father, and perceiving the <hi>Symptoms</hi> of Death to be upon him, said unto him, Sir, if there be any special thing which you would recomend unto me to do, in case the Lord shall spare me upon Earth after you are in Heaven, I would intreat you express it: At which, his Father making a little pause, and lifting up his Eyes and Hands towards Heaven, replyed, <hi>A special thing which I would commend to you, is, Care concerning the rising Generation in this Country, that they be brought under the Government of Christ in his Church; and that when they are grown up and quallified, they have</hi> Baptism <hi>for their Children. I must confess I have been defective as to practice; yet</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Advice to his Son.</note>
                  <hi>I have publickly declared my Judgment, and manifested my desires to practice that which I think ought to be attended, but the dissenting of some in our Church discouraged me: I have thought that persons might have right to</hi> Baptism, <hi>and yet not to the</hi> Lords Supper; <hi>and I see no cause to alter my judgment as to that perticular: And I still think that persons</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:62667:90"/>
                  <hi>qualified according to the fifth</hi> Proposition <hi>of the late</hi> Synod Book, <hi>have right to</hi> Baptism <hi>for their Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His bodily pains continued upon him until <hi>April</hi> the 22<hi>d.</hi> when in the morning his Son aforementioned, coming to visit him, asked his Father if he knew him? To whom he replied, <hi>that he did,</hi> but was not able to speak any more to him: Whereupon his Son saying, now you will speedily be in the joy of your Lord: His Father lifted up his hands, but could not speak: Not long after, his Son again spoke to him, saying, you will quickly see <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and that will make a mends for all your pains and sorrows: At which words, his Father again lift up his hands; but after that he took no notice of any person or thing, but continuing speechless until about ten a clock that night, he quietly brethed forth his last. Thus did that Light <note place="margin">His death.</note> that had been shining in the Church above fifty years, expire, <hi>April</hi> the 22<hi>d. Anno Christi,</hi> 1669. And of his Age Seventy three.</p>
               <p>As some of the Lords <hi>precious Ones</hi> have had a real apprehension, and fore-sight of their approaching dissolution imprinted upon their Spirits; So its noted of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> and of <hi>Gorgonia</hi> of Old; and of <hi>Gesner, Morney, Melancthon,</hi> &amp;c. among Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <note place="margin">Death fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen.</note> Divines and Christians: Thus it was with this holy Man sometime before his Departure. The last Text which he preached upon, was that, The second Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good Fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the Faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge will give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</hi> And the Portion of Scripture, which before he had insisted upon, was <hi>Job</hi> 14. 14. <hi>All the days of mine appointed time will I wait till my Change come.</hi> And the Lord found this his blessed Servant so doing.</p>
               <p>Also the last <hi>Conference-Meeting</hi> which he was at in <hi>Dorchester,</hi> he had prepared to speak something upon those words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>For we know that if the Earthly House of this Tabernacle were Dissolved, we have a Building of God, an House, not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens,</hi> But his bodily pains prevented him from speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was in his Heart to have delivered; The Lord intending that he should no more speak of, but see that place which he had so much, and so oft thought on, and long prayed for, and which he longed to enjoy.</p>
               <p>He was, especially in his last Sickness, a Patern of patience. For altho ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity <note place="margin">Death desired.</note> of pain, without any acute disease, was that which brought him to his Grave, yet did he never so much as once cry out from first to last; And it was very rare to hear him so much as groan (but never to grumble) under his <note place="margin">His patience.</note> dolorous griefs. In his Sickness whereof he Dyed, he was much delighted in reading <hi>Dr Goodwins</hi> Discourse about patience; in which Book he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad till the very Day of his Death.</p>
               <p>Once in his Sickness, his Son saying to him; That in as much as several small Stones were come from him in his Urine, now possibly he might have some ease: His Father answered, with an affecting kind of earnestness: <hi>As for that matter, the will of the Lord be done;</hi> Such was his Grace and patience. And at the same time his Son saying to him; God hath shewed his great faithfullness unto you, having upheld you now for above the space of fifty years in his service; and hath implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you therein without ceasing, which can be said of very few Men upon the face of the whole Earth: His Father replyed, <hi>You say true; I must acknowledge the Mercy of God hath been great towards me all my days; But I must also acknowledge that I have had many failings, and the thoughts of them abaseth me, and worketh patience in me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His humility.</note> When any one asked him, how he did? his usual Answer was, <hi>Far from well, yet far better than mine iniquities deserve.</hi> Thus did he (like Old <hi>Augustine,</hi> who dyed reading the <hi>Penitential Psalms)</hi> keep up a Spirit of Repentance to the last.</p>
               <p>As he was a Man faithful, and fearing God above many, so the Lord shewed great faithfulness unto him, both in making him serviceable unto the very last; yea, and continuing the vigor of his Spirits, and power of his Ministry until his end. Few Men tho young, are known to preach with such vigor as he did but ten days before his death. The Lord also was faithful and gracious to him in respect of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>It was a special token of Divine Favour to some of the Ancients, that their Sons after them succeeded in the Ministry: So it was with the Fathers of <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:62667:90"/>
                  <hi>Gregory Nysen, Basil, Hilary,</hi> &amp;c. And the Lord cheered the heart of this his Servant in his Old Age, by giving him to see most of his Sons imployed in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry many years before the decease of their dear and precious Father: He left four Sons in the Work; One of them, to wit, Mr. <hi>Eliazer Mather,</hi> late Pastor of the <note place="margin">His Children.</note> Church of <hi>Northampton</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> went to his <hi>Rest</hi> about three Months after his Fathers Death, with him to sound forth the Praises of God among the <hi>Spirits of just Men made perfect.</hi> The other three surviving were Mr. <hi>Samuel Mather,</hi> Teacher of a Church in <hi>Dublin:</hi> Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Mather,</hi> Minister of <hi>Barnstable</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>Rotterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> and <hi>Increase Mather</hi> of <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Mather</hi>'s way of preaching was plain, aiming to shoot his Arrows not over his Peoples Heads, but into their Hearts and Consciences; whence he studiously <note place="margin">His manner of Preaching.</note> avoided obscure <hi>Phrases, Exotick</hi> words, and unnecessary citation of <hi>Latin</hi> Sentences, which some men too much adict themselves unto. Holy Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> was wont to say, <hi>that so much</hi> Latin <hi>was so much flesh in a Sermon:</hi> So did this humble Man look upon the affectation of such things in a <hi>Popular Auditory</hi> to savour of Carnal Wisdom. And the Lord gave him an excellent faculty to mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Abstruce</hi> things plain, that in handling the deepest Misteries he would accommodate himself to <hi>Vulgar</hi> Capacities, so that even the meanest might learn something. He knew how to express, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He would often use that saying, <hi>Artis est celare artem:</hi> 'Tis a great piece of Art to conceal Art. And he much approved that of Saint <hi>Austin.</hi> If (said he) <hi>I Preach Learnedly, then only the Learned, and not the unlearned can understand and profit by me: But if I Preach plainly, then Learned, and unlearned both can understand, and so I may profit all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was mighty in the Scriptures; whence Holy Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> would say of him, <note place="margin">Mighty in the Scriptures.</note>
                  <hi>My Brother</hi> Mather <hi>is a Mighty Man.</hi> Also his usual way of delivery, was very powerful, awakning, and zealous; especially in his younger years, there being indeed few Men of so strong a Body as he, which, together with the Natural fervour of his Spirit, being sanctified, made his Ministry the more powerful: And the Lord blessed his Labours to the Conversion of many, both in <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho his way of Preaching was plain and zealous, yet was it substantial, and very Judicious, even in his younger dayes, Mr. <hi>Gillibrand</hi> (A famous Minister of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> in <hi>Lancashire:</hi> And the more famous, for that, tho he did much stammer in his ordinary Discourse, yet would he pray and Preach very fluently) having once heard him Preach, asked what his Name was? And answer being made that his Name was <hi>Mather:</hi> Nay (said Mr. <hi>Gillibrand)</hi> call him <hi>Matter;</hi> For believe it, this Man hath substance in him. Yea, such was the sollidity of his Judgment, that some who were his opposites, did yet therefore respect, and honour him. Dr. <hi>Par</hi> (who was then Bishop in the <hi>Isle of Man)</hi> having heard that Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was silenced, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented it, saying; If Mather <hi>be silenced I am sorry for it; for he is a solid Man, and the Church of</hi> Christ <hi>hath a great loss of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was very diligent as to the duties both of his General, and perticular Calling, <note place="margin">His diligence.</note> which indeed are the two Pillars upon which Religion doth stand. As to his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Calling: He was much in Prayer, especially in his study, where he oft-times <note place="margin">Prayer fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</note> spent whole days with God, in suing for a blessing upon himself, and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and upon the People to whom he was related, and upon the whole Country where he lived. The requests which upon such occasions he put up to God in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and also how his heart was moved to believe that God heard him, he left (many of them) in writing among his private papers; probably that so himself might have recourse to those experiences in the times of <hi>Darkness,</hi> and <hi>Temptations:</hi> As also that his Sons after him might see by their Fathers example, what it is to walk before God. It must needs therefore be a great loss to the world, when such Righteous Men are taken away. Well might <hi>Philo, Jerome, George</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhalt, &amp;c.</hi> Weep bitterly when they heard of the death of any such men; because it portends evil to the places where they have lived, and served God. As he was much in Prayer, so he was frequent in hearing the word. For his manner was to frequent several Lectures in Neighbouring Congregations, untill his disease made him unable to Ride: Yea, and usually even to his old age (as it is Recorded of Mr. <hi>Hildersam)</hi> he took Notes from those whom he heard, professing that he found profit therein.</p>
               <p>As to his perticular Calling, he was ever from his Youth a hard Student. Yea, <note place="margin">Studious.</note>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:62667:91"/> his mind was so intent upon his Work and Studies, that in the very Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed, he importuned those Friends that watched with him to help him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Study. And they urging that he was not able to go so far, he desired them to help him that he might try, which they did: But e're he was come to the Door of his Lodging-Room; <hi>I see</hi> (saith he) <hi>I am not able; Yet I have not been in my Study several dayes, and is it not a lamentable thing that I should lose so much time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After his entrance upon his Ministry, he was not only in <hi>Old England</hi> (as hath <note place="margin">His Industry.</note> been said) but also in <hi>New-England</hi> abundant in Labours. For (except when he had an Assistant, which was seldom) he Preached twice every <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> and a Lecture once in a fortnight, besides many occasional Sermons, both in publick, and in private. Also he was much exercised in answering many <hi>Practical Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> and in <hi>Polemical,</hi> especially <hi>Disciplinary Discourses.</hi> In his publick Ministry in <hi>Dorchester,</hi> he went over the book of <hi>Genesis</hi> to Chapter 38. As also <hi>Psalm</hi> the <hi>16th.</hi> The whole Prophesie of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel to Chapter the <hi>15th.</hi> 1 Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> Chapter the <hi>5th.</hi> And the whole second Epistle of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet notwithstanding those rare gifts and graces wherewith the Lord had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned <note place="margin">His great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> him, he was exceeding low and little in his own eyes. Some have thought that his greatest errour was, that he did not magnifie his office as he might, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times should have done. If a Man musterr, tis good erring on that hand. <hi>Humble enough and good enough</hi> was the frequent saying of a great Divine. And Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> used to say, <hi>that every Man hath just so much, and no more of true worth in him, as he hath of Humility.</hi> Saint <hi>Austin</hi> being asked which was the most Excellent Grace? Answered <hi>Humility:</hi> And which was the next? Answered, <hi>Humility:</hi> And which was the third? Replyed again, <hi>Humility.</hi> For this indeed is comprehensively <hi>All,</hi> being of great price in the sight of God: And if so, Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was a Man of much real worth.</p>
               <p>It hath been the manner of some, in writing Lives to insert the <hi>Wills</hi> of those whose Lives and deaths they have published. The last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament</hi> of him whose Life and Death is here related, breathing forth a most Humble, Holy, and Gracious Spirit, we shall here subjoyn the Preface and Conclusion of it. It was written with his own hand, <hi>October 16th.</hi> 1661. Thus</p>
               <p>I <hi>Richard Mather,</hi> Considering the certainty of Death, and the uncertainty of the <note place="margin">His Last Will.</note> time thereof: And withal, knowing it to be the Will of God, that a Man should set his House in order before he departed this Life, do make this my Last <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Testament</hi> in manner following. First of all I acknowledge the rich and wonderful Grace and Mercy of Almighty God, whose <hi>Hands have made and fashioned me,</hi> and who <hi>took me out of my Mothers Womb,</hi> and hath made me a Man, who might have made me a Beast, or other Creature. He hath also by his good Providence preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Being and Comfort of my Life all the dayes of my <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> until now, even for the space of sixty five years: During all which time he hath not suffered me to want either Food or Raiment, or the service of any Creature, which hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for my Comfortable subsisting in this world, which I acknowledge to be the bounteous gift of him who is Lord of all Creatures, and the high Possesser of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth.</p>
               <p>Next of all, and more especially, <hi>I</hi> am bound to give thanks, and praise to him whilst that <hi>I</hi> have any Being, that <hi>I</hi> being a <hi>Child of Wrath by Nature as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and being born in a place of much Profaneness, and <hi>Popery,</hi> he hath of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Grace vouchsafed to draw me out of that woful estate of Sin and Ignorance wherein I lay, and to make himself and his <hi>Christ</hi> known unto me by the Gospel, of which Grace I was most unworthy; and in his great patience and Mercy to bear with my manifold and great Offences, both before and since the time of his gracious Calling of me, tho for my unworthy walking in many perticulars, I might justly have been for ever rejected of him. Yea, and such hath been his rich Grace, that he hath vouchsafed to put me an unworthy Creature into the Ministry of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of his Son, that I should not only know and profess the same, (which yet is an unspeakable mercy) but be also a Preacher of it unto others. In which imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if any thing hath been done, which hath been pleasing to him, or any way beneficial to any Child of his, it hath not been I that have done the same, but the <hi>Grace of God which was with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62667:91"/>
               <p> For I must needs acknowledge, to the praise of his patience and Grace, that in my poor Ministration, for the space of these forty and two years and upwards, I have been much defective in Wisdom and watchfulness over the Peoples Souls, in purity, in faithfulness, in uprightness, in meekness, humility, and zeal: And because of these, and many other my defects, and offences against the Lord, I stand in much need this day of Mercy, and forgiveness through his <hi>Christ,</hi> and have no cause to look for any acceptance, either in this, or in another world, for any Righteousness of mine own, either as touching my Ministry or otherwise, but disclaiming all thoughts in that kind, mine only trust and hope is to be accepted of him, and (when this Life shall be ended) to be saved in his Heavenly Kingdom, meerly by his <hi>free Grace,</hi> and the Obedience, and precious passion and intercession of his dear Son.</p>
               <p>And as concerning Death, as I do believe that <hi>it is appointed for all Men once to die:</hi> So, because I see a great deal of unprofitableness in mine own Life; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord hath let me see such vanity, and cmptiness even in the best of those Comforts which this Life can afford, that I think I may truly say, <hi>that I have seen an end of all perfection:</hi> Therefore if it were the Will of God, I should be glad to be removed hence, where the best that is to be had doth yield such little satisfaction to my Soul, and to be brought into his presence in Glory, that there I might find (for there I know it is to be had) that satisfying, and <hi>Al-sufficient</hi> contentment in him, which under the Sun, is not to be enjoyed. In the mean time I desire to stay the Lords leisure. <hi>But thou O Lord, how long!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning mine outward Estate, sith <hi>the Earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof, the Habitable World, and all that is therein;</hi> to him therefore belongs the praise of all that I possess in this kind: And for the Portion thereof which he hath given me, it is my mind and <hi>Will</hi> (if so be, it please his Highness) that after my Decease, the same may be disposed of as followeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus graciously expressed himself, he proceeded to the disposal of his Temporal Estate, which being of private Concernment, we shall not here trouble the world therewith. But, after the disposal of that, he concluded with a most solemn charge to his Children, with the Rehearsal whereof we shall finish this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. It is this</p>
               <p>Concerning my Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> with all the rest of my Beloved Sons, as I hope, God hath already made them pertakers, at least sundry of them, of his saving Grace in <hi>Christ,</hi> for which they, and I have cause endlesly to be thankful; so I think it not amiss, for the furtherance of their Spiritual good, to lay upon them this serious and solemn charge of a Dying Father, that none of them presume after my Decease, to walk in any way of sin and wickedness in one kind, or another, or in a careless neglect of God, and the things of God, and of their own Salvation by <hi>Christ.</hi> For if they shall so do (which God forbid) then, and in such a Case, I do hereby testifie unto them, that their Father which begat them, and their Mother which did bear them, with all the Prayers which they have made, and Tears which they have shed for them; their Example, their admonitions, and Exhortations which they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred unto them, together with this my last <hi>Will,</hi> and solemn Charge; All these will rise up against them as so many <hi>Testimonies</hi> for their Condemnation at the last Day. But I have better hopes of them: And do hereby declare unto them, that if they shall seriously repent of their sins, believe in the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and by his Grace, walk in all the wayes of God, and as becometh the Gospel of <hi>Christ,</hi> as this will be to the Honour, and Glory of him that made them, so it will redound to their own unspeakable Comfort, and benefit in this, and in another World: And their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that now speaketh unto them, with their Dear Mother, now with God, shall exceedingly rejoyce in the day of <hi>Christ,</hi> when we shall receive our Children unto those everlasting Habitations: And shall see, not our selves alone, but those also who have proceeded, and come forth out of our own Bowels to have their part and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that Eternal Glory. In desire and hope that it may be so, I Commend them all to the Lord of Heavens blessing: And let the Blessing of God in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> be poured out, and remain upon them all for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Mr.</hi> Joseph Allein, <hi>who Died</hi> Anno Christi, 1669.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>JOseph Allein</hi> was born in the <hi>Devizes,</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire, Anno Christi</hi> 1633. In his <note place="margin">His Birth.</note> Childhood he shewed forth a singular sweetness of disposition, and a remarkable diligence in every thing he was imployed about. When he was about eleven years old he was noted to be very constant in private Prayer, and so serious and intent in it, that he would not be diverted, or taken off by the coming of any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally <note place="margin">His early seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God.</note> into the places of his retirement. This and other fruits of a serious and gracious Spirit were the concurrent observation of those in the Family. From this time the whole course of his youth was an even-spun Thred of agedly conversation, which was rendred more amiable by his sweet an pleasant deportment towards all with whom he conversed.</p>
               <p>About this time, his Brother, (Mr: <hi>Edward Allein)</hi> a worthy Minister of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, dyed. whereupon our <hi>Joseph</hi> earnestly desired that he might be trained up to succeed him in the Work of the Ministery; which request was readily hearkned unto by his Father, who accordingly set him to School; and such was his diligence and industry there, that the time alotted to recreation was by him spent at his Book; <note place="margin">His diligence and industry.</note> insomuch as in the space of about four years, he attained to such a measure of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Learning in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, that he was judged by his Master to be fit for the University: After which, he abode for some time with his Father; and a worthy Minister of the Place read <hi>Logick</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>When he was about sixteen years old he went to the University, and was placed in <hi>Lincoln</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he had not been long, before a <hi>Wiltshire</hi> Place <note place="margin">He goes to the University.</note> becoming void in <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge, he was chosen Scholar of that house, his own merits and worth, not any sinister, or indirect means bringing him in.</p>
               <p>Being thus setled there, he gave early and excellent proofs of his indefatigable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and industry in his Studies, accounting it his great happiness that he had <note place="margin">His industry.</note> gained this opportunity of improving his Learning: And truly he spared no labour day nor night; he thought all time too little, no pains too great which he imployed for that end; by his good will he would do nothing else but pray and study: If Friends came to visit him in studying times, (tho at other times he was very civil and sociable in his converse with them) tho they were sure to find him within, yet not sure that he would let them in. He could seldom be found in Bed after four a Clock in the Morning, no, tho sometimes he went not to Bed till about One; and when he had opportunities of procuring sleeping days for others, yet would he not indulge one to himself.</p>
               <p>So covetous was he of time, that as he could scarce spare any for sleep, so neither for food: It was common with him to give away his <hi>Commons,</hi> at least once a day, <note place="margin">Time precious.</note> that he might gain the more time to his Study. When he had left the University and was married, an intimate Friend of his (who had thoughts of changing his condition) wrote to him for an account of the inconveniences of Marriage; to whom he merrily returned this Answer, <hi>Thou would'st know the inconveniences of a Wife, and I will tell thee some of them; Whereas now thou risest constantly about four a Clock in the Morning, a Wife will keep thee till about six; whereas thou usest to study about fourteen hours in a Day, she will bring thee to eight or nine; and whereas thou art wont to forbear one Meal a Day at least for thy Studies, she will bring thee to thy Meat; and if these be not mischiefs enow to affright thee from Marriage, I know not what will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this his diligence and sedulity in his studies, he came on (through Gods blessing) exceedingly in Learning, so that his profiting appeared unto all men. He would <note place="margin">His proficiency.</note> often say, that he cheifly affected <hi>Rational</hi> Learning, valuing Skill in the <hi>Languages</hi> only for the sake of Things, and those things most, which were of all most likely to improve his Judgment; and the truth of his words was sufficiently evident; for all that were acquainted with him knew him to be, as a good <hi>Linguist,</hi> so an acute
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62667:92"/>
                  <hi>Disputant,</hi> and an excellent <hi>Philosopher:</hi> When he performed any <hi>Academical</hi> Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, either in the Hall or in the Schools, he always came off with <hi>Applause,</hi> or at least with the Approbation of all but the Envious, who yet had nothing to say against him.</p>
               <p>His pregnant Parts and early Accomplishments where so taken notice of, that no sooner was he a Batcheller of Arts, but he was even compell'd to become a <hi>Tutor,</hi> and presently was intrusted with as great a number of <hi>Pupils</hi> as any in the House: Some of his Scholars were <hi>Graduates</hi> in Divinity, and singular Ornaments to that Society, and profitable Instruments in the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> During his abode there, a <hi>Chaplain's</hi> Place falling void, he chose that before a <hi>Fellowship,</hi> which, he knew, in a little time would fall unto him of Course; and this choice he never repented of; yea, he oft reflected upon it with a great deal of content and comfort; For he had always a very ardent affection for Prayer, insomuch as he and his Friend could hardly meet, but before they parted, at his request they must also pray together: What a pleasure than was it to him, twice a day to engage a whole Society in so dear and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <note place="margin">His love of Prayer.</note> an Exercise: And well was it for the Colledge that he so esteemed it: Scarce was it possible that any could have performed that Office better than he did; He did not trouble them with a great deal of noise, vain <hi>Tautologies,</hi> crude Effusions, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible sense, or mysterious nonsense instead of Prayer: His Spirit was serious, his Gesture reverent, his Words few, but premeditated and well weighed, pithy, solid, and fully expressive of his truly humble and earnest desires: He hated the sauciness, which some call <hi>holy bouldness,</hi> and drew near to God, not as if he had been going to play with his Mate, but as became a Creature over-awed with the Majesty of his <note place="margin">His manner of praying.</note> great Creator: He prayed with the Spirit, and with the Understanding also: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Sin with real grief, inward hatred and detestation of it: He craved mercies like one that felt the want and worth of what he begged, with faith, fervency and humble importunity; his affections working, but working rationally as well as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>And this (as doubtlesly it prevailed above) so on the Hearers it had the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful insluence, because they found it to be no meer Religious fit but exactly agreeable to <note place="margin">His Devotion.</note> the habitual frame and disposition of the Speaker. There are too many, who whilst praying and preaching appear very demure, and mighty devout; but take them out of the Pulpit, and they are as light, vain and frothy as any others; But it was far otherwise with Mr. <hi>Allein;</hi> he was always composed, serious and grave, above his Age; he set God always before him, and where ever he was, he still laboured to walk as in his presence: It was his care to make Religion his business, and his great endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to walk by Rule: His main design in all his ways, was to approve himself to his Heavenly Father which saw all in secret; and his Exercise was, <hi>to keep a Conscience void of offence, both towards God and towards Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the pleasures and delights of Sin, he utterly abhorred them: yea, was so much <note place="margin">Sin abhorred.</note> above them, that he could not endure them. How sweet was it to him (as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> said) <hi>istis suavitatibus carere,</hi> To want those sweets? And as for lawful delights and pleasures, tho somtimes he entertained himself with them, yet was his Heart little taken with them. His conversation being in Heaven his sweetest Comforts, and most Divine refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were holy and heavenly: His Soul took many a delightful prospect of Eternity, and hugged herself in a comfortable perswasion, that ere long she should enjoy those glorious <hi>Mansions;</hi> and this made him little to mind earthly Glory, or the poor emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty delights of Sense.</p>
               <p>He was of a very sweet disposition, and of as highly civil a Conversation, as a <note place="margin">His Assability.</note> Man subject to the common frailties of humane Nature could be: He had scarce a Gesture which did not seem to speak, and by a powerful and charming <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> affect all whom he conversed with: Besides other moral perfections that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with, it might be truly said (as the <hi>Historian</hi> said of the Emperor for his Clemency) that he was <hi>Totus ex Commitate,</hi> made up, as it were, of nothing else but courtesie and affability.</p>
               <p>He was a true and faithful Friend to those who had interest in him, and withal, as pleasant as a serious Christian could well wish: He was not rash in choosing, but <note place="margin">A true Friend</note> having chosen he loved intirely. There was no more but one only thing which he thought too much for any, for whom he thought not his Love too good; He could not sin (knowingly and willingly) for any Friend he had on Earth: He was a Friend
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62667:93"/>
                  <hi>Ʋsque ad aris;</hi> So far as lawfully, and Conscientiously he might do any thing, he stuck at nothing, wherein he might serve or gratifie those whom he loved.</p>
               <p>Yet whilst to his Friends he shewed himself Friendly, good Nature as well as <note place="margin">His Charity.</note> Christianity, obliged him to be kind to all, and (according to his ability) to the poor, bountiful. He was too frugal to misplace his Charity, yet not so Covetous as to withold it when he met with fit objects. He did not think the little he had so much his own, as that his necessitous Brethren might not claim a part in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave to them as if he had been paying a debt, and not bestowing an Almes. But above all, his Love and Affection to the Souls of others was most admirable, <note place="margin">Charity to Souls.</note> to whom he desired and endeavoured to do all the good possible, insomuch as some there were, and are, who do verily think that they should never have found the way to Eternal Life, if he had lived to himself, and not for the good of others. His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the poor Prisoners in <hi>Oxford</hi> Gaol was very eminent, amongst whom (as Holy Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> did at <hi>Cambridge)</hi> of his own accord, he began to Preach, and held on constantly (whilst he remained in the Town) once a fortnight, for above the space of twelve Months; encouraging them to give attendance upon his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, by a considerable allowance of Bread, (that week he Preached) at his own cost and charges. He used also at other times, frequently to visit others, who in the world were but mean and low: His main design (together with the Relieving of their Temporal wants) being to assist their Souls in the way to Heaven. Indeed in all his converses, where ever he came, he was like fire, warming, refreshing, and <note place="margin">His Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicativeness.</note> quickening all that were about him; kindling in them the like zeal for God and goodness, which he had in himself: None there were that came to visit, or to be acquainted with him, but (if the fault were not in themselves,) they might get much good by him; yea, so much as to be for ever the better for him. It was hardly possible to be in his Company, and not to hear such things from him, as (if well weighed) might have been enough to make one out of conceit with sin, and in love with virtue so long as one lived. He thought that day wholly lost wherein none had got some good by him. He lived as if he had been quickened with that saying of <hi>Tertullian, Quid prodest esse, quod esse non prodest?</hi> To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is it to Live, and not to live to some good purpose? His ardent Love to Souls hastened his remove into the Country, where he might have opportunities of doing much good.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Allen,</hi> a near Relation of his, gives this Character of him.</p>
               <p>As a Man (saith he) he was of quick natural parts, and of great acquired abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <note place="margin">His Character.</note> Of a grave, composed, and serious temper and behaviour: Not <hi>Morose,</hi> but full of <hi>Candour,</hi> Free, Affable, Chearful, and Courteous.</p>
               <p>As a Christian, he was in Holiness, Heavenly-mindedness, and Exemplariness of Life, much clevated above the ordinary sort of Christians. He had much delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Communion with God, his Soul was much exercised in Divine Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And to provoke others to the like exercise, he would often speak what inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable sweetness and satisfaction his Soul had found in his stated Meditations upon the <hi>Divine Attributes</hi> distinctly, one by one. In Prayer he was not ordinarily so much in Confessing of sin, and complaining of Corruption and Infirmities (tho he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a due sense of these) as in admiring and praising God in his infinite Glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and in the mention of his wonderful works, perticularly of those wonders of his Love revealed in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His whole Life also was beautified and adorned with the admirable Lustre of his perticular, Personal Graces. As</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He was made up of Love. His sweet, amiable, and courteous carriage was such as made him the delight of his acquaintance, and it made way for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">His Love.</note> both of his serious Counsels, and severe reproofs. His compassion to those in distress: His bounty to those in want, His forbearance in case of offences: His af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Language, and deportment: His readiness to all obliging Offices of Love to all sorts with whom he conversed, did evidently shew how he loved them. Especially his Love was more fully let forth to the Congregation where he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Ministry. His ardent Longings after their Souls: His rejoycings in the Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of their Souls: His bleedings, and heart-breakings for their falls and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: His uncessant Labours among them, both publickly, and from House to House: His frequent and affectionate Letters to them when he was absent: His
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62667:93"/> earnest desire to Live, to die, and to be buried among them, do all shew what a great room they had in his heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was a Man of Courage: He feared no danger in the way of his <note place="margin">His courage.</note> Duty, knowing that he that <hi>walks uprightly, walks surely.</hi> In doubtful Cases he was inquisitive; but when once resolved, he was fearless. He feared not the faces of Men, but where just occasion was, he would boldly admonish, and faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what he saw amiss, which ungrateful duty he managed with so much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and with such expressions of Love and Compassion to their Souls, as made <note place="margin">His prudence.</note> way into their hearts, and made his work the more successful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He was a Son of Peace: A zealous peace-maker among Bretheren in case of dissention: And of sober and peaceful principles: Of a healing Spirit as to <note place="margin">His peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> factions upon the account of Religion. He had a Reverend esteem of Magistrates, abhorring all provoking and insolent Expressions, or Mutinous actions against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He was a great lover of Truth and Righteousness in his own practice, <note place="margin">His righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> and a great presser of them upon others, especially upon Professors of Religion; whom he exhorted to be just in their dealings, and true in their words: Wary in promising, and punctual in performing. Oft did he bewall and sharply reprove promise breaking, and deceitful dealing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> His patience was very Exemplary. Not only in his sufferings from Men; <note place="margin">His patience.</note> But in the time of his long and great weakness and Languishing distempers, which lay upon him for some years, yet all that while he had a constant calmness and serenity of Spirit, and was so far from murmuring, or discontent, that he was still blessing God for dealing so gently, and tenderly with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He was eminent in Liberality: He not only did, but devised Liberal <note place="margin">His liberality.</note> things. He studied, and considered how he might both give himself, and how he might procure others to give relief to those that were in want. He dayly gave much Almes, both in the place where he lived, and where ever he came. When Collections were made for Pious, or Charitable uses, he stirred up others, both by his Exhortations and Example; and sometimes made addition in secret to what he had given publickly. He was very bountiful to many of his Relations who were fallen into decay: Yet his means was not above eighty pounds a year: Only his Wife, for divers years kept <hi>a Boarding School,</hi> which did considerably enlarge his Estate. He took great pains in Riding abroad to Gentlemen, and other rich Men to procure a standing maintenance for <hi>Non-Conforming</hi> Ministers that were in want.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> He was of an active Spirit: He went about doing good; and as he <note place="margin">His activity.</note> was incessant in his Labours in the Congregation where he lived, so where ever he came he would be scattering some good seed, not only among those of riper years, but among the Children where he came, asking them Questions; giving them Counsel, which sometimes he left in writing among them. Especially in his own Family, among his Wives Boarders, he so deported himself that in many of them he begat the awe and Love as of Children to their Fathers.</p>
               <p>Whilst he lay sick at the Bath he sent for many poor persons, both Aged, and Children, and gave them <hi>Catechisms,</hi> engaging them to learn, and to give him an account of their proficiency therein, and they came chearfully and willingly to him, being encouraged thereunto by his Familiar and winning carriage, his giving them Mony, and by feeding and feasting them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> He was very Humble. Tho God had highly exalted him in the hearts <note place="margin">His humility.</note> and Judgments of others, yet was he low in his own eyes, and despised the praise of Men. His whole deportment favoured of Humility, and he was of a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention to the weekest and meanest,</p>
               <p>As a Minister, besides his Labors in that great Congregation where the Lord had <note place="margin">His great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.</note> placed him, the care of many other Churches lay dayly upon him. He went abroad frequently into other Parishes about the Country, amongst poor ignorant People that lived in dark Corners, having none to take care of their Souls, preached to them himself, and stirred up many of his Brethren to do the like, whose forward minds readily joyned with him in setting up <hi>Lectures</hi> in several places. He had an Eye to the poor <hi>Welch,</hi> and had an influence upon sending some Ministers among them, Intending also to have spent some time among them himself, and was hardly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62667:94"/> from it by all the perswasions of his friends, who told him his inability to Travel by reason of the great weakness that he lay under.</p>
               <p>The reading of this did so inflame the zeal of my Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Thomas Gouge</hi> (as himself told me) that he was restless in his Spirit, till (having setled his affairs about <hi>London)</hi> he had liberty, and opportunity to prosecute this design: Since which time he hath made many Journies both into <hi>South</hi> and <hi>North Wales,</hi> where he hath done much good, and by the help of divers of his Reverend Brethren in the Ministry, and many others, hath placed out many Hundreds of poor Children to School to learn <hi>English,</hi> hath given them <hi>Catechisms,</hi> and other good Books: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Bibles</hi> and <hi>New-Testaments</hi> in <hi>Welch,</hi> and hath procured the Printing of <hi>Welch Bibles</hi> (whereof there were very few to be had,) of the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> &amp;c. To be distributed among them, as is well known to many who have put to their helping hands to promote so excellent, and worthy a work:</p>
               <p>See what Testimony Mr. <hi>George Newton,</hi> the Reverend Pastor of <hi>Tawnton,</hi> gives of <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Newtons</hi> Testimony of him.</note> Mr. <hi>Jos. Allein,</hi> whose assistant he was. Mr. <hi>Joseph Allein</hi> (saith he) came to my as<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sistance, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1655. being then about one and twenty years old, and we continued together, till the <hi>Black day</hi> came. He was a young Man of singular-accomplishments, both natural and acquired. His intellectuals solid, his memory strong, his affections lively, his learning much beyond the ordinary size: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, his holiness was eminent; his conversation exemplary; and in brief, he had a good head and a better heart.</p>
               <p>Much of his time he spent in private converses with God and his own Soul: <note place="margin">His secret duties.</note> He much delighted to perform secret Devotions in the sight of Heaven, and in the open air, when his opportunities served. Many dayes he kept alone, and then (by his good will) he would betake himself to a solitary House, probably, that he might freely use his voice as his affections led him to, (which he could not have done where there were Inhabitants) and that he might converse with God without avocation and distraction.</p>
               <p>His society with others was alwayes mingled with holy and heavenly discourses. <note place="margin">His reproofs.</note> He took all opportunities to instruct, exhort, and reprove, which he never failed to do (when he judged it necessary) whatever the event might prove. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his reproofs were accompained with such humility tenderness, Self-Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and compassion, that they seldom, if ever did miscarry.</p>
               <p>In the Houses where he sojourned his Lips fed many, God freely poured grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">His usefulness where ever he came.</note> his lips, and he freely poured it out to others. None could live quietly in any open sin under his inspection. When he came to abide in any House, he brought Salvation with him, and when he departed, he left Salvation behind him. When he was transplanting himself from one Family to an other, (as his occasions some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times required) he would call all the People, one by one into his Chamber, from whence (it was observed) that scarce any one returned with dry eyes.</p>
               <p>In the duties of the first Table he was very exemplary, and near to rigour. His <note place="margin">He respected all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</note> Righteousness exceeded even tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the <hi>Pharisees:</hi> Yet also was he as exact in the duties of the second Table: A Man of morals; Never spotted with any unjust, or uncharitable act. The failing of many Professors in this kind, drew from him many Prayers, Tears, Complaints, and Lamentation.</p>
               <p>He had an eminent free and bountiful heart, to his power, yea, and beyond his power, as is before expressed. He did <hi>good to all; especially to the Houshold of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His bounty.</note>
                  <hi>Faith:</hi> He was full of holy projects, for the advancement of both Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good of others, which he so vigorously and prudently prosecuted, that they seldom miscarried.</p>
               <p>He was a Man of extraordinary condescention to the Infirmities of weaker Brethren, <note place="margin">His humility.</note> and used to deal with them in so humble, loving and sweet a way, <hi>as considering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, lest he also might be tempted.</hi> In their Confessed failings he was not Supercilious and censorious, but laboured to <hi>restore them with the Spirit of meekness.</hi> He <hi>believed and hoped all things</hi> that were to be believed and hoped: And when he deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the action, he would not Judge of the Estates of the Person. And tho he was sufficiently mild in his Judgment of others, yet was he severe enough in his Judgment of himself.</p>
               <p>In matters doubtful and disputable, he was not peremptory: He laid not more <note place="margin">His holy pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> weight and stress upon <hi>Notions,</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> in Religion than belonged to them:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62667:94"/> He was not like many who are over-confident in their determinations, that they will hardly hold Communion, nay, scarce so much as a pleasing Conversation, with any Man (how gracious soever) who cannot think, and speak, and act as they do in every thing. He would freely and familiarly converse with those, who were sound in the Faith (as to the Fundamentals of Religion,) and Holy in their lives, of all perswasions.</p>
               <p>His Ministerial imployments were more facile to him than to many others, being <note place="margin">His Ministerial abilities.</note> of a quick conceit, of a ready, strong and faithful memory; of a free, and nervous expression; and (above all) having a holy heart that was alwayes boiling up with good Matter. He was apt to Preach and Pray, and ready on all occasions to lay out himself in such work; tho his warning sometimes was very short, he confidently cast himself upon the Lords assistance, who had never failed him, and so went free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about his work without distractions.</p>
               <p>He began upon a very considerable stock of Learning, having gifts both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial <note place="margin">His learning and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and personal, much beyond the proportion of his years, and grew exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in his abilities and graces in a little time, so that his profiting appeared unto all Men; and he waxed very rich in Heavenly Treasure, by Gods blessing on a diligent hand, so that he <hi>was behind in no good gift.</hi> God blessed him with all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual blessings in Heavenly things, and he returned all to Heaven again. He ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God with all his might, and with all his strength. He was <hi>abundant in the work of the Lord:</hi> He did not go but run the wayes of Gods Commandments. <hi>He did run, and was not weary; He did walk and was not faint.</hi> He pressed hard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mark till he attained it. His race was swift and short, and his end glorious.</p>
               <p>He was insatiably greedy of the Conversion of Souls, wherein he had no small <note place="margin">His zeal.</note> success in the course of his Ministry: And to promote this end he poured out his very heart in Prayer and Preaching. He imparted, <hi>not the Gospel only, but his own Soul to his hearers.</hi> His Supplications and Exhortations were many times so affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, so full of holy zeal, and Life, that they quite overcame his Auditors. He so melted over them, that he thawed, mollified, and sometimes dissolved the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest hearts. But while he melted others he wasted, and at last consumed himself.</p>
               <p>He was not satisfied with these his publick employments, but constantly went from House to House, and there perticularly (where he had a free Reception) dealt <note place="margin">He went from house to house.</note> both with Governours, Children and Servants, instructing them especially in the great fundamentals, both of the Law and Gospel, whom he found to be ignorant: Gently reproving where he found any thing amiss: Exhorting them to diligence, both in their general and perticular Callings. And where he found any defective in it, he earnestly intreated them to set up the Worship of God in their Families, and to make them little Churches by their constant reading of the Word of God, that so the Word of <hi>Christ</hi> might dwell <hi>Richly in them;</hi> as also by a careful Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising both of Children, and Servants, and (according to the Governors abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) that they should, by conference, Repetition of Sermons, and especially by Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening Prayer, avoid that dreadful indignation which hangs over the heads of those families which call not upon the Name of Lord. He inspected, so far as he could, into the state of every perticular person, and accordingly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, <note place="margin">The benefit of it.</note> comforted, and encouraged as he found occasion: Yet all, with so much tenderness, humility and self denial that he gained much upon the affections of all that entertained him, and wrought them at least to an outward Conformity; insomuch as such as were not visited at the first, at length came forth and called upon him to come and help them also.</p>
               <p>Thus did he wear out himself to give light and heat unto others. He allowed himself too little sleep to Recruit those Spirits which he had wasted with labor <note place="margin">His early rising.</note> and wakening. He rose constantly at four a clock in the Morning at farthest, and that in the cold winter time, that having had Communion with God he might be the earlier at his other studies and imployments.</p>
               <p>He was a very grave, strict, serious Composed young Man, yet not rigid in his principles. His <hi>Moderation</hi> was known to all that knew him. He held that Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">His moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> in a Church was many times necessary, from the known corruptions of it: But allowed not separation from a Church, where active compliance with some sinful evil, was not made the condition of Communion.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:62667:95"/>
               <p> When he Catechised the greater sort in publick, he began with Prayer for a <note place="margin">His Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</note> blessing upon that duty. Then having propounded some Questions out of the <hi>Assemblies Catechism,</hi> his care was, not only to make them perfect in rehearsing the Answers there set down, but also to bring them to a clear understanding of the sence and meaning of the said Answers, and of all the Terms and Phrases in which they were expressed: And to draw some practical inferences from the same. He farther instructed them, by proposing several other <hi>Collateral</hi> Questions. besides those in the <hi>Catechism,</hi> which himself had before drawn up, and sent them in writing.</p>
               <p>In the Evening of each Lords day, he used to repeat his Sermon in the Church to which very many people resorted, and when he had done, some Youths were <note place="margin">His Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> called forth who gave him an account of all the Heads of his Sermon by their Memories.</p>
               <p>When he went from House to House, he used to give them notice the day before: Desiring that he might have admitance, and that they would have their whole Family together against he came: Which being done, he used to instruct the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">His private instructions.</note> sort in the principles of Religion, by asking Questions out of the <hi>Catechism,</hi> the answers whereunto he used to open, and explain. He used also to enquire of them about their Spiritual Estate, laboring to make them sensible of the evil and danger of sin. Of the Corruption and depravation of our Natures, the misery of an Unconverted state; provoking them to look after the true Remedy propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Gospel, to turn from all their sins unto God, to close with <hi>Christ</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own terms, to follow after holiness, to watch over their hearts and lives, to mortifie their Lusts, to redeem their time, and to prepare for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. These things he explained to their understandings, and pressed upon their Consciences with the most cogent Arguments and Considerations he possibly could; Shewing what great priviledges they did injoy, the many Gospel Sermons they did or might hear, the many Talents they were entrusted withal; and the great account they were to give unto God of the same, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Besides, he left with them several Counsels and Directions to be carefully remembred and practised for the good of their Souls.</p>
               <p>Such as were serious and Religious he used to help forward in Holiness, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering <note place="margin">His prudence.</note> their doubts, resolving their cases, and encouraging them against their difficulties and discouragments: And before he left them he used to deal with the Governors, and with such as were grown up to years of discretion singly and a part, that so, (as much as possibly he could) he might know the condition of each perticular person, and the better apply himself to each of them. If he found them to neglect Family duties, he used to press them to set them up, by reading the word of God and Prayer, giving them directions therein, and exhorting them to the practice of secret Duties. He also perswaded Mistresses of Families to give their Children and Servants time for such secret duties, and to encourage them therein: And sometimes himself would pray with them before his departure. If the Family where he came was ignorant, he would insist the longer in instructing, and Catechising: If loose, in reproving and convincing; if Godly in encouraging and directing.</p>
               <p>He used to spend five afternoons every weak in these exercises, from one or two <note place="margin">His great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</note> a clock till seven: In which space he used to visit thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> or four Families, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more as they were Greater or less. Thus he went through the whole Town, and then presently began again: And he did often bless God for the great success that he found in these Exercises; saying, that God made him hereby as instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the good of Souls as by his publick Ministry.</p>
               <p>He was a faithful Reprover of the miscarriages of Professors, whether high or <note place="margin">His reproof.</note> low, Ministers or private Christians; Yea, tho they were never so dear unto him, or never so obliging in their carriage towards him, whatsoever the issue and event might prove. Tho he was but a young Man, yet was his deportment very seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and grave. He was Humble, Courteous, and Affable, Condescending to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with the Poorest and meanest for their Spiritual good, as soon as with the highest and richest. He was full of Holy projects by what wayes and means he might most effectually promote the Honour of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Salvation of Souls, and what he judged to be conducing to these ends, he prosecuted with the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62667:95"/> Wisdom and vigour, that he seldom failed to accomplish it.</p>
               <p>He considering how much the Conscientious and frequent performance of the <note place="margin">About selfe examination.</note> duty of Self-examination might tend to the weakning of sin, and to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Holiness both in Heart and Life, he earnestly pressed this practice in his publick Ministry; directing his hearers for the performance of it: He dealt also with them in private about it, and drew a promise from most of them, that they would every night, before they went to sleep, spend some time in secret, to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to an account how they had spent that day, by proposing several Questions to their own hearts, which he had drawn up in writing, and Communicated unto them under several Heads; and many confessed that this practice had been very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious unto them in their Christian walk.</p>
               <p>Before the Act of Uniformity came forth, he was very earnest with God day and night, to make his way plain unto him, that he might not be deprived of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent advantages of saving Souls, with any scruple upon his Conscience: But when <note place="margin">His Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</note> he saw those Clauses of <hi>Assent</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> and renouncing the <hi>Covenant,</hi> he was fully satisfied against it; whereas before he was so doubtful that his intimate friends thought that he would have conformed, saying that he would not leave his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry for small and dubious matters: Yet tho he must quit his Station, he judged that the Ejection of the Ministers out of their places did not disoblige them from Preaching to their people, nor the people from attending upon their Ministry: And tho upon that <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Dismal Sabbath,</hi> he took his leave of his beloved People; yet he firmly resolved to go on with his work of Preaching in private, and Visiting from House to House, till he should be sent to Prison, or into Banishment. And accordingly he prosecuted this resolution, appointing the <hi>Thursday</hi> following to be a day of Humiliation, where he Preached in his own House to as many as durst ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to hear him; but there was not such an appearance as he expected: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he applyed himself to those who were most timerous, labouring to give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to their scruples, and it pleased God, in a short time to give him such good success, that his own people waxed bold, and Multitudes resorting to his Meetings, whether they were by day or night, which so encouraged him that he went on vigorously in Preaching, Visiting, and Catechising from house to house.</p>
               <p>He went also frequently into the Villages, and places about the Town, whence most of their Ministers were fled, or at least, desisted for some considerable time; <note place="margin">His indesatiag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness.</note> and where ever he came, the Lord was pleased to give him great success: Many were Converted, and the generality encouraged to cleave close unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>This much heigthened the rage of some Neighbour Justices, who much threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">His Enemies.</note> and oft sought for him: But it pleased God that he was preserved out of their hands longer than he expected. His usual saying was, that if it pleased the Lord to grant him but three Months Liberty before he went to Prison, he should account it a great favour, and should more willingly submit to it when he had done some work. Then did he sell off his Goods the better to prepare for a Gaol or Banishment, only he was desirous that his Wife should accompany him, which also was her great desire, it being more grievous to her to think of being absent from him, than to suffer with him.</p>
               <p>The Lord was pleased so far to indulge him, that he went on in this course from <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day, til <hi>May</hi> the <hi>26th.</hi> following, tho he was often threatened, yet was he never interrupted, tho many, both of Town and Country came flocking to his <note place="margin">His frequent Preaching.</note> Meetings at what time soever they were held. He seldom missed of Preaching twice a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and often in the week. Sometimes he Preached fourteen times in eight days: Often ten, and ordinarily six or seven, either at home or abroad, during all this time, besides his frequent discoursings with such as resorted to him: And for the better enabling him hereunto, he laid aside all his other Studies, expecting that his time and liberty would be but short. And truly the Lord did more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily assist him, as himself took notice, as well as all that heard him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with him.</p>
               <p>Upon a <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Evening, about six a clock, he was seized upon by an Officer of <hi>Taunton,</hi> who professed that he had rather have been otherwise employed, but that he was urged to a speedy Execution of the <hi>Warrant,</hi> by one who was sent on purpose to see it Executed, because they feared that none in the Town would do it.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:62667:96"/>
               <p> The <hi>Warrant</hi> was signed by three Justices, who required his present appearance <note place="margin">His apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> at one of their Houses, about two Miles off from <hi>Taunton.</hi> He desired liberty to stay and Sup with his Family, expecting but hard entertainment whether he was going; yet this small courtesie was denyed him, till one of the Chief in the Town was bound for his speedy Appearance: At Supper he fed heartily, and was very chearful, yet full of holy and gracious discourses, suitable to the time and Company that were with him. After supper, having prayed with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Friends present, himself with the Officer, and two or three friends that accompanied him, went to the appointed place, where they charged him with break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Act of Ʋniformity</hi> by his frequent Preaching since it took place: This he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, saying, that he had neither Preached in Church, Chappel, nor in any other place of publick Worship, since that time, and that what he did was in his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and with such friends as came to hear him.</p>
               <p>Then they charged him for being at a <hi>Riotous Assembly:</hi> He answered, that at their Meetings were used no Threats, no dangerous Words, no Staves, or Weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, neither were any put into fear, their only employment being Prayer and <note place="margin">He is abused.</note> Preaching. Here they much abused him with Scoffs and Scorns, the very Justices themselves with their Ladies, and such others as came to hear his Examination. One of them called him <hi>Rogue,</hi> and said that he deserved to be hanged, and that if he were not hanged, he would be hanged for him; and many other scurrilous expressions they used, which would but defile the paper if they were set down. They urged him much to be his Self-Accuser, but could not draw him to it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which, they made a <hi>Mittimus</hi> to send him to the Gaol upon <hi>Munday</hi> Morning after they had detained him with them till twelve a Clock in the night. <note place="margin">Commited.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When he came home, which was about two a clock in the Morning, he lay down on his Bed about two or three hours, and then arising, he retired himself with God till about eight a clock: At which time several Friends were come to visit him, to whom he would have Preached, but that he was not suffered by the Officer, who had a strict charge to the contrary: Yet he spent the day in discoursing with the several Companies of his Friends, who out of the <hi>Town</hi> and Country came to Visit him; and as he could be permitted, he prayed oft with them. All this while he was very chearful in Spirit, admiring Gods Mercies to him, and encouraging all that came to see him to be bold and resolute in the cause of God and his Gospel, and for their Souls, and not to be discouraged for what befel him for their sakes. As for himself, he said, that he was nothing at all moved for it, nor did in the least, repent of any thing that he had done, but accounted himself happy, and under that promise which <hi>Christ</hi> makes to his <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he should be doubly and trebly happy, now that he was to suffer for his sake. He was also earnest with his Brethren in the Ministry that came to see him, that they should not at all desist from their Labours when he was gone, and that there might not be one Sermon the less in <hi>Taunton</hi> for his absence. He exhorted also the people, that they should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Ministry with greater ardency, dilligence, and courage than before, assuring them how sweet and comfortable it was to him to consider how much he <note place="margin">His courage.</note> had done for God in those last Months: Adding that he was going to Prison full of Joy, being confident that all these things would turn to the furtherance of the Gospel, and the glory of God.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Allein</hi> was not satisfied to go away till he had left some Exhortations with his people, and therefore requested them to come to him about one or two a clock in the night, and notwithstanding the unseasonableness of the time, many Hundreds of old and young repaired to him with whom he spent about three hours in Prayer and Preaching. And so with many yearnings of Bowels they took their leaves each of other, wherein a more affectionate parting could scarce be seen.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> Morning about nine a clock, he with two or three friends that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired <note place="margin">He goes to Prison.</note> to accompany him, went for <hi>Ilchester.</hi> As he went, the Streets of <hi>Taunton</hi> were beset on both sides with people, and many followed him on foot, some Miles out of the Town with great Lamentations, which he could scarce bear: Yet the Lord so strengthened him that he went through them all with great courage and Joy, endeavouring both by his words and countenance to encourage and chear them up.</p>
               <p>He carried his <hi>Mittimus</hi> himself having no Officer with him, and when he came <note place="margin">Himself carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
                  </note> thither the Jaylor was not at home, which opportunity he took to Preach before
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62667:96"/> he went into Prison, which his Adversaries accounted a great addition to his former Crimes. The Jaylor being come home, he gave him his <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and was by him put into the <hi>Bridewel-Chamber,</hi> where he found Mr. <hi>John Norman,</hi> late of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Prison fellows.</note> Committed a few days before him for the same cause: A Man he was of singular abilities, fervent in zeal and holy boldness for the cause of <hi>Christ:</hi> Constant to his principles in the most wavering times, and one, who for his Godly and Exemplary Conversation, was much esteemed among the people of God; and few that knew him, either of the sober Gentry or Commonalty, but for his choice parts, and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less life had great respects for him.</p>
               <p>There were also five more Ministers, and fifty <hi>Quakers,</hi> which had all their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the same room, parted only with a <hi>Mat,</hi> which they had hung up for a little more retirement. Soon after Mr. <hi>Coven,</hi> Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> and eight more were brought into the same place, being taken at Meetings. This added to the straitness of their room, and it was so nigh to the top of the Prison, that as they lay in their Beds they could touch the Tiles with their hands, which made it very irksome, the Sun lying upon the House all the day: Being so many of them together, besides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort of many friends to them, they much wanted fresh air, till they had taken down <note place="margin">His convenient Lodging.</note> the glass and some of the Tiles, for their better refreshment. In this Room they were forced to lie, and to eat their food, having no other place to retire into but a little Garden, adjoyning to the place were all the Common Prisoners were. In their Chamber they were molested with the noise of those wretches, the ratling their Chains, the Blaspheming of their Tongues, their Roaring and Singing night and day being a great trouble to them. And if they went into the Courts of the Prison, there they met with the sent and sight of their Cloaths hanging full of vermin, and of the Prisoners in their Rags and Chains.</p>
               <p>That also which most troubled them was that they had no place to retire into, neither alone nor together wherein they might have Communion with God. The <hi>Quakers</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quakers wickedness.</note> also much molested them, disturbing them with their Cavils in the times of Prayer, Preaching, and Singing, and would come and Work in their Callings just by them at such times, to their great grief. Want of air was most offensive to Mr. <hi>Allela,</hi> who had accustomed himself both in <hi>Oxford</hi> and the Country, to spend most of his secret hours in by-places in the fields or woods.</p>
               <p>So soon as Mr. <hi>Allein</hi> came into Prison, he Prayed and Preached, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <note place="margin">He consecrates his Prison.</note>
                  <hi>the Consecration of it.</hi> And after a day or two he desired to have his Wife with him or near him in the Town, to attend him, and to keep Company with such Friends as came to visit him: Whereupon he prevailed with the Keeper to have one Corner to himself wherein to set his Bed, which was more private than the rest. About this he made a Partition with some Curtains, whereby he might be the more private, and it was a great comfort to him: And after a few weeks he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red leave of his Keeper, to walk out a Mile or more, Morning and Evening constantly, except the Weather, or his Keepers Churlishness did hinder him.</p>
               <p>Their Diet was good and sufficient; sometimes abundant, by their Friends kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">Kind friends.</note> to them. Here they Preached once a Day constantly: Sometimes twice, and many resorted to their Sermons, of which some came eight or ten Miles round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout out of the Country, and multitudes came to visit them. Their Friends were exceeding kind to them, endeavouring by their frequent visits, by provisions of Food, and supplies of monies to take away the tediousness of their Imprisonment. Mr. <note place="margin">His great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.</note>
                  <hi>Alleins</hi> Labours were the greatest, who spent almost all the day in conversing with his friends, and a great part of the night in his studies, and secret duties.</p>
               <p>Thus they continued for about four Months, and were tossed from <hi>Sessions</hi> to the <note place="margin">He is brought to the <hi>Sessions.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Assizes. July 14th.</hi> Mr. <hi>Allein</hi> was brought to the <hi>Sessions</hi> held at <hi>Taunton,</hi> and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for Preaching on the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> precedeing; but the Evidence was so slender that the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> would not find the <hi>Bill,</hi> and thereupon, by the constant practice <note place="margin">Acquited and yet impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.</note> of the Court, he should have been freed by Proclamation: Yet was he returned unto Prison till the <hi>Assizes:</hi> And to his Friends, who had hoped for his Deliverance, he said, <hi>Let us bless God that his Will is done, and not the Wills of such worms as we are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August 24th.</hi> He was Indicted at the <hi>Assizes,</hi> and tho the Evidence was but the same with the former, yet now the <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> found the <hi>Bill,</hi> and he was brought <note place="margin">To the <hi>Assizes.</hi>
                  </note> to the Bar, and his Indictment was Read, which was, that <hi>May 17th.</hi> 1663. He,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62667:97"/> together with twenty others to the Jurors unknown, did Riotously, Routously, and Seditiously assemble themselves together, contrary to the Peace of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord the King, and to the great terrour of his Subjects, and to the evil Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this he Answered, That as to Praying and Preaching he <note place="margin">Found Guilty and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> was Guilty, and did own them for his Duty: But as for Riotous, Routous, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Assemblies, he abhorred them from his heart, and of these he was not Guilty. Yet was he found Guilty by the <hi>Petty Jury,</hi> and by the Judge Sentenced to pay a hundred Marks, and to continue in Prison till it was paid. To this he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: That he was glad that he had appeared before his Country: And that, whatsoever he was charged with, he was Guilty of nothing but doing his Duty; <note place="margin">His Speech to the Judge.</note> and that all which did appear by the Evidence was only that he had Sung a <hi>Psalm,</hi> and instructed his Family, where some others were, and both in his own House: And that, if nothing which had been urged would satisfie he should with all chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and Thankfulness accept, whatsoever Sentence his Lordship should pronounce upon him for so good, and Righteous a cause. From hence he was carried back to Prison, where he continued a whole year wanting three days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Winter</hi> coming on, which they feared would make this place as cold as it had been hot in <hi>Summer</hi> (the Chamber having no Chimney in it) they endeavoured, and <note place="margin">His remove to the Ward.</note> with some difficulty obtained to be removed to the <hi>Ward,</hi> where they had more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable accommodations in all respects. Here they had very great Assemblies, both on week days and <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and many days of Humiliation, and Thanksgiving; and tho they were much threatened both by the Judges and Justices to be sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-Sea, or carryed to some remote Island, where they should be kept close Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners; yet the Lord prevented it, and so ordered it, that their Imprisonment tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his greater glory, and to the furtherance of the Gospel, by their great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, to which God added a great Blessing: And Mr. <hi>Alleins</hi> sufferings did not in the least abate his Zeal, and Activity for God, but he embraced all opportunities <note place="margin">His zeal and activity.</note> of doing good. The Minister who was appointed, at some times to Preach to the Felons, falling sick, Mr. <hi>Allein</hi> freely supplyed his room as long as he could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, earnestly exhorting them that by Repentance, and Faith they would secure the Eternal welfare of their Souls. He was very forward to promote the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of young persons, both in <hi>Ilchester,</hi> and in the Country adjacent; for which <note place="margin">His care for young persons.</note> end he gave <hi>Catechisms</hi> to many Poor Families, that they might be instructed in the principles of Religion, exhorting the Elder to teach and encourage the Younger. He was a serious and faithful <hi>Monitor</hi> to his Fellow-sufferers, if he saw in them any thing which became not the Gospel for which they suffered.</p>
               <p>He was now, as formerly, a careful Redeemer of his time, rising about four a clock <note place="margin">Redeeming time.</note> in the Morning, and spending a considerable time in Meditation and Prayer, and then following his studies close in some Corner of the Prison where he could be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: And sometimes he spent almost whole nights in these exercises, only lying down in his Cloths for an hour or two, and then up again. Those which visited him he did not entertain with frivolous and frothy discourses, but with such as <note place="margin">His prudence.</note> were profitable, and for their Edification, applying himself unto them according to their several capacities, exhorting them to such gracious practices, which by Reason of their age or temper, Calling or Condition, he judged them to be most defective in, and dehorting them from such evils, as he thought them most prone unto. He rejoyced that he was accounted worthy to suffer in the cause of <hi>Christ,</hi> and encouraged the timerous; by his own and others experience of Gods goodness beyond what they could have expected.</p>
               <p>He carefully observed that Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. <hi>Love your Enemies, bless them that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His candor.</note>
                  <hi>curse you; Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despightefully use you, and persecute you.</hi> He never exclaimed against those who were the chiefest instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Sufferings, but pityed and prayed with Saint <hi>Stephen; Lord lay not this sin to their charge.</hi> The greatest harm he wished them, was that they might be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, Sanctified, and their Souls saved in the day of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the time of his Imprisonment it could not be discerned that his health was impaired notwithstanding his incessant Labors. Yet, probably (as the <hi>Physicians</hi> afterwards judged) the foundation of that weakness which presently after surprized him, and occasioned his death, was then laid.</p>
               <p>At his enlargement from Prison he was more earnest in his work than before:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62667:97"/> Yet willing to preserve his liberty among his people, who had no Minister that had the oversight of them, tho some came and Preached to them in his absence: And <note place="margin">Multitudes resort to his Ministry.</note> such Multitudes resorted to him, that he judged it necessary to divide them into four parts, resolving to Preach to them four times each <hi>Sabbath;</hi> But finding that to be beyond his strength, which was much decayed, he was fain to forbear it, and Preached only twice on the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> yet oft on the week days besides, at home or abroad. He pressed all that feared God, especially such as were of a timerous Spirit, to be couragious and active for God, and to be much in mutual conversings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now that their Ministers were withdrawn, and to be much in praises and <note place="margin">Good Counsel.</note> thanksgivings unto God, delighting themselves in him, and denying themselves for him, and resigning themselves, and all they did enjoy, to him, that the world might see, that they could live comfortably on a God alone, on his Attributes and promises, tho they should have nothing else left.</p>
               <p>He much pressed the Unconverted to be more careful for the Salvation of their <note place="margin">Charity to Souls.</note> Souls, especially considering, that those were now removed, which longed for, and watched over their Souls, and they were fallen into the hands of such as wanted either skill or Will to promote their welfare: Shewing them, with most tender affections, what miserable Creatures they were whilst Unconverted, and how his heart did yearn for them: How he did pray and weep for them when they were asleep: How willingly he had suffered a years Imprisonment for them, nay, how readily he would shed his blood to procure their Salvation.</p>
               <p>But it pleased the All-wise God to take him off from this eager pursuit of his work <note place="margin">His first sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> and designs for him, by Visiting him (in the latter end of <hi>August)</hi> with much weakness, within three Months after he came out of Prison. For being requested by a people, whose Pastor was absent, to Preach, and Administer the Sacrament unto them, the place being sixteen Miles off, he was so disabled by the Journy, that he could not perform both; yet, because many of them came far, he forced himself to Preach to them, tho to his great prejudice, and after three or four days, with much difficulty he returned home, and had the advise of the best <hi>Physicians</hi> thereabout, who, all of them judged that it proceeded from his abundant Labors, and Preaching too soon after his Meals, as he did, when he Preached four times a day. This had so abated the natural heat of his stomack that no food would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, nor oft stay within him.</p>
               <p>He felt no pain, but had a constant discomposure in his Stomach, and a failing of his <note place="margin">His great weakness.</note> Appetite, that for many weeks he could not bear the sent of Flesh-Meat, nor retain any Liquors or Broths, so that he consumed so fast, that his Life seemed to draw near to an end: But God was pleased so to bless the means that after two Months, he recovered of this distemper; yet, so lost the use of his arms that from <hi>October</hi> till <hi>April,</hi> he could neither put on or off his Cloaths, nor write any thing. His <hi>Physicians</hi> and Friends earnestly besought him to intermit his Labors, but could not prevail. For he continued to Preach once, and sometimes twice every <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and to visit from House to House all that Winter.</p>
               <p>In the Spring God was pleased to restore unto him the use of his Arms, for <note place="margin">Hopes of his Recovery.</note> which he was exceeding thankful, and they had great hopes of his Recovery: And the <hi>Summer</hi> following, by making use of some <hi>Mineral</hi> Waters, near the <hi>Devizes,</hi> his strength was much encreased, and he found much good by them. But trusting too much to that strength, his weakness returned often upon him the next <hi>Winter,</hi> and more in the Spring following. Yet his fits continued not long at a time, so that he Preached, not according to, but even beyond his strength, at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: <note place="margin">His indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gableness.</note> Sometimes going into remote places, where they had had no Meetings since the removal of their Ministers, which was about the space of two years: And he engaged some of his Brethren also to take their turns, which they did with great success.</p>
               <p>Now was he again much threatened, and Warrants were often out for him, which <note place="margin">He is threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> he rejoyced at, that when (by reason of his distempers) he could do little for God, God would so honour him, that he should suffer for him in a Prison; and would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten say with much chearfulness, that they could not do him a greater kindness: But God not seeing him fit for the inconveniences of a Prison, was pleased to spare him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Five Mile Act</hi> now taking place, he removed to a place called <hi>Willington,</hi> five
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62667:98"/> Miles from <hi>Taunton,</hi> to a Dyers house in a very obscure place, where he preached on the <hi>Lords Days</hi> as he was able: But the vigilent eyes of his Enemies soon found him out there, and resolved to remove him, and a Warrant was put in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables hands to apprehend him: And the Dyer was threatned to be sent to the Goal for entertaining him: Hereupon he returned to Mr. <hi>John Mallack</hi>'s house, a Merchant, who had oft solicited him to take his house for his Home, and he now accepted of his courteous offer: But many of his Friends in <hi>Taunton</hi> were so earnest, that to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them, he went to their houses and stayed with some a Fortnight, with others three Weeks or a Month, yet still taking Mr. <hi>Mallack</hi>'s for his Home: And he went from no house without serious Counsels, Comforts or Reproofs, as their Condition required.</p>
               <p>He went from no house that was willing to part from him; nor could he satisfie the requests of one half that invited him to their houses: So that he would often <note place="margin">His usefulness in all places.</note> bless God, and say with holy Mr. <hi>Dod, That he had a hundred houses for one that he had parted with:</hi> And that tho he had no Goods, yet he wanted nothing, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther careing for him in every thing; so that he lived a far more pleasant Life, than his Enemies that had turned him out of all.</p>
               <p>He was exceedingly taken with Gods Goodness in Mr. <hi>Mallacks</hi> bountiful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of him, whose House, Gardens and Walks were very delightful to him, being so pleasant and curious, and all Accomodations within suitable thereunto; <note place="margin">Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> which made him often to say, <hi>that he did [as</hi> Dives] <hi>fare deliciously every day;</hi> but hoped to improve it better than he did: And that God had inclined his heart to care for many Poor, and for several of his Brethren in the Ministry, and that now God did reward him, not suffering him to be at any expence upon himself or Wise.</p>
               <p>He was a great Observer of each Days Providences, and would every Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went to sleep, reckon them up to his Wife, to raise his own and her heart to <note place="margin">Providence observed.</note> praise the Lord, and to trust to him, of whose care and goodness he had such mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold experiences.</p>
               <p>The time for his going to the Waters being come, he desired to keep a <hi>Day of Thanksgiving</hi> for all Gods Mercies to him and his Friends; and accordingly <hi>July</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> 1665. divers of his Brethren in the Ministry, and of his Friends in <hi>Taunton</hi> met at Mr. <hi>Mallack</hi>'s House, about a Mile from the Town; where, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had been a while together, came two Justices, with others attending them with Swords, and brake open the Doors by force (tho if they had pleased, they might have unhatched them) and with much dirision and threatning Language, took their Names, and committed them to some Constables, charging them to bring <note place="margin">His apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> them the next Day to the <hi>Castle-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Taunton,</hi> before the Justices of Peace there. The next Day the Prisoners were broughr forth, and answered to their Names as they were called; and after two Days tedious attendance, were all convicted for keeping a <hi>Conventicle,</hi> and sentenced to pay three Pounds a piece, or to be committed to Prison for threescore Days: But few of them either payed their Fines or suffered their Friends to pay it for them. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Allein,</hi> and seven Ministers more, and forty private Persons were committed to <hi>Ilchester</hi> Goal. When Mr. <hi>Allein</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Imprisonment.</note> came to the Prison, his Deportment, and Conversation was every way as exemplary as it had been in his former confinement. And notwithstanding his great bodily weakness, yet he constantly took his turn with the other Ministers in preaching, which they performed, mostly, twice a Day, besides other Religious Exercises, <note place="margin">Painfulness.</note> wherein also he did bear his part.</p>
               <p>Tho he had many of his Flock imprisoned with him, whereby he had the fairer <note place="margin">Care of his people.</note> opportunity of instructing and watching over them; yet was he not forgetful of the rest that were at liberty, but wrote many Letters to them, full of serious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable matter, from which they might reap no small benefit, whilst they wanted his bodily presence: He was also very solicitous for those that were with him, that they might be the better for their Bonds, walking worthy the many and great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies they had enjoyed during their Imprisonment; that so, when they returned to their Houses, they might speak and live forth the Praises of God, carrying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in every respect as became the Gospel for which they had suffered; which he made to appear by that wholesome Counsel which he gave them the Morning wherein they were delivered, which consisted of two Heads.</p>
               <p>The first was of Exhortation. <note place="margin">His advice at their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, to rejoyce with trembling in their Prison Comforts, and to see that they kept them in a thankful Remembrance all their Lives.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:62667:98"/> 2. To feed and feast their Faith upon Prison Experiences.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To let Divine Mercy be as Oyl to the flame of their Love. <hi>O love the Lord all ye his Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. To keep their <hi>Manna</hi> in a Golden Pot, and not to forget him, who hath said so often <hi>Remember me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To let the Bonds of their Afflictions strengthen the Bonds of their Affections, to love one another the better.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To let present indulgence fit them for future hardships.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To cast up their accounts at their return home, and to see whether they have gone as much forward in their Souls, as they have gone backward in their outward Estates.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To see that the Snuffers of the Prison make their Light to burn the brighter; and that their course and discourse be the more savoury, serious and spiritual for this present Tryal.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To see that they walk <hi>accurately</hi> as those that have the Eyes of God, Angels, and Men upon them, to see what Gainers they have been by this Affliction.</p>
               <p>The second was of Dehortation.</p>
               <p>First, Revile not your Persecutors, but bless and pray for them, as Instruments of conveying great Mercies unto you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let not the humble acknowledgment of Gods Mercy, degenerate into proud, vain-glorious boasting, or carnal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be not prodigal of your Liberty upon a conceit that the Prison will be easie, nor yet fearful of adventuring in a way of Duty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do not load others with censures, whose Judgment and Practice differs from yours, but humbly bless God that hath so happily directed you.</p>
               <p>Having spoke thus to his fellow Prisoners, he spake thus also to Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <note place="margin">His Speech to Friends.</note> with them.</p>
               <p>First, Let our experience be your encouragement. O love the Lord, ye our Friends; Love the Lord; Fear him for ever; Believe in him; Trust him for ever for our sakes. We have tasted of the kindness of God. You know how good God hath been to us both in Spirituals and Temporals. Encourage your hearts in the Lord your God: Serve him the more freely and gladly for our sakes. You see we have tryed, we have tasted how good the Lord is. Do you trust him the more, because we have tryed him so much, and found he is a Friend so faithful, so gracious, that we are utterly unable to speake his Praise. Go on and fear not in the way of your Duty: <hi>Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous.</hi> God hath given us a great Reward already; but this is but the least; we look for a Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My desire to our Friends is, that they will all help us with their Praises: Our Tongues are too little to speak forth the Goodness and the Grace of God: Do you help us in our Praises: Love the Lord the better; praise him the more, and what is wanting in us, let it be made good by you. O that the Praises of God may found abroad in the Country by our means, and for our sakes.</p>
               <p>His Imprisonment prevented his going to the Waters, which was the cause of the <note place="margin">His distempers encrease.</note> increase of his Distempers all the Winter following, and more in the Spring; yet not so much as to take him wholly off his work, but that he preached, kept many Days, and administred the Sacrament to his People.</p>
               <p>Going to the Waters in <hi>July,</hi> 1667. they had a contrary effect upon him to what they had at first; for after three days taking them, he fell into a Fever, which <note place="margin">Gods Mercy.</note> seized on his Spirits, and his strength decayed so exceedingly, that he seemed to be near Death; but the Lord was pleased to spare him, and so far to restore him, that at six weeks end he returned to his People; yet then finding a great decay in his strength and weakness in all his Limbs, he was willing to go to <hi>Dorchester</hi> to advise with Dr. <hi>Lose,</hi> an able <hi>Physitian,</hi> from whom he had received many Medicines, but had never any converse with him, nor had seen him.</p>
               <p>The Doctor soon perceived his weakness, and therefore advised him to stay there <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Dorchester.</hi>
                  </note> for a Fortnight or three Weeks, that he might direct him the better, and alter his Remedies as he should see occasion, which he readily assented to. He had not been there above five days, but the use of all his Limbs was suddenly taken from him; first his Arms, then his Legs, that he could neither stand, nor move a Finger, nor <note place="margin">His great weakness.</note> turn him in his Bed. He was given over by Physitians and Friends, that saw him
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62667:99"/> for some weeks lying in cold sweets night and day; and often, for some hours <note place="margin">His great weakness.</note> half his body was cold, so that in their apprehensions he was dying, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but strong Cordials and Broths.</p>
               <p>Thus he lay from <hi>September 28th.</hi> to <hi>November 16th.</hi> before any amendment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, all which time he was very chearful, praising and admiring God for his mercies: But his Spirits were so low that he spake seldom, and then softly. He was free from pain, and when his Friends admired his patience, he would say, that God had not yet tryed him any thing, but in laying him aside from his work, and keeping him out of Heaven. Being asked how it was with his Soul in all his <note place="margin">His inward peace.</note> bodily weakness? His answer was, that he had not those <hi>Ravishing</hi> Joys which he expected, and which some did pertake of: But he had a sweet serenity of heart and Conscience, and a confidence in God grounded upon the promises of the Gospel, and did believe that it would be well with him to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>The Ministers and Christians of that place were very compassionate unto him, <note place="margin">Great kindness to him.</note> Visiting, and Praying with and for him often. And Dr. <hi>Lose</hi> visited him twice a day for about a Quarter of a year together (except when he was out a Town) and yet would never take any <hi>Fees</hi> of him. The Gentry also in and about the Town, sent in whatsoever they imagined might be pleasing to him: So that he neither wanted food nor <hi>Physick,</hi> and he much delighted himself in the consideration of the Lords kindness to him, in the Love which he received from them, and would often say: <hi>I was a stranger, and Mercy took me in: In Prison, and it came to me: Sick and weak, and it visited me:</hi> There were also fourteen young Women that took their turns to watch with him.</p>
               <p>In this condition he kept his Bed till <hi>December 18th.</hi> And then, beyond hope, <note place="margin">His amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> in the depth of Winter he began to revive and to get out of Bed: Yet could he neither go nor stand, nor move a finger, having sense in his limbs without motion. But it pleased God that by degrees his strength increased, so that he could with help, walk a turn in his Chamber, and when (after a time) he could do it without help, he was wonderfully taken with the Lords mercy to him: And by <hi>February,</hi> with a little help, he could walk in the streets, being asked how he could be so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to lie so long under so great weakness? He answered, What? Is God my Father, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> my Saviour, and the Spirit my sweet Friend, my Comforter, and Sanctifier, and Heaven mine Inheritance, and shall I not be content without <note place="margin">His patience.</note> Limbs and Health? Through Grace I am fully satisfied with my Fathers good Pleasure.</p>
               <p>To another that asked him the same Question, he answered: I have chosen God, and he is become mine, and I know with whom I have trusted my self, which is enough. He is an unreasonable wretch that cannot be content with a God tho he hath nothing else: My interest in God is all my Joy.</p>
               <p>Some of his Friends of <hi>Taunton</hi> coming to <hi>Dorchester</hi> to see him, he was much revived, and causing his Curtains to be withdrawn, he desired them to stand round about the Bed, <note place="margin">His Speech to his Friends.</note> and caused his Wife to hold forth his hand to them, that they might shake him by it, and as he was able, he spake thus to them. O how it rejoyces my heart to see your faces, and to hear your voices, tho I cannot as heretofore speak to you. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I am now like to <hi>Old Jacob,</hi> with all his Sons about him. You now see my weak estate, and thus have I been for many weeks, since I parted from <hi>Taunton;</hi> but God hath been with me, and I hope with you. Your Prayers for me have been answered many wayes. The Lord return them into your own bosoms. My friends, Life is mine, Death is mine, in that Covenant I was Preaching of to you is all my Salvation, and all my desire: Altho my Body doth not prosper, I hope my Soul doth. I have lived a sweet Life by the Promises, and I hope (through Grace) I can die by a Promise. The Promises of God are everlasting, and will stand by us. Nothing but God in them will stand us instead in a day of Affliction.</p>
               <p>My dear friends, I feel the power of those Doctrines which I Preached unto you, upon my heart. Now the Doctrines of Faith, of Repentance, of Self-denial, of the Covenant of Grace, of Contentment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O that you would live them over now that I cannot Preach to you. Its a shame for a believer to be cast down under afflictions, who hath so many glorious Priviledges, Justification, Adoption, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Eternal Glory. We shall as the Angels of God within a little while; nay, to say the truth, Believers are, as it were, little Angels already, that live in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62667:99"/> the power of Faith. O my Friends! Live like Believers: Trample this dirty World under your feet. Be not taken with its Comfort, nor disquieted with its Crosses: You will be gone out of it shortly.</p>
               <p>When they came to take their leaves of him, he Prayed with them as <note place="margin">He blesses them.</note> his weak state would suffer him: And in the words of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Apostle, he blessed them in the same words as he used after the Sacrament. <hi>The Lord bless you, and keep you: The Lord cause his face to shine upon you, and give you peace.</hi> And <hi>the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our Lord</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his Will, working in you that which is pleasing in his sight,</hi> through <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to whom be Glory for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> Adding, Farewel, Farewel my dear Friends: Remember me to all <hi>Taunton.</hi> I beseech you and them, if I never see your faces more, go home, and live over what I have Preached unto you; and the Lord provide for you when I am gone. O Let not all my Labors and Sufferings: Let not my wasted strength; my useless limbs rise up in Judgment against you at the great day of the Lord.</p>
               <p>At another time some coming to visit him, he spake thus to them. O my Friends; <note place="margin">Counsels them.</note> Let your Conversation be as becometh the Gospel of <hi>Christ,</hi> whether I am present or absent. Live what I have spoken to you in the Name of the Lord: Now that I cannot Preach unto you, let my wasted strength, and useless limbs be a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It is for Christ and you that I have thus spent out my self, I am affraid lest some of you after all that I have spoken to you, should be lost in the world. There are many Professors who can pray well, and talk well, whom yet we shall find at the left hand of <hi>Christ,</hi> another day. You have your Trades, your Estates, your Relations: Be not taken with these, but with God, O live on him? For the Lords sake go home and take heed of the World, of Worldly cares, of Worldly Comforts, Worldly Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then he added.</p>
               <p>The Lord having given Authority to his Ministers to bless his People, I accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly <note place="margin">Blesses them.</note> bless you: And so he did in the words formerly recited. And he conversed with all that came to visit him as he was able, looking alwayes chearfully upon them, and never in the least complaining of his Afflictions, except to his <hi>Taunton</hi> Friends to excite them to their duty.</p>
               <p>In <hi>February</hi> he was very desirous to return to his People, which his Doctor assented <note place="margin">His return to <hi>Taunton.</hi>
                  </note> to; fearing that <hi>Dorchester</hi> Air in <hi>March</hi> would be too sharp for him: And Judged that it might conduce to his cure to have his mind satisfied. At his return he was much pleased with the sight of that place and of his people, who came flocking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and he so increased in strength that within a week after he was able to feed himself. But to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ent any prejudice that might come by the frequent visits of Friends, he removed to Mr. <hi>Mallacks</hi> House where he found most kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
               <p>There he increased in strength till the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and then he declined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and was soon after taken with <hi>Convulsion fits,</hi> whereof he had divers the first <note place="margin">He hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion fits.</note> day and night: But by Gods blessing upon means, he was freed from them for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three weeks, and then, being alone in his Chamber, he was taken with a Fit, wherein he fell to the ground and hurt his Face; and his Nose bled much, which blood was clotted and corrupt, which made his <hi>Physicians</hi> to conclude that that fall saved his Life: For probably had not that blood come from his head, he had died in <note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> that Fit. Going to Bed he slept so well that night, that he awaked in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning much refreshed, and full of the praises of God for his mercies to him.</p>
               <p>After this he lived alwayes in the expectation of death, saying often, <hi>It is but a</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He prepares for death.</note>
                  <hi>puff and I am gone,</hi> and therefore every night after Prayer he used to bid all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Farewel, saying he might be dead before Morning. Whilst he was undres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing he would be discoursing of Spiritual things, and when he lay down to his rest, he used to say to his Wife, we shall shortly be in an other Bed. Farewel my dear heart, the Lord bless thee: His first Speeches in the Morning usually were, now we have one day more, here is one more for God, now let us live well this day, Work hard for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ouls, lay up much Treasure in Heaven this day, for we have but a few to live.</p>
               <p>Hence forward the strength of his Limbs were so repaired, that they feared not
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62667:100"/> his relapsing again. But about <hi>May 6th.</hi> he began to find weakness in his stomack, <note place="margin">His relapse.</note> which quickly so grew upon him that he lost the use of his Limbs again, and <hi>May 12th.</hi> having lain some dayes and nights in cold sweats (as formerly) he was again taken with Convulsions, and having continued in a trance about four hours, his friends weeping about him, he at last spake thus unto them, weep not for me: My work is done: And immediatly fell into a violent Convulsion fit, that held him two hours, and presently after fell into another, wherein he ratled and was cold, insomuch as they thought every breath would be his last. His <hi>Physicians</hi> said, that his pulse was gone, and that he would be dead in a few Minutes: But God shewed his power in reviving him beyond all expectation; yet was he not able to speak to them till the next day, nor did he perfectly recover till four days after. Thus he continued every weak until <hi>July,</hi> mostly confined to his Bed, yet chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and free to discourse with any that Visited him, as long as he was able.</p>
               <p>A Proposal was made by his Wife to the Doctors, whether the <hi>Bath</hi> was not fit for him? Some were for it, others against it. But he himself was very eager for it. And a Horse-Litter being provided for him, tho he had not for many dayes been out of <note place="margin">He goes to the Bath.</note> his Bed, yet did the Lord so strengthen him that in two days he went almost forty Miles to the <hi>Bath.</hi> The Doctors there wondered to see such an object, and marvelled that he came such a Journy alive, and were very doubtful to put him in: But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Judgments he resolved to adventure himself.</p>
               <p>At his first appearing in the <hi>Bath</hi> he was such a <hi>Skelleton</hi> that the Ladies were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted to see him, as if Death had come among them, and they could not endure to look upon him. When he went first in he could stay but a very little while, yet found much refreshing by it, and had no <hi>Symptoms</hi> of his <hi>Fits</hi> as was much feared. By Gods blessing upon this means, and drinking Goats Milk, in three weeks space, he could <note place="margin">He somewhat Recovers.</note> walk about his Chamber and feed himself: His appetite came again, and his strength increased: And thus he continued till his death drew near.</p>
               <p>During this time he grew exceedingly in Grace to the Joy and Edification of <note place="margin">His growth in grace.</note> those about him. He had much Communion with God, and often such Ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Spirit from the Consolation of the Holy Ghost, that he was not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them, nor his week Body to bear them. He was more chearful than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and exceeding affectionate to his Wife, and to all his Friends, especially to such as were most Heavenly: And the Lord was pleased so to order it by his Providence that many such came to make use of the <hi>Bath,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Fairclough,</hi> Mr. <hi>How</hi> of <hi>Torríngton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Joseph Bernard,</hi> and divers of his <hi>Taunton</hi> Friends, and of <hi>Bristow</hi> Ministers, which was a great Comfort to him in that strange and wicked place.</p>
               <p>Here he had many Visiters both friends and strangers, who came to see and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him, having heard what a Monument of mercy he was; and to all of <note place="margin">He is oft visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> them he would so enlarge himself, upon all the passages of Gods dealing with him, as gave much content to all that heard him: And it did much affect many, who were Strangers to God and Religion as well as unto him. He found much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour even amongst the worst, both Gentry and others: Such as would make a Scoff at Religion in others, would hearken unto him; yea, tho he faithfully reproved <note place="margin">His prudence and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> them for their Oaths, excessive drinking, wanton carriages which he observed in the <hi>Bath,</hi> and there was none of them but did most thankfully accept it from him, and shewed him more respect after than they had done before. In which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served much of Gods goodness to him, and would often say, O how good is it to be faithful unto God: One of the vilest of these Persons said of him, that he never spake with such a Man in his Life.</p>
               <p>His reproofs were managed with so much respect to their persons, and places, that they said, they could not but take them well, tho they were sharp and plain: <note place="margin">His reproofs.</note> And his manner was before he intended to reprove them, often in the <hi>Bath</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with them of such things as might be pleasing to them, which did so engage their affections that they delighted to converse with him, who was furnished with matter of discourse for any Company, designing to make use of it for Spiritual ends, by which means he caught many:</p>
               <p>Here tho he had many Diversions, by his constant bathing every day, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Visits, besides his weakness, yet he kept his constant Seasons, four times a day, for his holy Retirements. First in the Morning from five a Clock till seven,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62667:100"/> at which time he was carried to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and again before Dinner, but then he spent less time, and about half an hour before two, just before he went abroad, He appointed his Chair-man, that carried him to the <hi>Bath,</hi> to fetch him about three a Clock, and to carry him to the Schools and Alms-houses, and to the Godly Poor, especially the Widdows, to whom he gave Mony: And would pray and confer <note place="margin">He goes abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> doing good.</note> with them about their spiritual State as their necessities required, engaging the Teachers and Governors to teach them the <hi>Assemblies Catechism,</hi> whereof he bought and gave them many dozens for the use of their Scholars, and many other small Books which he judged useful for them; and about a Week or Fortnight after he would again visit them to see what progress they had made.</p>
               <p>He also engaged several Persons to send their Children once a Week to him to be <hi>Catechised</hi> by him; and he had about Sixty or Seventy Children that came to him every <hi>Lords-day,</hi> who profited much by his Instructions, till some took such offence at it, that he was forced to desist, and the Schoolmaster was threatned to be brought into the Bishops Court at <hi>Wells</hi> for it, which frighted him and some others. He also sent for all the Godly Poor he could hear of in the City, whom he entertained at his Chamber, and gave them Mony according to his Ability, as a <hi>Thank offering</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Charity.</note> unto God for his Mercy to him, and procured two of the aforenamed Ministers to assist him in keeping a Day of Thanksgiving for the same. Tho his Sickness had been long and his Expences great; yet, he thought he could never do enough for him from whom he had received all. He always gave Mony or Apples to all the Children that came to be Catechised by him, besides what he gave to their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and the Poor; and having made Provision for his Wife, he resolved to lay up the rest in Heaven; often saying, <hi>that having no Children of his own, Gods Children should have his Estate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next work was to send Letters to all his Relations and intimate Friends, whom <note place="margin">His Letters to his Friends.</note> he exhorted to observe his Counsel, for it was like to be his last to them. He had a great desire to go to Mr. <hi>Joseph Bernard's,</hi> which was about five Miles from the <hi>Bath,</hi> to promote the Exercise of <hi>Catechising</hi> in <hi>Sommerset</hi> and <hi>Wiltshire.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> having had a great Deliverance as well as himself, he proposed to him, that by way of <hi>Thank offering</hi> unto God, they should mutually engage to joyn in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">His Thank-Offering.</note> of six thousand of the <hi>Assemblies Catechisms,</hi> and to raise some Mony among other Friends to send to every Minister in those Counties that would engage in the Work, and also to give to the Children for their encouragment in learning of it: which Work was effected by Mr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> after Mr. <hi>Alleins</hi> Decease.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Allein</hi> finding himself again to decline, judged that it proceeded from want of Bathing, and therefore returned to the <hi>Bath</hi> again, where (by the advise of the Doctor) he made use of the <hi>Hot-bath,</hi> the <hi>Cross-bath</hi> being now too cold for him, and for four days seemed to be refreshed by it; but upon the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> there appeared a great change in his Countenance, and he found a great alteration in himself; and some Friends coming to visit him, he desired them to pray for him, for his time was very short.</p>
               <p>After they had dined he was in more than an ordinary manner transported with Affections to his Wife, whom he thanked for all her care and pains about him, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">His love to his Wife.</note> up most affectionate Petitions to God for her; and the like also he did after Supper.</p>
               <p>After this, he called for a <hi>Practise of Piety,</hi> and turning from his Wife, he read to himself the <hi>Meditation about Death</hi> in the end of the Book; which his Wife taking notice of, <note place="margin">He prepares for Death.</note> asked him if he judged his End to be near? He answered that he knew not, but within a few days she should see. Then he desired her to read two Chapters to him, as she usually did every Night, and so he hasted to Bed (being not able to pray with them) undressing himself, more than he had done of many Months before. In Bed he complained of a stoppage in his Head, and had something given him to prevent his Fits, yet within a quarter of an hour he had a strong <hi>Convulsion,</hi> and God was pleased to deny success, notwithstanding all means used to remove it; these Fits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for two Days and Nights without an hours intermission.</p>
               <p>His Fits were very terrible to behold; but Prayer being made, that if the Lord <note place="margin">Prayer power<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful.</note> saw fit, he would so far mitigate his hand upon him, that he might yet utter his mind unto them before his departure; the Lord was pleased to return a gracious Answer; For whereas before he had not spoken from <hi>Tuesday</hi> Night before, upon
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62667:101"/>
                  <hi>Friday</hi> Morning about three a Clock, he called for his Wife, speaking very under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standingly (by times) all that Day; and that Night after he spake with an audible Voice for sixteen hours, such like words as you had formerly an account of: This continued, with some little intermission, till <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Evening, at which time he departed. <note place="margin">His Death.</note>
               </p>
               <p>About three a Clock that Afternoon, he had (as those about him conceived) some conflicts with Satan; for he uttered these words, <hi>Away thou foul Fiend; thou</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and victory.</note>
                  <hi>Enemy of all Mankind; thou subtile Sophister: Art thou come now to molest me? Now that I am just going? Now I am so weak, and when Death is upon me? Trouble me not, for I am none of thine. I am the Lords; Christ is mine, and I am his: His by Covenant: I have sworn my self to be the Lords, and his I will be: Therefore be gone.</hi> Which words he repeated oft over, <hi>Be gone, Be gone.</hi> In his converse with his Wife he spent most <note place="margin">His holy speeches.</note> of that time in heavenly and profitable discourses; speaking much of the place to which he was going, and his desire to be gone. I was thinking (said he, as he was dressing) of my Marriage Day; it will be shortly: O what a joyful Day will that be!</p>
               <p>Having some Broth brought him, he said blessed be the Lord for these refreshments in the way home: But, O how sweet will Heaven be! And at another time he said, I hope to be shortly where I shall neither need Meat, nor Drink, nor Cloaths.</p>
               <p>When he looked upon his weak and consumed hands, he said, these shall be changed; <hi>This vile Body shall be made like unto Christs Glorious Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, O what a Glorious Day will the Day of the Resurection be! Methinks I see it by Faith. How will the Saints then lift up their Heads and rejoyce? And how sadly will the wicked World look then?</p>
               <p>O come, let us make haste! Our Lord will come shortly, let us prepare for him.</p>
               <p>If we long to be in Heaven, let us hasten with our Work; for when that is done, away we shall be fetcht.</p>
               <p>O this vain, foolish, dirty World! I wonder how reasonable Creatures can so dote upon it! What is in it worth the looking after? I care not to be in it longer than my Master hath doing or suffering work for me; were that done, then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to the Earth.</p>
               <p>He was oft in commending the Love of <hi>Christ,</hi> and from that, exciting himself and others to Obedience to <hi>Christ;</hi> often speaking of his Sufferings and of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <note place="margin">He admired the Love of Christ.</note> As also of his Love-Letters; for so he stiled the History of his Life, Death, Resurrection, Ascention, and of his second coming; the thoughts of which, he was oft much ravisht withal.</p>
               <p>He would be often reckoning up the choice Tokens which <hi>Christ</hi> had sent him; As First, Pardon of Sin. Secondly, A Patent for Heaven. Thirdly, The Gift of the Spirit. Fourthly, The <hi>Robe of Christs</hi> Righteousness. Fifthly, The Spoils of Enemies. Sixthly, The Charter of all Liberties and Priviledges. Lastly, The Guard of his Angels; and this last he did frequently solace himself in, in the times of Imprisonment, and else where; and would say to his Wife, tho we have not such Attendants and Servants as the Great Ones of the World have, yet we have Gods blessed Angels still to wait upon us, to minister to us, and to watch over us while we are sleeping; to go along with us in our Journies, and still to preserve us from the Rage of Men and Devils.</p>
               <p>He was very much affected with the three last Chapters of St. <hi>Johns Gospel,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with Christs parting Words and Prayer for his Disciples. In brief, his Heart, his Lips, his Life was filled with Grace, which did radiently shine forth both in Health and Sickness, in Prosperity and Adversity, in Prison and at Liberty, in his own House and in Gods House; so that few that conversed with him, but they would acknowledge that they were Gainers by him.</p>
               <p>At Mr. <hi>Allein's</hi> first coming to <hi>Taunton,</hi> he so journed with Mr. <hi>Newton,</hi> and after his Ordination, administred all Ordinances joyntly with him, tho he were but an <note place="margin">His first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Taunton.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Assistant,</hi> who highly esteemed and dearly loved him. At this time he was in League with her whom afterwards he married, and Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> observing his restless Spirit, which put him upon many tedious Journies every Fortnight of twenty five Miles, to give her a Visit; thereupon he perswaded them to consummate their Marriage, which they did accordingly, <hi>October</hi> 4. 1655. After which they lived with Mr. <note place="margin">His Marriage.</note>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:62667:101"/>
                  <hi>Newton</hi> almost two years, and were very kindly entertained by him.</p>
               <p>At the end of this time, conceiving that they might be more useful by turning House-keepers, they took an House, and Mrs. <hi>Allein</hi> having been bred to her Needle, <note place="margin">Had many Tablers.</note> set up a Boarding-School, and had many Tablers and Scholars: Their Family was seldom less than twenty, sometimes thirty; and her School usually contained fifty or sixty, many coming out of the Town and Neighbourhood besides their Tablers. And the Lord was pleased exceedingly to bless their Labours and Endeavours, so that within a few years space many of them were converted, who before were Strangers to God. All the Scholars called Mr. <hi>Allein</hi> Father; and indeed he had far <note place="margin">Did much good among them.</note> more care of them than most of their Natural Parents had, and was very tenderly affectionated to them, especially to their Souls.</p>
               <p>His Practice in his Family was twice a Day to read the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to sing a <hi>Psalm,</hi> and to Pray; except when he Catechised, which was constantly once, if not twice a Week. Of every Chapter that was read, he expected an account, and also of every Sermon. He dealt with both his Servants and Scholars frequently, together and apart about the spiritual Estate of their Souls, pressing them to perform all Duties, both of the first and second Table: He also gave them sundry Books sutable to their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and Conditions, of which they gave a weekly account how they had profited by the same.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Lords-Days</hi> work was very great; for tho he preached but once in <hi>Taunton,</hi> yet he constantly was employed the other part of the Day, either in assisting some <note place="margin">His frequent preaching.</note> of his Brethren that stood in need of his help, or else went to such Places where a Minister was wanting. In his publick Repetitions and in his Catechising, his own Family, both Scholars and Servants answered him when their turn came as well as others,</p>
               <p>He was an holy and tenderly affectionated Husband towards his Yoke-fellow, to whom he expressed his Love by his great care for her both in Sickness and in Health; <note place="margin">His Love to his Wife.</note> in his provision for her after his Decease; in his delight in her Company, saying often that it was irksome to him to make a Meal without her: He used to impart unto her all his Affairs that were fit for her to be acquainted with, and to consult with her about them: He spared not to reprove her faithfully for whatsoever he judged amiss; and if himself had at any time given her offence, he would desire her to pass it by, professing that he was restless in his Spirit till he had done it.</p>
               <p>He was frequent in keeping Days of Humiliation, especially before the Sacrament. <note place="margin">Sanctified the Sabbaths.</note> He was a strict Observer of the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> the Duties whereof he did perform with such joy and alacrity of Spirit, both in publick and private, as tended much to the Edification of those that joyned with him; the like practice he pressed much upon Christians, that they should spend the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> more in Praises and Thanksgivings, as being days of holy rejoycing in <hi>Christ</hi> our Redeemer.</p>
               <p>During the time of his Health, he rose constantly about four a Clock in the Morning, and sooner on the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> if he did awake. He would be much troubled <note place="margin">His industry.</note> if he heard any Smiths, Shoomakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at work in their Trades before he was in his Duties with God, saying, <hi>O how this noise shames me! Doth not my Master de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve more than theirs?</hi> From four a Clock till eight he spent in Prayer, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> which he much delighted in, and did daily practice when alone as well as in Company; then having refreshed himself about the space of half an hour, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent to Family Duties, and after that, to his Study till about eleven or twelve a Clock.</p>
               <p>Having refreshed himself a while after Dinner, he retired into his Study to secret Prayer, and then went abroad amongst those Families which he was to visit, to <note place="margin">His visits from house to house.</note> whom he always gave notice the day before: He went forth about two a Clock, and seldom returned before seven: He would often say, <hi>Give me that Christian that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts his Time more precious than Gold.</hi> He Catechised once a Week in publick, and repeated the Sermon which he preached on the <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> on <hi>Tuesdays</hi> in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>In his visiting from house to house he found much difficulty, it having not been practised formerly; yet after in publick he had preached up the Ministers Duty to their People, and theirs to receive them when they came to promote the good of their Souls, he presently set upon the work, wherein his manner was thus;</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:62667:102"/>
               <p> He took a Catalogue of the Names of all the Families in each street, and a day or two before he intended to visit them, he used to send them word that so they might be at home, and that he might know whether they were willing to receive him or no? Such as sent slight excuses, or did obstinately refuse to admit him, he would notwithstanding go to them; And if they shut their doors against him <note place="margin">His prudence.</note> (as some would) he would speak some few affectionate words unto them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Gods Threatnings against the obstinate that despised <hi>Christs</hi> Ministers, and so depart: And shortly after he would write to them with words so full of Love, and expressions of his great desires of doing good to their Souls, as did often mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and overcome their hearts, so that many of them did afterwards entertain him readily. And in the practice of this Duty he baulked not; but visited the poor as well as the rich, tho some of their houses were very noisome and offensive to him: <note place="margin">Impartiality.</note> And tho his Labors were so abundant, yet for nine years together, he was not under the least distemper for the space of one Quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>His Wise, suspecting that his extraordinary labors would bring him into diseases, labored to perswade him somewhat to abate of them, he answered, <hi>what have I strength for, but to spend it for God? Thou art like unto</hi> Peter, <hi>still crying,</hi> O spare thy self, <hi>but I must not hearken unto thee no more than my Master did unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was very temperate in his diet, and tho he had a sharp Appetite, yet he would moderate it, knowing that it would much conduce to his health. His converse at <note place="margin">His Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> Meals was very profitable and pleasant: Whether he was at home or abroad he would take opportunities of speaking something to the Edification of others.</p>
               <p>He was much in commending and admiring the Mercies of God in every Meal: Was still so pleased in the provision that was made for him, that he would often say, <hi>he fared deliciously every day,</hi> and lived far better than the Great Ones of the world, whose Tables were far better furnished. For he enjoyed God in all, and saw his Love and bounty in what he received from him every Meal. Whence (speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Wife) he would say, <hi>O wife, I live a Voluptuous Life: But (blessed be God) it is upon Spiritual dainties: Such as the world neither knows nor tastes of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was much in minding the poor that were in want of all things, often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <note place="margin">His charity.</note> that God should make such a difference between him and them, both for this world, and for that to come: And his Charity was ever beyond his Estate. There were but few (if any) Poor Families, especially of the Godly in <hi>Taunton,</hi> but he knew their necessities, and did either by himself or by his Friends relieve them; So that his house was seldome free from such as came to make their complaints to him. He used to buy <hi>Pease</hi> and <hi>Flitches of Bacon,</hi> and distribute them twice a year in the cold and hard seasons. He kept several Children at School upon his own cost: Bought many Books and <hi>Catechisms,</hi> and had many thousand of Prayers Printed which he gave away among the poor. And when his Brethren of the Ministry were cast <note place="margin">His bounty.</note> out of their places, he himself gave 4 <hi>l. per annum</hi> towards making a publick stock for them, by which example he excited many others to do the like, yea, upon other occasions (which frequently fell out) he was so open-handed that he gave offence to his friends: So that many in the Town grudged to give what they had agreed with him for, because he gave so much. Besides all this, the necessities of his Father, and of many other, his Relations, where still craving his help, and he Ministred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them without grudging. And when he had received a more than ordinary mercy, he would set apart some portion of his Estate, which he dedicated to the Lord as a <hi>Thank-offering,</hi> to be imployed in pious and Charitable uses.</p>
               <p>When his Wife would have moderated him in these expences, his answer was, <hi>that he was laying up for God, and God would repay him.</hi> And that <hi>by liberal things he should stand, when others that censured him for it should fall.</hi> That if <hi>he sowed sparingly he should reap sparingly: If bountifully he should reap bountifully.</hi> And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <note place="margin">God blesses him the more.</note> all that he did in his Life time in this kind, yet when he came to die he had something left to dispose of to his Relations, and to his Brethren of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, besides the comfortable provision that he had made for his Wife.</p>
               <p>In brief, his whole Life was a continued Sermon, holding forth the Doctrines which he Preached, of Humility, Self-denial, Patience, Meekness, Contentation, Faith, Love to God, his Church, and People, the blessed fruit of all which he now reaps in Heaven, where he is singing praises unto God and the Lamb, which was his great delight whilst he lived in this world.</p>

                  <head>Some of his Sayings.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When the week began, he would say:</hi> Another week is now before us: Let us spend this week for God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Morning he would say:</hi> Come now let this day he spent for God. Now let us <note place="margin">His holy Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> live this one day well. Could we resolve to be more than ordinary Circumspect, but for one day at a time, and so on, we might live at extraordinary rates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the day he would ask People:</hi> How did you set out to day? Did you set out for God to day? What were your Morning thoughts?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As he walked about the House, he would make some Spiritual use of what ever did occur: And still his Lips did drop as the Hony Comb to all that were about him, to assist him in his weakness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To one that had done well:</hi> There are two things <hi>(said he)</hi> that we must specially look too after well-doing. 1. That we grow not proud of it, and so lose all. 2. That we grow not secure, and so give the Tempter new advantages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Speaking of the vanity of the World: He said,</hi> It is as good to be without the World, and to bear that state as becometh a Christian, as to enjoy the World, tho it were never so well imployed. If a Man hath Riches and layeth them out for God and for his Servants; yet it is as happy an Estate to receive Almes of another, so we bear our poverty aright, and are chearful and thankful in our low Estate: Tho yet its true, that Riches may be used to the good of others. And its more Honourable to give than to receive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another time he said:</hi> How necessary a duty is it for a Child of God placidly to suit with all Gods dispensations. A Christian must not only quietly submit to God in all his dealings, but must ever be best pleased with what God doth, as knowing that he is infinitely wise and good. O how unbecoming a Christian is it to do otherwise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another time he said:</hi> O what an alteration will shortly be made upon us? Now we are the Sons of God, but yet it doth not appear <hi>(to sight)</hi> what we shall be. Did we i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine only that we shall shine as the Sun; it were too low a conceptation of our future bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As he was dressing in a Morning, he said:</hi> O what a shout there will be when <hi>Christ</hi> shall come in his Glory? I hope all here present shall contribute to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again:</hi> I bless the Lord, I delight in nothing in this world, farther than I see God in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In his weakness he said:</hi> There are three things that must be unlearned, as being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes among Men. 1. Many think their happiness lies in having the World, when its much more in contemning the World. 2. Men think that the greatest contentment lies in having their Wills, when indeed it lies in Crossing, Mortifying, and Subduing their Wills to the Will of God. 3. Men think it their business and benefit to seek themselves, whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is the denying of themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His advise to his Friend was.</hi> 1. Value precious time while time doth last, and not when 'tis irrevocably lost. 2. Know the worth of things to come, before they come, or are present: And the worth of things present before they are past. 3. Value no mercy as it serves to content the Flesh, but as its serviceable for God, and to things Eternal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To one that Watched with him: He said,</hi> I hope to pass an Eternity with thee in the praises of our God, in the mean time let us live a life of praise whilst we are here: For it is sweet to us and delightful to God, its harmony in his ears, our failings being pardoned, and our persons and praises accepted through Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not long before his death he said to the same person:</hi> O how much hath God done for you more than for all the World of unconverted persons, in that he hath wrought his Image in your heart, and will bring you at the last to his Caelestial Glory. See now that you acknowledge the Grace of God, and give him the praises of it. For my part, I bless the Lord, I am full of his Mercy. Goodness and Mercy have followed me all my dayes: I am full and running over. And now I charge you to walk chearfully, and to follow me with your praises whilst I am alive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When he heard that there were Warrants out for his Apprehension upon the</hi> five Miles Act, <hi>being then very weak, lifting up his eyes to Heaven, with a chearful Countenance, he thanked God that would so far honour him, saying,</hi> Blessed be the Lord, I shall now give up two lives for <hi>Christ;</hi> The one in doing for him; The other in suffering for bim. I am worn out in doing for him: And now I can do no more, shall I not suffer for his sake? I bless the Lord, I look not for any happiness in this World, and I am content to stay for it till I come into the other world. I forgive mine Enemies with
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62667:103"/> all my heart: I can put up all the injuries they have done me; But I am sure God will no put them up so except they repent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Speaking of Exhoration and Reproof he said:</hi> Its the sasest course (where it may be done) to take the present opportunity, and not to suffer our backward hearts to cheat us of the present under pretence of staying for a fitter time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By way of advice for profitable discourse, he said:</hi> Its good for such Christians as need it, to study before hand what to speak, that they may alwayes have something in readiness to bring forth for the benefit of others, which will prevent impertinence.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>The Life and Death of Dr.</hi> Edmund Staunton, <hi>who Died</hi> Anno Christi, 1671.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>EDmund Staunton,</hi> was born of the Ancient and Worthy Family of the <hi>Staun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Parentage and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> in <hi>Bedfordshire, Anno Christi,</hi> 1600. His Father, Sir <hi>Francis Staunton</hi> had divers Sons, of whose Education he was more than ordinarily careful, tho he should leave them good Estates, yet he thought it not enough that they should barely live upon the Estates which he should leave them. He was of <hi>Solomons</hi> mind, that <hi>Wisdom was good with an Inheritance (Eccle.</hi> 7. 11.) Yet was he of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion too, that an Inheritance was little worth without wisdom to manage it. He abhorred the two <hi>Epidemical</hi> Vices of too many of our <hi>English</hi> Gallants (which commonly are procreative of many more) namely, <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Idleness.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved therefore to train up his Children in Learning, not only that it might be an Ornament to them, but that thereby they might be the more useful in Church or State.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Edmund</hi> (one of the Younger Brothers) being well furnished with <hi>Grammar</hi> Learning was sent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and admited into <hi>Corpus Christi Colledge,</hi> where he so industriously followed his Studies, and was taken so much notice of for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in Learning, that whilst he was yet an <hi>under-Graduate,</hi> he was chosen a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationer Fellow</hi> in that Colledge before eighteen of his <hi>Seniors,</hi> a <hi>Bedfordshire</hi> Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship falling void by the death of one Mr. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being about eighteen years old, he fell dangerously sick in the Colledge, was far <note place="margin">A special Providence.</note> spent, and near unto death, before those about him understood what his disease was, till a skilful <hi>Physician</hi> coming to him, he found it to be a <hi>Pleurisy,</hi> and ordered a Vein to be presently opened: Whereupon a <hi>Chirurgion</hi> was immediately sent for; But it was long before he could be found. At length the Messenger brought him from a Tavern, and tho he saw his way to the Colledge, yet he could not see to do his work when he came thither. He strake his Patients arm twice, but no blood came, having missed the vein.</p>
               <p>In this condition the Sottish <hi>Chirurgion</hi> left him (it being late) all night. But when he had slept himself sober, he came the next Morning very early, and knockt at the Colledge Gates, which being opened, he ran hastily to his Chamber, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if his Patient was alive? And coming in, he presently opened a vein, which (it pleased God) bled freely, and the Patient, half dead before, soon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p>Another strange deliverance he met with not long after. When he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced Batchelor of Arts, he went into the water alone to wash himself, and not <note place="margin">Another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</note> being skilled in Swimming, he fell into a deep hole, where his feet could feel no bottom: But by Gods good Providence, he caught hold of a tuft of grass by the Bank-side, and so made shift to recover himself, and to climb up the bank. Had this small help failed him, in all probability, he had there perished.</p>
               <p>These merciful deliverances and preservations, probably were preparatory to that good work, and gracious change, which God about this time began in his heart. For about the year 1620, he himself thus wrote. <hi>I had many sad, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts concerning my Spiritual, and Eternal Estate, and upon the advise of Dr.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> Barcroft, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>bought Mr.</hi> Brinsleys Watch the second part, <hi>where the sins against the Ten Commandments are set down in order, and I fell upon the work of Self-Examination; wherein this seems remarkable, that reading over the several Sins therein mentioned, my</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:62667:103"/>
                  <hi>Heart (such was the blindness and deceitfulness of it) cryed,</hi> Not Guilty of any one of them. <hi>Hereupon I began to suspect my heart, and calling upon God to enlighten mine eyes, and discover my sins to me, and then reading them over again, I judged my self guilty, yea, very guilty of most of the Sins there enumerated and set down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this I lay about two Months under a Spirit of Bondage, being full of fears and inward trouble, so that many times I durst not close mine eyes in the night; lest I should awake in Hell. I thought every night the Devil would come for me, and fetch me away: But anon the Lord was pleased graciously to shine upon me, and this remarkable passage I shall never forget. That <hi>being one Evening at Prayer all alone in the dark,</hi> (I remember the Chamber in C. C. C. and the Corner of the Chamber very well:) <hi>I was very earnest with God for the manifestation of his Love to my Soul, and the assurance of the Pardon of my sins, and at length I brake out into these</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note>
                  <hi>words</hi> (or in words to this purpose) <hi>Lord I will not out of thy presence; I will not go off from my knees till thou speak comfort to me,</hi> whereupon I was immediately filled with a strong perswasion of the Love of God to my Soul, and with Joyes unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of Glory.</p>
               <p>From this time he diligently applyed himself to Reading and Studying the Sacred <note place="margin">He chooses the Ministry.</note> Scriptures, and Divinity; and when he was <hi>Master of Arts,</hi> his Father willed him to choose his Profession, either a <hi>Lawyer, Physician,</hi> or <hi>Divine.</hi> The latter he readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pitched upon, telling his Father that he had for sometime already applyed himself to those Studies, and that he esteemed the turning of Souls to Righteousness to be the most desirable work in all the World, and that it would have the greatest Reward hereafter, tho the other two Callings where like to bring in greater Wealth and Honour here.</p>
               <p>His tender Father would not cross, but rather encouraged him, and his pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: And for that end he laid out to procure a good Living, or place of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him: In the mean while our <hi>Edmund</hi> was not idle: But being invited to <note place="margin">His success therein.</note> Preach a Lecture on the <hi>Lords-dayes</hi> in the afternoon at <hi>Witney,</hi> a Town about ten Miles from <hi>Oxford,</hi> he accepted the Call, and Preached there, well nigh half a year and had comfortable Seals of his Ministry in that place.</p>
               <p>So acceptable were his labors during his abode there, that hearers from all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces round about flocked unto him, <hi>as Doves flye to their Windows.</hi> This was not very pleasing to the <hi>Incumbent,</hi> who therefore spent the more time in reading <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayers,</hi> and when he had spun them out all he could, he himself would go out of the Church, being followed by none but his <hi>Clerk,</hi> whom he would not suffer to begin a <hi>Psalm,</hi> but either the Lecturer himself, or one Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> a Godly Man was fain to do it.</p>
               <p>The Text of Scripture that he long insisted upon, was that excellent saying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 23. 23. <hi>Buy the truth and sell it not;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Incumbent,</hi> as he met any going to Church as he went from it, would in a jeering manner say unto them, <hi>What? you are now going to buy the Truth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By his Father and Friends he had now a place provided for him, namely <hi>Bushy</hi> in <hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> and he was the more willing to accept of it, because his continuance at <hi>Witney</hi> was precarious, and the envy and opposition by the Minister of the place was not to be removed. To <hi>Bushy</hi> therefore he removed where he had a welcome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment by the generality of the Inhabitants, but especially by those which had any favour to Religion. Here he Preached, and Catechized on the <hi>Lords-dayes,</hi> and other dayes, to the great benefit of his hearers that attended his Ministry, not <note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Bushy.</hi> His labors and success.</note> only of <hi>Bushy,</hi> but others that repaired unto him from <hi>Watford,</hi> and other adjacent places. An ancient Godly Minister yet living, gave this Testimony of him under his Hand: That that little time which Dr. <hi>Staunton</hi> (saith he) spent in <hi>Bushy,</hi> was not without good success, many persons in mine own hearing, have acknowledged that his Ministry was the means of their Conversion.</p>
               <p>During his abode at <hi>Bushy</hi> (which was about two years) he repaired, or rather rebuilt at his own charges, the dwelling House belonging to the Minister. At this time also he Married a Wife, the Daughter of one Mr. <hi>Scudamore</hi> of <hi>Watford,</hi> a Man of good account in those parts, both for his Estate, and Godliness: By her he had one Daughter. Also being appointed to Preach a <hi>Visitation Sermon,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it with great applause and approbation: Yet because he sharply reproved <hi>Pluralites,</hi> and <hi>Non-Residency,</hi> some that were concerned and guilty were greatly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62667:104"/> offended; and one of them said, he might the better Preach against holding many Livings, having got so good an one himself.</p>
               <p>And indeed <hi>Bushy</hi> was so good a Living, that one Dr. <hi>Seaton,</hi> of <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> had a longing desire after it, and either finding, or making a slaw in Mr. <hi>Stauntons</hi> Title, he soon ejected him from it. But first there was a Tryal at Law about it, wherein the <hi>Attorny General Noy</hi> (who was of Counsel for <hi>Seaton,</hi> was so taken with the ingenuity of <hi>Staunton,</hi> that he moved for an exchange, and so brought it to pass that <hi>Seaton</hi> should have <hi>Bushy,</hi> and <hi>Staunton</hi> should have <hi>Kingston.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now both parties were well agreed: <hi>Staunton</hi> preferred work before wages, and liked <hi>Kingston</hi> the better because his opportunities of service would there be greater, being of that Reverend Divines mind, who was wont to say, <hi>that his opportunities were</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Winter.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>his greatest Riches.</hi> But whilst he thought of settling there, he met with a disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: <hi>Seaton</hi> having now gotten <hi>Bushy</hi> would not part with <hi>Kingston,</hi> but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Staunton</hi> must be his Curate there, or he must be gone from thence: Hereupon Mr. <hi>Staunton</hi> repaired to <hi>Noy,</hi> and Related to him the deceitful, and disingenuous carriage of his Client: <hi>Noy</hi> was of too generous a nature to approve of such base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and therefore sending for <hi>Seaton,</hi> he told him plainly, that unless he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign <hi>Kingston,</hi> he would soon pick an hole in his Title to <hi>Bushy.</hi> Divers also of the Inhabitance of <hi>Kingston</hi> (who highly prized Mr. <hi>Stauntons</hi> Ministry, and were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Kingston.</hi>
                  </note> to purchase it at any rate, did so work with Dr. <hi>Seaton,</hi> that shortly after he resigned <hi>Kingston,</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Staunton</hi> had the Presentation, and soon after his <hi>Institution</hi> and <hi>Induction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Kingston</hi> he continued about twenty years, endeavouring faithfully to discharge the Ministry which he had received of the Lord. There he Preached twice on the <note place="margin">His great pains there.</note>
                  <hi>Lords-dayes,</hi> and Catechised the younger, and the more Ignorant sort of People: Yet did he not satisfie himself in thus Teaching them publickly; But (tho the Town was large, and Populous) he taught them also from House to House, <hi>(Act.</hi> 20. 20.) Here also he set up a weekly Lecture, which was supplyed, in their turns by as Eminent Ministers as those parts of <hi>England</hi> did afford. And in a little while, partly by his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preaching, partly by his Holy and Exemplary Life, he wrought a great, and general Reformation, both among the Magistrates and People throughout the Town. He was dearly loved by all the Godly party, and feared by those that were wicked. The good Seed that he there Sowed doth spring up to this very day, and many yet living can hardly mention him with their Tongues without Tears in their eyes. Nor was there any love lost between them: He would to the last call the People of <hi>Kingston</hi> (As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Phil. 4. 1.) <hi>His Joy and his Crown;</hi> And would often say, <hi>that were it not for some wrangling persons; a Minister might live as comfortable a Life among them, as among any People in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>By his Ministry, as a work of Reformation was wrought upon the Town in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <note place="margin">His success.</note> so also a work of saving Conversion was wrought upon many Souls in perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: Himself in some <hi>Memoires</hi> hath recorded, that in the year 1648. When he was to leave the place, there were thirty Persons that gave him in a paper sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by themselves wherein they owned him for their Spiritual Father; and doubtless there were many thir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>es in and about the Town, who would and could have made the like acknowledgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1635. Came forth the <hi>Book for Sports on the Lords-dayes,</hi> and an <hi>Injunction</hi> requiring that it should be read in every Church, such Ministers as refused to Read it, were for some time <hi>Suspended,</hi> among whom Mr. <hi>Staunton</hi> was one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Saint <hi>Austins</hi> mind, that <hi>it was better to go to Plow, than to Dance on the</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</p>
               <p>During the time of his <hi>Suspension</hi> he took his degree of Doctor in <hi>Divinity</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Doctor.</note> which he did (to use his own words) that he might put the greater honor upon his sufferings. When he Answered in <hi>Comitiis,</hi> and opposed in <hi>Vesperijs,</hi> he was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully Applauded by all that were present. There were several Doctors in the <hi>Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity,</hi> whose fingers did itch to be dealing with him, because he was a Country Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and a <hi>Puritan,</hi> among whom was a Doctor of great note among them, who was so pittyfully <hi>Non-plust</hi> by <hi>Staunton,</hi> that the Auditors hissed at him, and one called out for a Candle that the Doctor might see his Arguments. Of this good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence Doctor <hi>Staunton</hi> himself took thankful notice, giving all the Glory to God,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62667:104"/> and making use of that Scripture, <hi>him that Honours me will I Honour.</hi> At the same time also he Preached in the <hi>Ʋniversity,</hi> upon the Text, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 36. <hi>What will it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit a Man? to gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul:</hi> Of which Sermon he saith, that God did both graciously assist him in the Preaching of it, and wonderfully prospered it when Preach't.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Assembly of Divines</hi> was called at <hi>Westminster,</hi> Dr. <hi>Staunton</hi> was chosen <note place="margin">One of the Assembly.</note> to be one of that Learned and Reverend <hi>Assembly,</hi> and was of good esteem among them, insomuch that he was appointed to be one of the six that kept up that useful, and profitable Lecture every Morning in <hi>Westminster-Abby.</hi> He Preached also se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times before the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and his Sermons were, by their Order, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1648. <hi>Visiters</hi> were appointed for the <hi>Ʋniversity</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged <note place="margin">President of C. C. Colledge.</note> Dr. <hi>Newlin</hi> from his Headship in <hi>C. C. Colledge,</hi> and no Man was thought so fit to succeed him in that place as Dr. <hi>Staunton.</hi> That Colledge had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy in an Eminently Learned and Godly President, the Famous Dr. <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> and now it was blessed again with the Residence and Regency of this worthy Doctor.</p>
               <p>Here he continued above twelve years, in all which time his Deportment, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour <note place="margin">His deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there.</note> was very Exemplary, not only to those that were of his own Colledge, but to the Heads of other Colledges also. Hear what account of his Conversation is given by a faithful Pen of one that was Scholar, and Fellow of that House most of that time when our Doctor was <hi>President</hi> there. Thus he writes,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At his first coming to the Colledge, he put in Execution, and that Vigorously, all such</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His diligence and prudence.</note> Statutes <hi>as tended most to the advancement of Learning, and Religion, and was himself fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently present at all Lectures, and other Exercises, to Encourage the Studious and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Negligent. He set up a Divinity Lecture every</hi> Lords-day, <hi>early in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the Colledge Chappel, for the Initiating, and exercising of the Elder Students in order to fit them for the work of the Ministry. He constantly</hi> Catechized the <hi>Younger sort pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in the Chappel every</hi> Saturday. <hi>He Preached once or twice every</hi> Lords-day, <hi>to the Edification, and comfort of many: Besides his constant course in Saint</hi> Maries, <hi>and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chappel, and several Lectures in Country Towns, whereunto he was alwayes most ready, rather seeking opportunities than declining them. He had every week a meeting in his own Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for Prayer, and Spiritual Conference, as well of the Members of his Colledge, as of others, wherein himself alwayes bore the principal part, bringing out of his store of Experimental knowledge things both New and Old. He was constantly present at Publick Duties of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the Chappel Morning and Evening, observing all, and reproving such as were negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and remiss. He took great care to Introduce, and Elect into the Colledge such as he either saw or heard to have some appearences of Grace; At least, such as were dociable, and inclinable towards that which is good. Spiritual discourse was his meat and drink; And when he sat at Meals in the Colledge Hall, his constant course was, either from the Chapter then Read, or from some occasion or other to speak that which might tend to the Instruction of those that were present, and to call up their minds to some Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1660. Being discharged from the Colledge, where he had been so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <note place="margin">He leaves <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
                  </note> a blessing by his Prudent Government, and Pious Example, both which were so far effectual, that Religion and Learning scarce flourished more in any one Society in that <hi>Ʋniversity,</hi> than in that little <hi>Nursery,</hi> he judged it advisable to withdraw also from that City, in which he had sown so many Handful of precious Seed, which he alwayes well watered with his Tears. For few Preached with more Affection, and less Affectation: But when the time of his departure came, some yet Living know, and well Remember with what sad hearts his dear Friends, Scholars and Citizens, parted with him, as those did with Saint <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20. latter end: <hi>They all wept sore and fell on</hi> Pauls <hi>Neck and kissed him; Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his Face no more, and they accompanied him out of the City.</hi> So did these from the Famous University and City.</p>
               <p>Having left <hi>Oxford</hi> he Recommended himself to Gods Providence to choose a <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Rickmersworth.</hi>
                  </note> fit Habitation for him, where for the present he might six himself, and his first Station was at <hi>Rickmersworth,</hi> a small Market Town in <hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> where he had not been long but he had a very kind welcome from the Gentry, as a Gentleman, and from private Christians, as a Minister of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:62667:105"/>
               <p> His first and principal design, after he had been there a while, was to make way <note place="margin">His prudence and painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> for the Settlement of an able Minister among them, reckoning that one of the best accommodations to an House was wanting, where that was wanting: And he used to say that <hi>Rickmersworth</hi> were a good place if there were better water, meaning a better Ministry; and that his design took no better effect, it was not through any neglect or default of his, having used all means in his power to have brought it to pass: Yet himself quickly found the way to the Pulpit; and because the entrance was narrower than in some other places, he sought out a wider door, and more effectual, and indeed he found out above twenty more in other places, scarce one <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> passed, but he Preached the Gospel of the Kingdome in a new pulpit: And tho he was old and somewhat infirm, yet rarely did he content himself with once, but Preached twice a day.</p>
               <p>Thus this good Man, in labours more abundant than many others, <hi>in the Morning sowed his Seed, and in the Evening witheld not his hand</hi> (so liberal he was of his Spiritual Alms) <hi>not knowing whether should prosper, this or that, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> whether they might not both be alike good (Eccles.</hi> 11. 6.) And like Saint <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi> 15. 19.) from <hi>Rick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersworth,</hi> even round about unto the utmost Borders of the County, yea, in the Neighbouring Counties also, he was willing to be spending, and spent in the service of his great and good Lord and Master <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby we may easily see that our Doctor had not lain idle in the University, till he was rusted and Cankered away, and so fit for no other use in the House of God, but as it was said of <hi>Joseph,</hi> that <hi>his Bow still abode in strength;</hi> So was it with him, his parts memory, and affections still continuing vigorous. Thus he continued constantly Preaching till that black day, <hi>August</hi> 24, 1662. Which impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed silence upon all <hi>Non-Conformists:</hi> Yet neither after this time was he willing to <note place="margin">Fasting and Prayer.</note> be idle: For almost every week he assisted in keeping one day at a private Fast, either in his own, or else in some other Godly Ministers, or Christians Family, as to humble himself for his own sins, so for the sins and abominations which had overspread the Kingdom: And it cannot be easily forgotten with what brakeness of Spirit, and with what a melting Soul he would still take up some hours in those dayes, either in Preaching, or Prayer, or both: For indeed he was mighty in Prayer, as well as in the Scriptures, as its said of <hi>Apollos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus spent about two years, his Wife now labouring under some weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, he gave over House-keeping, and retired into a Chamber or two in a private Family, at some Miles distance, where he was very useful, and quickly Leavened that <note place="margin">He doth good.</note> whole Houshold: His Ministerial gifts and graces were such, as he persumed all with whom he conversed. As long as he continued there, there was a little Church in that House, so that both Governor, Children, and Servants had great cause to bless God for his presence among them, and for his Holy Conference, and exemplary Conversation, which was so profitable unto them.</p>
               <p>From thence he removed to an another private Family (and probably his frequent removes were, that he might have renewed opportunities of doing the more good to men, and the more service to God) where he was entertained as an Angel of God. This Family was near to Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> in which Town he was an Instrument of doing much good, to correct extravagances among some people there, which he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by his sober principles, and great moderation of Spirit, and the Noble exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of self-denyal, and Charity, being no burden to any, <hi>but being crafty, he caught them by guile,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 16.</p>
               <p>His last remove was to a place called <hi>Bovingden,</hi> a little Village, which probably had never been taken notice of, if this eminent Servant of <hi>Christ</hi> had not made his abode, and ended his dayes there. He was brought thither by the Invitation of a very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Noble Gentleman, who freely accommodated him with all the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of an Habitation of his in that place: But our Doctor told a friend of his, that <note place="margin">His Charity.</note> whatsoever he saved that way, he still expended it in Charitable uses, and made Conscience of giving it, either in Mony or Books to poor Families in that, or some Neighbouring places. He distributed several Hundred of <hi>Catechisms,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Baxters Call to the Ʋnconverted</hi> amongst them.</p>
               <p>During this abode here he dayly attended the duties of that Family wherein he lived, instructing those that were therein; and if any of the poor of that place chanced <note place="margin">His frequent Preaching.</note> to come in, he would bid them <hi>welcome,</hi> and say, That Christ came along with them,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62667:105"/> and tell them, <hi>that the poor hath the Gospel Preached unto them.</hi> In this place he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed great privacy: which he greatly prized: And had he been born for himself alone, he could alwaies have chosen to live thus alone. Many worthies in the world have preferred retirement before the greatest preferments in Church or State, and have Judged <hi>Scepters,</hi> and <hi>Myters</hi> not worthy to be compared with it: But he was of another <hi>Spirit,</hi> and could not thus satisfie himself: He had often that saying of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his mouth, <hi>Wo be to me if I Preach not the Gospel.</hi> He was of Reverend Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> mind, <hi>who would not that his Lord should come and find him idle.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he rode often to Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> or to some other adjacent place, and once or twice a year to <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Kingston;</hi> And seeing he could not Preach in a Church to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he contented himself to Preach in a Chamber to a few. 'Tis not the place or multitude that commends our Preaching unto God, many excellent Sermons have been Preached in despicable places and Auditories. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> meeting place in <hi>Macedonia</hi> was by a <hi>Rivers side,</hi> and his Auditors a few of the weaker Sex. Our Saviour himself once Preached a long Sermon to one timerous <hi>Nichodemus (Joh.</hi> 3. 4.) And some other times in the open Air; and to one silly Woman <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
               <p>Thus this Eminent Man of God like a Candle or Torch, with giving light to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <note place="margin">His Sickness.</note> consumed and wasted himself, <hi>July</hi> the eighth, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1671. And of his Age seventy one: He was seized all on one side with the <hi>Dead Palsie,</hi> by reason whereof his Speech much failed him, so that he spake little and seldom. A friend coming to visit him, and asking him how he did? He answered in the words of the Prophet: <hi>In measure God debateth with me, and in the day of the East wind, he stayeth his rough wind:</hi> A while after he said to a Friend that stood by him; I neither fear Death nor desire Life, but am willing to be at Gods disposal. At another time he uttered these words very audibly; <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> and by and by he repeated the fifth verse of the thirty first <hi>Psalm</hi> in <hi>Meeter:</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Into thy Hand Lord I commit</l>
                  <l>My Spirit which is thy due:</l>
                  <l>For why? Thou hast Redeemed it,</l>
                  <l>O Lord my God most true.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>So long as he was able to speak he pressed the By▪standers to many wholesome duties; as, to make sure of Heaven in the time of health: To keep their Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fair and unblotted. To remember, and keep holy the <hi>Sabbath day</hi> (whereof himself was a careful observer.) When he could no longer speak himself he desired others to read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to him, directing them those Portions which he most desired, which were, for the most part, some of <hi>Davids Psalms.</hi> And he was either without any great pain, or without feeling of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> the tenth his Speech was quite taken from him, but yet his understanding and memory continued: About the space of four dayes, he lay (as all about him might perceive) in a very comfortable condition, oft lifting up his Eyes and Hands towards Heaven with a smiling and chearful Countenance. <hi>An upright Life usually ends in a peaceable Death.</hi> A little before his Departure, a Minister Praying <note place="margin">His Death.]</note> with him, he shewed signs of great affections all the while, and Prayer being ended, he took him by the Hand, and held it fast, expressing great signs of Joy in God and of thankfulness unto him. And on the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> this shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light went out, to receive his wages from his great Lord and Master <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was Buried at <hi>Bovenden,</hi> afore-mentioned, <hi>July</hi> the seventeeth, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1671.</p>
               <p>Whilst he lived at <hi>Kingston,</hi> and whas busily employed in begetting Sons and Daughters unto God, God gave him many Sons and Daughters begotten of his own Body, ten of which lie buried in one Grave in the Parish Church of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi> upon whom he hath laid a fair Stone with this <hi>Epitaph</hi> fairly Engraven on it.</p>

               <p>He was very careful and dilligent in the great Duty of <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> which <note place="margin">Self examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Evidences from Heaven.</note> also he often pressed upon others. Concerning which he thus writes.</p>
               <p>Evidences for Heaven, which (if my heart deceive me not) are in me, through the gracious workings of Gods Spirit upon me: They are,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Effectual Calling.</hi> That this is a good Evidence appears from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. The Calling I had was about the year, 1620.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Change of Company:</hi> Choosing the Society of the Godly; shunning the Society of the wicked, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 1. and 26. 4, 5. and 119. 115. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 26. To this my heart answers affirmitively, <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. 1629. And do thou so still, <hi>April.</hi> 3. 1663. And still so, <hi>May</hi> 2. 1666. And again, <hi>April</hi> 2. 1668. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ʋniversality of Obedience, Psa.</hi> 119. 6. and 139. the two last verses. To this my heart answers affirmatively, <hi>Februrary</hi> 4. 1629. And doth so still, <hi>April</hi> 3. 1663.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Love to the Godly as such,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. To this my heart answers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively, <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. 1629. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Sincerity.</hi> Endeavouring to approve my heart more to God, than my wayes to Men: Aiming more at Gods glory, than mine own profit, applause, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. My heart answers affirmitively as before.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Kindly meltings and mournings for sin, upon the sense of Gods free Love in</hi> Christ, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9, 10. My heart answers affirmatively, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Going to <hi>Hemsteed</hi> to Preach, as I was Meditating on the Rode near <hi>Langely,</hi> of the Love of God in Calling such an one as I am, when thousands more Noble, more Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, more Wise and Learned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lye in Ignorance and profaneness, I burst out into a fit of weeping, and my heart by and by was filled with abundance of Joy and rejoyceing.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Zeal for God and against sin, John</hi> 2. 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. My heart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered affirmitively, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>A Love of, and longing for</hi> Christs <hi>appearing:</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17, 20. I cannot say there hath been such a longing in me after <hi>Christs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at least, not so full and frequent, as in many others: yet in Prayer and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the thoughts of a future Estate wherein I should never sin more, but be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with Gods likeness, have been very sweet and comfortable unto me. Once upon the Rode (in a day of my greatest rejoycing as to outward Comforts and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) it Lightned, Thundered, and Rained much. My thoughts were, what if this should be the day of Judgment? What if I should see <hi>Christ</hi> coming presently in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62667:106"/> the Clouds? The answer of my Soul was, <hi>Welcome, Welcome, Welcome:</hi> This filled me with much peace and comfort.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>Speech gracious, or with Grace: Prov.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 29. My heart answers affirmatively, <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. 1629. When I have met with any Ignorant persons willing to be instructed, it hath been my manner (to God be the Glory and praise of it) to set good discourse on foot, and to forward it, when others have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun it.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>Blessing God for, and rejoycing in the gifts and graces of others. Joh.</hi> 29. 30. My heart answers affirmatively, <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. 1629. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho my heart is apt enough (the Lord humble and help me) to envy and detract from others; yet (through mercy) I find.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An heart blessing God for others gifts and graces out-shining mine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Rejoycing that others do greater and better services, and bringing more Glory to him than I do or can.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, <hi>The Spirit of Prayer: Act.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. My heart answers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively, <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. 1629, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Twelfthly, <hi>A careful Sanctification of the Sabbaths Commandments,</hi> 4th. <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 45. and 58. 13, 14. My heart answers affirmatively, <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. 1629, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to the <hi>Psalmists</hi> Counsel and other good Mens custome, he was wont <note place="margin">Meditation.</note> to commune with his heart in the night season, when there is the greatest silence, and least interruption.</p>
               <p>He also kept a <hi>Journal,</hi> or <hi>Diary,</hi> of Gods Mercies: And amongst his many <note place="margin">A Diary of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to him.</note> Collections in this kind, take these few instances which he wrote, and left behind him.</p>
               <p>When being about ten years of Age, I fell sick of a Feaver, and was given up for dead, of mine own accord (I think my good God suggested it) I asked for Butter-milk, which taking, by little and little, my Fever abated, and I reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>When I was about fourteen years old, swinging in a Rope in my Fathers Kitchin at <hi>Birchmore,</hi> which was paved with Freestone, and of an high Roof, which I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to touch with Back and Belly, when I was very high and my Face down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the rope brake, and I fell down flat, and there lay Speechless and as Dead. But anon (the Lord appearing for my help) I brake out into a violent bleeding at Mouth, or Nose, or both; And so by degrees (through the blessing of the Lord) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and recovered.</p>
               <p>Going to Bed in my Tutors Chamber in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and having a Wax-Candle in a Roll by me, burning on a Deal-box full of Linnen, I fell asleep: The Box and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen were burnt, but the Bed not touched, tho close to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I was Minister at <hi>Kingston,</hi> I drank Ink one Morning instead of Muskadine, yet had no hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April 8th.</hi> 1659. at <hi>Oxford,</hi> my Wife being in her Closset very late, which was hung with much Linnen round about, and I in Bed and a sleep in the Chamber ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, the Candle taking hold on the Linnen, set it on fire, which flamed round about her: She (the Lord assisting of her) bestirred her self, pulled down the Linnen, trod it under foot, and mastered the fire. I was not waked, nor she much damaged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 1. 1666. At the <hi>Bell-Inn</hi> in <hi>Aldersgate-street, London,</hi> between eight and nine a Clock at night, missing my way to my Chamber, I went upon the Leads unrailed, pitching my Staff before me; I went so nigh the <hi>Precipice,</hi> or downfall into the yard, that I found no footing for my staff: But a step between me and death! O what shall I render, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another commendable excellency in this Holy Man was his Laboriousness in the <note place="margin">Preaching frequent.</note> work of the Ministry. Somthing of this you had before. His great care was <hi>to fulfil the Ministry which he had received of the Lord,</hi> his heart was in this work: He did <hi>Hoc agere:</hi> This was his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It was his <hi>Meet and Drink.</hi> He would often say, that he feared to hear that rebuke from <hi>Christ</hi> another day. <hi>Thou evil and sloathful Servant, Mat.</hi> 25. 26. Wicked because sloathful. When he came to visit his Friends, if they did not ask, to be sure he would offer his pains among them. What? He would say, is there no work for a Preacher here? But tho his Sermons were sometimes offered, they were never ordinary ware.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:62667:107"/>
               <p> He never offered to God, in that way, that which cost him nothing. He alwayes <note place="margin">His Preaching.</note> disliked immethodical and indigested Preaching: Indeed he was a <hi>work-man that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be ashamed</hi> of his work, and yet he was as great an Enemy to quaint, as he was to Crude Preaching: Next to painfulness, he liked plainness in a Preacher, which two are not inconsistent. Ministers are termed <hi>Gods Interpreters,</hi> yet many times their Sermons are such, that they need others to be their Interpreters. It was a saying of Holy Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> that many of our <hi>English</hi> Preachers shoot over the Head of most of their hearers. They are not alwayes low in Learning that stoop to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of their <hi>Auditors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Life of Preaching lies in Application; And in this indeed he was alwaies most vigorous and lively. In his admonitions and Exhortations he was so affectionate, that he would impart, <hi>not the Gospel only, but his very Soul</hi> also to his <hi>Auditory.</hi> He was called <hi>the searching Preacher.</hi> In every Sermon he would still speak something by way of Trial, and Examination: He would frequently have his Marks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction betwixt the <hi>precious and the vile;</hi> the <hi>sincere</hi> Person and the <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> This story he Recorded himself, that having a suspicion of one Man in his Parish, who made a great Profession of Religion, of whom he often thought in his distinctions, that very Person came afterwards to him, saying, <hi>You will never leave Distinguishing, till you have distinguished me into Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Staunton</hi> Preaching once at <hi>Warborough,</hi> not far from <hi>Oxford,</hi> one in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation <note place="margin">Providence remarkable.</note> was so affected with his first Prayer, that he ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to his House (which was near) and bad his Wife to make her self ready and come to Church; for there was one in the Pulpit that prayed like an Angel, so as he never heard the like. The Woman hasted to Church with her Husband, and God so ordered it, that that Sermon proved effectual for her Conversion, and she proved afterwards a serious and eminent Christian.</p>
               <p>He was familliarly acquainted with the Holy Scriptures of the <hi>Old and New-Testament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scriptures studied.</note> and (as <hi>Apollos)</hi> was mighty therein. His head was instead of a <hi>Concordance:</hi> It was a wonder to see how readily he could turn to any Text upon all occasions. He greatly loved the Word, and therefore could not easily forget it. He loved it more than the Bride doth her Ornaments, which run in her mind continually. The <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of God were his delight and the Men of his Counsel,</hi> he read and <hi>meditated therein day and night.</hi> Where ever he went he carried the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> or <hi>Davids Psalms</hi> along with him. The first thing he did in a Morning was to Read a Portion of the Sacred Scripture, which Ministred matter of Meditation, and of Communication all the day after.</p>
               <p>When he was to seek for matter of good discourse (which was very seldome) or <note place="margin">Conference.</note> when no fit occasion was offered otherwise, then would he speak of some Scripture that he had read that Morning, from which he would raise some useful observations, or propose some Practical Questions to the Edification of the hearer. At Night when he went to Bed, he would search out some Scripture or other which suited with his present thoughts, and that was the subject matter of his Meditation in his waking hours. He seldom wrote any Letter but he added three, or four, or more Scriptures for a <hi>Post-script,</hi> and those very pertinent, either to the present occasion of his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or to the condition of the Person to whom he wrote: Or haply they should respect the times, and the Providences of God therein. He seldome visited, or met any Friend, but he would at parting, leave some Scripture or other with him. Pray you (he would say) let me leave one Text of Scripture with you, and think of it when I am gone.</p>
               <p>He was very frequent and servent in Prayer. What <hi>David</hi> said of himself may be <note place="margin">Prayer fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</note> truly affirmed of him, <hi>I gave my self to Prayer.</hi> Its Recorded of <hi>Luther,</hi> that no day passed over him wherein he did not spend three hours at least in this duty, and it may be truly said of our Doctor, that he <hi>restrained not Prayer;</hi> not slightly passed it over. He was <hi>fervent in Spirit, thus serving the Lord:</hi> his manner was, when ever he came to Lodge at any Friends House, after he had saluted those that were present, he would presently retire into his Chamber; where he would spend about an hour by himself, before any Friend could speak with him: At Night also he would again be shut up in his Chamber for a considerable time before any Servant could be admitted to him He would often say to his Godly Friends that came to visit him; <hi>Come must we not pray together before we part?</hi> Indeed it may be said of him, what was said of another,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62667:107"/>
                  <hi>Mihi cibus &amp; potus est Oratio:</hi> Prayer was his best repast, his meat, and his drink. Nor did he slubber over this duty as too many do, but he did it with all his might: He prayed in Prayer: He wrestled with God as <hi>Jacob</hi> did: He usually wept when he made his supplications unto God, he was not only affectionate when he prayed with others, but when he was alone by himself: This himself hath recorded, <hi>the glory be God were; I have shed one tear in Prayer with others, I have (I think I speak within compass) shed two in secret between God and mine own Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Prayer alone, or with others, if he could have room, he would perform the <note place="margin">Humility in Prayer.</note> duty kneeling on the ground; Yea, tho he was sometimes almost lost in the Crowd by so doing. He used to say, that <hi>the humblest Gesture, as well as the humblest Spirit best became the duty of Prayer:</hi> And that he knew no way of wrestling with the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, like that <hi>of lying at his feet, and prostrating our selves before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a strict observer of the <hi>Lords-day.</hi> Some have observed, that the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <note place="margin">Sabbaths sanctified.</note> of it is one of the first things that a Converted Person makes Conscience of. This good Man was every day watchful over his thoughts, words and actions, but more especially upon the <hi>Lords-dayes.</hi> It was rare to hear him speak one idle word, or see him do one unnecessary action on those dayes. His strictness was such herein, that some have wondered at it; and some (too hastily perhaps) have censured him for it. He went from duty to duty (as Bees do, from flower to flower) from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick duties to Family Duties; from Family duties to Closet duties, finding sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them all. He would say, <hi>we must alwayes be good Husbands of time, especially of Holy time. We must not spend that time which is not our own, about our own affairs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He kept many private fasts alone, and with his Family. This he did ordinarily <note place="margin">Fasting and prayer.</note> before he came to the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> and at other times when he found any Corruption to grow or get head in his heart. There are some Devils, and Devillish Lusts, that will not be cast out, or kept under by other means. This he himself Records, that when he was a young Preacher, he found himself to be very prone to be puffed up and exalted (its observed, that Spiritual pride is the special sin of young Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) whereupon he set a day apart to seek to God for strength against that sin, and from that day forward he felt (as himself expresses it) that the neck and heart of <note place="margin">Pride subdued.</note> it was broken.</p>
               <p>He was a most lowly minded Christian: He was Clothed all over with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <note place="margin">His Humility.</note> Garment of <hi>Humility,</hi> that Treasury of grace, that Ornament of Religion. Neither his Parentage nor his parts, nor his applause, nor any thing else, did (to appearance) any way elate, or puff him up. Tho he was lifted up in the eyes and hearts of others, yet was he lowly in his own. It was usual with him to esteem others, that were far inferiour to him, to be better than himself.</p>
               <p>He was very Charitable <hi>unto all, especially to those of the Houshold of Faith.</hi> 'Tis <note place="margin">His Charity.</note>
                  <hi>Davids</hi> Character of a good Man, <hi>that he giveth to the poor, and disperses Liberally, Psa.</hi> 112. 5, 9. And this was his practice; whilst others were for gathering and heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, he was for dispersing and scattering abroad. As all graces were conspicuous in him, so this of Charity in a special manner, which is the only Grace (saith one) wherein God and Man Communicates. He <hi>devised Liberal things,</hi> and drew out, not his Sheafe only, but <hi>his Soul to the hungry (Isa.</hi> 58. 10.) He did not draw out his Purse only to relieve them, but his Bowels and Soul to pity them.</p>
               <q>Dat benè, dat multum qui dat cum Munere Vultum.</q>
               <p>His manner was, when he rode abroad to put so much Mony into his Pocket, as he could well spare for this purpose; And as he met with any Indigent person, he would fall into discourse with him; and if he found any knowledge of God or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Godliness, he would the more plentifully relieve them; Nor should the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant (if he judged them necessitous and not idle) part from him without some Counsel and relief. For Purse Alms, and Spiritual Almes together, very few were his equals. He used often to visit poor and needy Families, or call in, as he passed by them, and would ever leave something behind him for the good both of their Souls and bodies. God lent him a compitent Estate, (and which is better) gave him an heart to lend it back to him again. God Honoured him, and he again Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured God with his substance.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:62667:108"/>
               <p> He was very eminent for Patience. Those that knew his circumstances, and his Lamb-like carriage under them, will readily confess that he was one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <note place="margin">His Patience.</note> patterns of Patience that this Age hath produced. Among the various tryals wherewith he was exercised, he had one which was not ordinary, his Wife fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a <hi>Distraction;</hi> Yet whoever saw him out of humor? Whoever heard him grumble, or speak a repining word for it? Yea, many that knew it have admired, not only at his patience, but at chearfulness under so sad a dispensation. He had learned that great Lesson, <hi>in every thing give thanks:</hi> It may be said of him as of that great Apostle Saint <hi>Paul, that he was Joyful, yea, exceeding Joyfull in all his Tribulations.</hi> His Conversation was made up of seriousness, tempered with chearfulness, how grave was he in all Company, and yet how chearful? I used my self (saith he) to be somewhat merry and chearful in Company, that standers by might for that reason be the more in Love with Religion, to shew that it was not inconsistent with harmless Mirth, and (through mercy) I have cause to think that I have sometimes attained that end. I have hereby drawn some to a liking of the good wayes of God.</p>
               <p>He much disliked, and lamented the unnatural heats and divisions that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">His peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Christians. He was not <hi>Sceptical,</hi> and indifferent, nor yet rigid and morose: He seemed to tread in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> steps, and did alwayes endeavour to accommodate himself, to those that differed from him so far as lawfully he might, and as his Love of truth would permit. Many Men prefer a petty <hi>Notion</hi> to the Churches peace and Communion, and are so capricious and over-confident of their own determinations, that they will hold no Communion, nay hardly have a pleasing Conversation with those who are not of their perswasion: But our Doctor was of another <hi>Alloy,</hi> and of a more excellent temper. He used to say, <hi>that all men must have their grains of allowance.</hi> The most knowing Christians know but in part. He would Familiarly converse (yea, and if occasion was, Communicate in all Ordinances) with those that held the head, and were found in the vitals of Christian Religion, tho in other things they were er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. This he much declaimed against, that Christians upon every little occasion, made nothing of separation. If they disliked a People, the next word was, we will joyn with them no longer: If they disliked a Preacher, presently we will hear him no more. His opinion was, that it will never be well with the Church of God in this Nation, so long as Christians are so prone to division and separation. This, this is <hi>Englands</hi> incurable wound.</p>
               <p>What was said of <hi>David</hi> and of our Lord <hi>Christ</hi> himself may be truly affirmed of <note place="margin">His zeal.</note> this worthy Doctor, <hi>The Zeal of God did consume and eat him up.</hi> Tho he seldome sinned in being angry, yet he often, yea very often was angry with sin. He could bear to be reproached and evil-spoken of himself, but not that God and his Name should be Blasphemed, and dishonored. Among other instances take one or two that are set down under his own hand.</p>
               <p>Being once (saith he) at a Wedding Dinner, at the Marriage of one of Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentines</hi> Servant, I observed a Fidler to Swear, and to Sing very obscenely, at which I was troubled, and filled with Indignation, till anon I called to him to forbear, and gave him Mony to hold his peace, tendring therein the Glory of God, and was much comforted thereby.</p>
               <p>Supping once at an Inn betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> where many who travelled together did also eat together, one among the rest was full of vain, and profane dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. I applyed my self unto him, and labored to convince him of the evil of sin, and of the curse and wrath of God which hung over his head: And then I told him also of the riches of Gods Grace to repenting sinners, of his readiness to receive them, and to be reconciled unto them. This made him more mute, but what farther op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration it had upon him, I know not; only this was remarkable, that the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Providences special.</note> of the grace of God in the Gospel, fell upon a young Schollar that stood by, and (as he afterwards confest) it melted his very heart, and helpt him from under a Spirit of Bondage, wherewith he had been bowed down, and broken, for many Moneths past.</p>
               <p>Another demonstration of his great zeal for God, was his frequent projecting and <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> contriving how he might promote his Honour and Service in the world. He hath been ofeen heard to say to his Friends in a Morning; <hi>Come Friends, what shall we do for God this day? How shall we Trade with our Talents for the furtherance of his Glory?</hi> Never did that Ambitious Man Study and strive for the advancing of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62667:108"/> himself as he did for advancing the Name and Honor of his God.</p>
               <p>He took much delight in, and excelled in Christian Conference, for which he <note place="margin">Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> deserves to be Recorded to all Posterity. If he came behind some for Learning, Elocution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet he went before them in this Grace and gift. As Men have their perticular sins, so they have their perticular Graces and Excellencies: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> excelled in Faith; <hi>Moses</hi> in Meekness; <hi>Joh</hi> in Patience, and our worthy Doctor in Holy and Godly <hi>Conference.</hi> Whoever conversed with him, and was not a gainer by his Heavenly discourse? His Speech was <hi>alwayes with Grace,</hi> which as it argued grace in the speaker, so it was apt to work, or stir up Grace in the hearers, it was ever <hi>savoury, seasoned with salt,</hi> and good to the <hi>use of Edifying, Ephe,</hi> 4. 29. His heart was alwayes <hi>inditing a good matter,</hi> and therefore his tongue was as the <hi>Pen of a ready Writer, Psa.</hi> 45. 1, 2. <hi>His Lips fed many, Prov.</hi> 10. 21. They alwayes <hi>dropped as the Hony comb (Cant.</hi> 4. 11.) <hi>Grace was poured into them,</hi> and it flowed plentifully from them. He had a good stock, and Rich Treasure in his heart, and from thence (upon every occasion) he brought forth <hi>things both New and Old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many have admired his skill and dexterity this way, who will never be able to imitate it. It was a wonder (when he sat at Meat with his Friends) how readily he would turn their water into wine, their merry and Idle into serious and profitable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. When any were talking of their worldly and secular affairs, he had a faculty of scruing in some heavenly Argument, which also he did so handsomely, that the most Ignorant, or Carnal person among them could not be offended at it.</p>
               <p>Those that would nauseate such discourse from others, would yet accept it from him, so handsomely and artificially did he manage it. He had an excellent faculty <note place="margin">Discourse.</note> in <hi>warning the unruly, and in comforting the feeble minded:</hi> But he was wondrous ready in instructing the Ignorant, even such as others would slight, not thinking them worthy of their pains, by reason of their meanness and Ignorance: He delighted in conversing with such, and instrucing of them; and would say, their Souls are as precious as the Souls of Nobles.</p>
               <p>When accidentally he met with any person (tho a stranger) as he was sitting in a House, or walking abroad, or riding by the way, he would instantly apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to him, and fall into discourse with him. Not long before his Death, coming to a Gentlemans House, and sitting down, he presently asked the Servant that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, what Country-man he was? And where he was born? To which the young Man no sooner replyed, but his next Question was, <hi>I pray thee tell me: Dost thou think thou art born again?</hi> And by this Introduction he took occasion (as our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> did to <hi>Nichodemus)</hi> to open to him the nature and necessity of the <hi>New-Birth.</hi> And his success in this way was somewhat answerable to his diligence, some having been Converted, and many others instructed, Comforted, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by his Godly and savoury discourse.</p>
               <p>His Modesty and Humility was such, that he never judged any of his Labors wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <note place="margin">His modesty.</note> of the Press; yet he consented that his <hi>Treatise about Christian Conference</hi> should be Printed, which, tho a plain, yet a profitable discourse.</p>
               <p>Thus you have one of the fairest Copies that this Age hath produced, presented to your view. A Man that was (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Titus</hi> to be) <hi>a pattern of good works:</hi> One that in <hi>Doctrine shewed uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech that could not be Condemned:</hi> One that in Conversion shewed integrity, unblamable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and good works that ought to be imitated. A few more such Ministers and Christians, would convince or condemn the ungodly Generation among whom we live, and make them of another mind who say and think, <hi>that all Professors are but pretenders to Religion;</hi> and that there is no such thing as Grace and Godliness, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from Moral Virtue and Righteousness: There is not a more ready way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute and refel such Calumnies, than to refer them to the Conversation of such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; as <hi>Diogenes</hi> confuted one which denyed that there was any motion, by geting up and walking before his eyes.</p>

                     <hi>Of Dr.</hi> Stauntons <hi>great care to promote Religion and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in</hi> C. C. C. <hi>whilst he was President, by Mr.</hi> J. M. <hi>Sometime Fellow of the same.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I (Saith he) who had the happiness to be near him for many years, and observed the excellent workings of the Grace of God in him, cannot but speak of the things which I have seen and heard.</p>
                  <p>In his younger years he was chosen Scholar of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and not long after <hi>Probationer Fellow</hi> of the same, before he was <hi>Batchellor of Arts;</hi> a thing seldome known in that House. There Men finding him to be not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, but ingenuous also, shewed him great respect, bestowing one token thereof after another. And there God not for any desert in him, but out of his own mercy and grace did set his eye upon him: There did the kindness and love of God (which a great while before had run, like water, under ground) break forth and appear; saving him by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>For here God first opened his eyes, and caused him to see his wretched condition, which did greatly and deeply humble him, and made him to put up <hi>strong cries, with tears, to him tbat was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared, (Heb.</hi> 5. 7.) For at length he had his Conscience sprinkled with the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> by whom he received <hi>the Atonement.</hi> And <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life in</hi> Christ Jesus, <hi>made him free from the Law of sin and death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now he became a member of the most Ancient, Honourable, and durable Society in the world: Being, first chosen, and then admitted Fellow of <hi>Sion Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> where an innumerable Company of Saints and Angels where his Collegues. And having received his Grace, he found himself strongly inclined to make others pertakers of the same. Wherefore, having taken his Degree of <hi>Master of Arts,</hi> after some few years he left the Colledge, and gave up himself to the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</p>
                  <p>He spent most of his time and labors at <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> where the <hi>pleasure of the Lord did prosper in his hands.</hi> From thence (as we heard before) he was
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62667:109"/> called to be a Governor of that Colledge whereof before he had been a Member: And as soon as he came to the place he manifested an earnest desire after the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Society in every respect, exciting, and by his Example, leading such as were to assist him, to endeavour the same.</p>
                  <p>His Government favoured more of lenity and mildness than of sharpness and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity; yet he kept the Colledge in very good order and discipline. And tho the House, before his time, had been much troubled with division, he, by his Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Christian prudence, kept them all of a peice, and in the enjoyment of great Peace and Concord. He was indeed naturally of an exceeding good temper and disposition; gentle, affable, and courteous to all, which being embellished with Grace, made him exceeding amiable, and very useful in his whole Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>His great care was to promote Religion and Learning in the Colledge, which he prosecuted with both hands earnestly. <hi>Divine knowledge and humane learning are the right and left Eye of the world: And as the Sun and Moon are to the Ʋniverse, the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of either of them leaves the World in darkness.</hi> One thing there was which made him more desirous to see Religion and Learning to meet together in conjunction, in all such as were to be chosen Scholars of the House, or if that could not be obtained, to have them joyned together afterwards. It was the Founders Will, expressed in one of his Statutes, that all the Fellows, and Scholars that were of the Foundation, should, about a year or two after they were <hi>Masters of Arts,</hi> be ordained to the Holy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry; one only excepted, who <hi>ad Arbitrium,</hi> might be deputed to the study and Practice of <hi>Physick Parts and Learning without grace, make a Man capable of doing very good Service in the Common-wealth; but both in Conjunction are more requisite in one who is to make manifest the savour of the knowledge of</hi> Christ <hi>in every place,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up, but Charity Edifies,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>A Man of Learning without Grace, is like a Ship without Ballast, the least blast of applause is ready to drive him upon the Quick-sands of pride, or to carry him upon the Rocks of opposition to others, yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the truth it self, and that to his own great danger and the prejudice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon such accounts as these, this Godly wise Man was careful to prevent (if it might be) an error in the first concoction, knowing how hard it might be to prevent it in the second. Therefore when any Scholars place became void, if there appeared many <hi>Candidates</hi> for it, he appointed them, sometime before the Election, to attend him at his Lodgings, where he examined them privately, and set down in a Paper the Age, Standing, and Proficiency in Learning, of every one of them. He noted also what Testimonials he had received from Persons of Integrity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the good Conversation of any of them, and of their hopefulness as to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, together with his own apprehensions of them, upon his Examination as to that matter also.</p>
                  <p>And if such a number of the Electors as was requisite, could not (after publick Examination) agree upon one of them, he upon whom the Election was in that Case devolved, if there appeared to him and Equallity, or near an equallity in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respects, he would alwayes let piety have the Honour to turn the Scales.</p>
                  <p>His next care was to have these Twins, Piety and Parts fostered and cherished, and by all wayes and means, improved, and heighthened to the utmost of his Power: And to this purpose he came alwayes to all <hi>Colledge Exercises:</hi> Held every one to the Duties of their several Places, and observed every ones growth, and progress in Learning, by which means he was the better able to Judge whom to prefer when any of them came to be Competitors for a Fellowship.</p>
                  <p>His care was no less to see Religion prosper and thrive: For which end he made choise of the fittest Persons that he could find to perform the Duty of Prayer, Morning and Evening; even such as would with Reverence, seriousness, and warm affections, engage the hearts of the Hearers in the Duty: And at this holy exercise himself was present as constantly, if not more constantly than the younger Scholars, as to joyn in the Duty, to bring down a blessing upon them from above, and upon their Studies, so also to see that it was performed Reverently, and to see that the whole Society came together duly.</p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Lords-day</hi> in the Evening when the whole House met together to offer up their <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> he examined the younger sort; calling them to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62667:110"/> an account of what they heard that day; which was a likely means to engage them to the greater attention in hearing, and to make the truths, by their pondering upon them, to sink the deeper into their hearts.</p>
                  <p>He took great pains to instruct them of the lower Rank in the Grounds of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, calling them one day in the week into the Chappel, where he opened the great and weighty truths of Christianity to them: Endeavouring still, not only to inform their Judgments, but to make the truths reach their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Founder required, that the Fellows and Scholars should, at such a standing (as was said before) be Ordained to the Ministry; he, with the consent of such of the Fellows, as were impowered by the Statutes to make <hi>Orders</hi> for the good of the Society, decreed, that all of such a standing or above, should Preach every <hi>Lords-day</hi> in the Morning, by course, in the Colledge Chappel, before the Publick Sermon in the University. By this means they which were designed for the work of the Ministry, might hereby both prove, and improve, and also approve themselves to others to be Men <hi>Apt to teach;</hi> which is one of the quallifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the <hi>Apostolical Canons</hi> in them that are to be called to the Pastoral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>Lastly besides the Conferences which he had often in his own Lodgings about Soul concernments, and Communion in the <hi>Lords-Supper</hi> in the Colledge Chappel, where he himself did administer, and many of the House with others from abroad were pertakers of that Sacred Ordinance: He would be often discoursing with such of the Society as came to him about any business, and that in such a manner as tended to the promoting of Holiness. For he seldome would let them part from him without some Instruction, Admonition, or hearty Counsel.</p>
                  <p>Those especial, who by reason of their place and standing, were most frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, received great benefit by their Conversing with him. For his <hi>Heart taught his Mouth and added Learning to his Lips.</hi> When a Portion of Scripture was read at Dinner (as usually it was) he did not only cause deep silence, and reverent Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through all the Hall, that all, while they were feeding their Bodies, might feed their Souls also. But when the Chapter was ended, if there were any difficult places in it, he either propounded them to the Fellows that sat at Table with him, or else opened and unfolded them himself. If it contained <hi>Practical</hi> matter, it was a profitable, and pleasant thing to see and hear, how he, who applyed his Heart to the knowledge of God, and kept his words and Laws within him, had them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fitted in his Lips.</p>
                  <p>He lived to see some fruit of his Labors to his great joy and contentment. For divers of them who were, from the beginning, trained up under him, became Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wel-disposed and Pious Men; among whom was Mr. <hi>Joseph Allein,</hi> late Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Gospel at <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>Sommerset▪shire.</hi> For as he was a great Comfort to this Holy Man whilst he was in the Colledge, so it did revive him to hear (for he was often enquiring after such as had been under him, as a Father after his Children) that he proved so eminently Pious, and useful a Man in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>We have seen how vigilant and indusirious a Governor this good Man was in <note place="margin">His care of Souls.</note> the Colledge: He was also one who in Compassion to Mens Souls, took every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, when he was at home to Preach in, or near to the City of <hi>Oxford.</hi> One of the Impropriations belonging to the Colledge, having (before his time) but a small stipend belonging to it; not sufficient to afford a subsistance to an able Man to labor, and watch over the People for the good of their Souls, he first went himself, and afterwards he desired some of the <hi>Senior Fellows</hi> to go thither by course, and Preach unto the People: Which desire of his they readily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embraced for some time, till the Lease of the Impropriation came to be renewed: At which time, upon his proposal, the Fellows consented either much to abate, or wholly to remit the Fine, in leiu thereof requiring a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Sum to be paid yearly, to encourage an able Man to labor constantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
                  <p>When the Affairs of the Colledge called him forth into Places remote from the University, he was alwayes ready to take any opportunity of doing good to the Souls of Men. One who hath rode many Hundred Miles in Company with him, hath alwayes observed his deportment in all places, and towards all persons, to be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62667:110"/> such as became an Heavenly minded Christian, and a true and faithful Minister of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was riding on the way, he entertained his Company with Heavenly discourse: And as variety of objects did present themselves to him, <note place="margin">His heavenly-mindedness.</note> he alwayes drew excellent matter out of them; glorifying God for the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Goodness which appeared in the works of Creation, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>When he passed by such as were about their occasions in the Feilds, he would <note place="margin">His prudence.</note> many times make an <hi>Alt,</hi> and enter into a short discourse with them. He used first to ask them some ordinary Questions, such as Travellers use to do, and then to take occasion from their answers, to propound other Questions of weight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to their Souls: leaving alwaies some serious word with them at parting, for them to Ruminate upon when he was gone. And probably there are many, who never saw his face, nor he theirs, but thus in his passage, that have blest God for him.</p>
                  <p>When he came to his Lodging, either in a publick or Private House, as he had a better advantage there, so he constantly made use of it, for Gods glory, and the <note place="margin">Holy discourse.</note> Edification of whatsoever Company Gods Providence cast him. He had an excellent Gift and rare faculty to improve discourse so as to make it, not only pleasant to those with whom he did converse, but very profitable to their Souls, still aiming at the last, as that mark which he had constantly in his eye.</p>
                  <p>When he came among persons of Quality (being himself well born, well <note place="margin">His prudence</note> Educated, of a Generous Spirit, and a chearful temper) his Company, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse was usually very grateful to them, which gave him an advantage to tell them (as he would plainly, yet prudently) of what he saw amiss in them: To mind them of the Vanity of the World: Of better things above; and to put them (as he often would) upon good designes to shew their Thankfulness to God for his Mercy and Goodness to them.</p>
                  <p>Nor was there a person so mean, but he would readily and humbly condescend to him, as knowing what precious Souls dwell in the poorest Houses of clay. He alwaies spake to such in their own <hi>Dialect,</hi> and in such a <hi>Phrase</hi> as they well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; trying their knowledge and feeling the <hi>Pulse</hi> of their Souls. If he found them ignorant, or insensible of their Spiritual Estate, he would endeavour to awaken them by laying plain Texts of Scripture before them, for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>
                  <p>If he met with humbled, and burdened Souls, or such as were Babes in <hi>Christ,</hi> he would gather and embrace them as Lambs in his Arms, and gently lead them to the <hi>Wells of Salvation.</hi> If at any time there happened to be a mixt Company at the Table with him; some serious Christians, some Professors at large, his manner was to be very free and pleasant in Discourse with them, which caused them all to give great attention to him: Then might you have seen how ever and anon the Hony dropped from his Lips while the Company were hanging on them. How skilful he was in dividing the <hi>Word of Truth aright,</hi> giving to every one his Portion, and how wise in winning of Souls.</p>
                  <p>If he observed any to take the boldness from his innocent Mirth and pleasant humour, to incline to vain and frothy discourse, he would very dexterously turn to some more profitable matter, and (as occasion was given) afford a serious reproof, tempered with much kindness and Love to their Souls, which was usually well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at his hand.</p>
                  <p>If his occasions required his stay a day or two at any place, he seldom departed before he had Preached to the people: And he found by much and long Experience
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62667:111"/> that a plain way of Preaching was the most effectual to the ends for which that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance was appointed, and therefore he constantly used it, even in the Colledge and University, tho he could easily have appeared in an other strain, had he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred an Airy Reputation with some, before the work of his Master, and the real advantage of his hearers.</p>

               <p>THis Reverend and Learned Divine, Mr. <hi>Samuel Fairclough,</hi> was born <hi>April</hi> 29. 1594. at <hi>Haverill,</hi> an ancient Market Town in that part of <note place="margin">His Birth.</note>
                  <hi>Suffolk</hi> which borders both upon <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Cambridge-shire;</hi> His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Lawrence Fairclough,</hi> was a branch of that <hi>very ancient</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> from whence he was sent to the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and thence removed to be Incumbent at <hi>Haverill,</hi> where he lived an <hi>able</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> Preacher of the Gospel for many years. His Mother was Mrs. <hi>Many Cole,</hi> the Daughter of Mr. <hi>John Cole,</hi> chief Lord of that Town: so that he was well descended both by Father and Mother, and to be born <hi>so,</hi> is reckoned an honour even by <hi>divine</hi> testimony <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>filii illustrium,</hi> the children of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Parents, having a preference given them in sacred Writ, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 17.</p>
               <p>This Family hath been very famous for Arts and Arms; one of this mans <hi>Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Peacham</hi> tells us in his Book of Heraldry, was Standard-bearer to the <hi>Earl</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Family.</note>
                  <hi>of Darby</hi> at <hi>Bosworth-field,</hi> who under God was a great means whereby <hi>Henry the 7th</hi> obtained the Victory over <hi>Richard the third,</hi> an Usurper, whereby those <hi>civil</hi> Wars ended, with <hi>which</hi> this Nation was before <hi>almost</hi> ruined. Another of his Family for his great Learning and Skill in the <hi>Oriental</hi> Languages, as Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> tells us in his <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> History, was appointed by Commission from <hi>King James,</hi> to be one of the new <hi>Translators</hi> of the <hi>Bible;</hi> a work of great use and benefit to the <hi>Church</hi> of God. Dr. <hi>Daniel Fairclough, alias Featley,</hi> was a branch of this Family also, <hi>whose works do, and will always praise him in the Gates;</hi> But none hath <hi>heightened</hi> the reputation of <hi>this name</hi> more than <hi>this Gentleman,</hi> of whose Life we shall now give some account.</p>
               <p>He was the <hi>youngest Son</hi> and the youngest <hi>Child</hi> (save one) of his Father, all his <note place="margin">His Brethren and Sisters.</note>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi> who were four, were men of such <hi>great Spirits,</hi> as that so soon as they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Age of 20 or 21 years, they all <hi>travelled</hi> beyond Sea, and some of them
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62667:112"/> took <hi>Commissions</hi> to serve in the Wars of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> where they did very eminent Service, and <hi>all</hi> of them but <hi>one</hi> (who returned and dyed <hi>a Batchelour of Eighty years old</hi> in <hi>England)</hi> dyed in the Wars, and <hi>slept</hi> in the <hi>Bed</hi> of <hi>Honour.</hi> He had <hi>four Sisters,</hi> all very <hi>gracious</hi> Women, and all married to <hi>pious</hi> Husbands.</p>
               <p>His good Father having preached a Sermon of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> for the coming in <note place="margin">His Fathers death.</note> of <hi>King James,</hi> in the year 1603. caught so great a <hi>cold</hi> by it, that he dyed the <hi>next</hi> day, leaving <hi>this</hi> Son then but <hi>nine years old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From a child he was of a most <hi>ingenuous</hi> and <hi>ingenious</hi> temper; what the <hi>Greeks</hi>

                  </gap>, good nature, or what the <hi>Latines</hi> call <hi>Ingenium, quasi ingenitum,</hi> inbred <hi>connate</hi> worth, was early discerned to be in him, and gave <hi>strong</hi> hopes of his being a <hi>brave</hi> person in <hi>due time:</hi> No man did ever arrive to any <hi>excellency,</hi> unless <hi>nature</hi> had first laid a good <hi>foundation</hi> for Art and Industry afterwards to build upon. There must be some <hi>naturales igniculi,</hi> some sparks of a generous Life <hi>hid</hi> and <hi>laid up</hi> by nature, which are to be <hi>blown</hi> up by Art; or as <hi>Plato</hi> expresses them, <hi>quaedam semina virtutum,</hi> some seeds of virtue, which <hi>education</hi> must <hi>cultivate</hi> and well <hi>water,</hi> or else no <hi>great</hi> things can be <hi>expected</hi> from any man.</p>
               <p>There were <hi>many</hi> pledges of a great and good <hi>mind,</hi> discerned in this Child when <note place="margin">His Love of Learning, and being put to School.</note> very young; which his <hi>Father</hi> perceived; but more <hi>especially</hi> he observed in him a natural <hi>bookishness,</hi> and a desire to study, and a love to <hi>search</hi> after knowledge. The <hi>Philosopher</hi> advises Parents to follow those <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; those <hi>propensions</hi> of their Childrens tempers; and accordingly his Father upon his <hi>death-bed</hi> laid a particular command on his <hi>Mother</hi> to breed this Son a <hi>Scholar,</hi> and advised, that he should be put to School, and educated under one Mr. <hi>Robotham,</hi> the most famous School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master of that age. His Master <hi>soon</hi> found him to be a Lad of very <hi>great parts,</hi> and moreover, (which is not ordinarily found in Children of <hi>quick Wits)</hi> he was very <hi>sedulous</hi> and <hi>industrious;</hi> By these <hi>advantages</hi> it came to pass, that before he was <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> years of Age he was sent to the <hi>Ʋniversity,</hi> with this Testimony from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, That he was the best <hi>Scholar</hi> that ever went from that School, whereof he had been <hi>Master</hi> near 30 years.</p>
               <p>This could not but be a <hi>great comfort</hi> to his Mother; but there was <hi>something</hi> of <note place="margin">A work of God upon his Conscience, at 13 years of age.</note> another kind, which <hi>rejoiced</hi> her much more; and it was this, that <hi>God</hi> was pleased to begin a <hi>work of grace</hi> in his heart very early and betimes, by <hi>awakening</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science by the terrours of the Law, and by <hi>bestowing</hi> a sincere repentance upon him thereby, and by working an effectual faith in him; and all this done by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the word preached by Mr. <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> then Lecturer of <hi>Haverill:</hi> Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> had <hi>answered for him in his Baptism,</hi> and had always an hearty love to him; who Preaching one Lords day upon <hi>Zacheus his conversion▪</hi> and discoursing upon <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> his four-fold restitution in case of <hi>rapine</hi> and <hi>extortion;</hi> he used that frequent expression in that case, to wit, <hi>Non dimittitur peccatum nisi restituatur ablatum,</hi> that is, no man can expect <hi>pardon</hi> from God of the <hi>wrong</hi> done to anothers <hi>estate,</hi> except he makes <hi>full restitution</hi> to the wronged person, if it may possibly be done: This was as a <hi>dart</hi> directed by the hand of God to the <hi>heart</hi> of our young <hi>School-boy;</hi> who together with one <hi>John Trigg</hi> (afterwards a famous Physitian in <hi>London)</hi> had the very week before, robbed the Orchard of one <hi>Goodman Jude</hi> of that Town, and had filled their <hi>Pockets</hi> as well as their <hi>Bellies,</hi> with the <hi>spoils</hi> of a Mellow-Pear-Tree.</p>
               <p>At, and <hi>after</hi> Sermon he <hi>mourned</hi> much, and took not <hi>any</hi> sleep all the <hi>night</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; <note place="margin">Restitution offered for unjust taking a few Pears.</note> and early on the Monday morning he went to his <hi>companion Trigg,</hi> and told him, that he was then going to <hi>Goodman Jude</hi>'s to carry him 12 <hi>pence</hi> by way of <hi>restitution</hi> for three penny worth of Pears, of which he had wronged him: <hi>Trigg</hi> (fearing that if the thing were confessed to <hi>Goodman Jude, Jude</hi> would acquaint Mr. <hi>Robotham</hi> their Master therewith; and that <hi>corporal</hi> correction would follow) did earnestly <hi>strive</hi> to divert this <hi>poor Child</hi> from his <hi>purpose</hi> of restitution; but <hi>Fairclough</hi> replyed, that God would not pardon the <hi>sin</hi> except <hi>restitution</hi> was made; to which <hi>Trigg</hi> answer'd thus, <hi>Thou talkest like a fool</hi> Sam, <hi>God will forgive us ten times; sooner than old</hi> Jude <hi>will forgive us once:</hi> But our <hi>Samuel</hi> was of <hi>another</hi> mind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he goes on to <hi>Jude</hi>'s house, and there told him his errand, and <hi>offer'd him a shilling,</hi> which <hi>Goodman Jude</hi> refusing (although he declared the <hi>forgiveness</hi> of the wrong, yet) the youths <hi>wound</hi> smarted the <hi>more</hi> thereby, so that he could get no <hi>rest</hi> until he went to his <hi>spiritual Father</hi> Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> and had opened to him the whole <hi>state</hi> of his <hi>Soul,</hi> both upon the account of <hi>this</hi> particular sin and many others, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62667:112"/> most <hi>especially,</hi> the sin of sins, the <hi>original</hi> sin and depravation of his <hi>nature.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> received him with great <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>tenderness,</hi> and proved the good <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> to him, <hi>pouring Wine and Oil into his wounds,</hi> answering all his <hi>questions,</hi> satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his <hi>fears,</hi> and preached <hi>Jesus</hi> to him so <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>effectually,</hi> that he became a true and sincere <hi>Convert,</hi> and <hi>dedicated</hi> and <hi>devoted</hi> himself to his <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> all the days of his life after.</p>
               <p>Being designed for <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he was recommended by a friend of his, one Mr. <hi>Allington,</hi> unto Mr. <hi>Berry</hi> a Fellow of <hi>Queens-Colledge,</hi> to whom he <hi>went;</hi> and <note place="margin">His going to the University</note> having delivered Mr. <hi>Allington's</hi> Letter, he (with a most humble confidence) begged <hi>leave</hi> to speak a few words to him; and then informed him that he was the Son of a <hi>worthy Divine</hi> who dyed <hi>five</hi> years before, that he had continued at <hi>School</hi> ever since, and that his <hi>elder Brethren</hi> had carried away almost all his <hi>Fathers</hi> Estate with them into the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> so that he had but little to <hi>spend,</hi> and not any thing to recommend him to a <hi>Tutour,</hi> but the knowledge he had obtained in the <hi>Greek and Latine tongues,</hi> and, (which he was willing to promise) further <hi>diligence</hi> in his Studies, and a chearful <hi>observance</hi> of the commands of any <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who would make tryal thereof. He added, that it might seem a great piece of <hi>impudence,</hi> that a poor <hi>boy</hi> should thus address himself to so <hi>Reverend</hi> a person; but it was the report which Mr. <hi>Allington</hi> had given of his <hi>kindness,</hi> that made him <hi>hope</hi> now to find Charity <hi>there, where</hi> many other persons had <hi>experienced</hi> so much goodness at all times.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Berry,</hi> (who was in truth a very kind and good many was mightily <hi>pleased</hi> to see a young youth deliver himself so <hi>humbly,</hi> and yet so <hi>freely;</hi> he therefore first <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Berry</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him to Lodge and Study in his own Chamber.</note> posed him <hi>himself</hi> in all School <hi>Authours,</hi> both <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and finding him a perfect Master (almost) of both those Languages, he told him, that if Dr. <hi>Tindall,</hi> (the then Master of the Colledge) would approve of him, he should <hi>then</hi> be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the <hi>Colledge;</hi> and he sent him to the Dr. accordingly; who had no sooner made <hi>tryal</hi> of him, but did also greatly <hi>approve</hi> of him. But there was yet a <hi>mighty</hi> difficulty in the <hi>way</hi> of his admission: for there was <hi>not one Study empty</hi> in the whole Colledge, and for <hi>want</hi> thereof, many <hi>Scholars</hi> had been <hi>rejected</hi> that year: But Mr. <hi>Berry</hi> would not <hi>upon this account</hi> reject <hi>him,</hi> but he set up a Bed in his <hi>own</hi> Chamber for him, and gave him liberty to <hi>study</hi> there, until <hi>another</hi> study should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come void. Thus was he admitted into <hi>Queens Colledge in Cambridge</hi> in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner. I cannot say he was admitted <hi>Fellow-Commoner,</hi> but he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Chamber-fellow</hi> and <hi>fellow-Student</hi> with his own <hi>Tutour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had not been above two years in the Colledge before <hi>Spencer Lord Compton,</hi> eldest Son of <hi>William Earl of Northampton,</hi> was designed for the <hi>Ʋniversity,</hi> and for <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi> wants a Sub-tutour for his Son, and Dr. <hi>Tyndall</hi> bids him write for the place.</note> that <hi>Colledge</hi> also. The <hi>Earl</hi> would <hi>needs</hi> have his Son to have <hi>two</hi> Tutours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>other</hi> might always he <hi>with him;</hi> Dr. <hi>Towers,</hi> afterwards <hi>Bishop of Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> was chosen by the <hi>Earl</hi> for his head Tutour, and the <hi>Earl</hi> wrote to Dr. <hi>Tyndall</hi> to provide a <hi>Sub-tutour,</hi> who might <hi>converse</hi> with the young Lord, and <hi>take care</hi> of him, as often as Dr. <hi>Towers</hi> was absent. The Master was then at his <hi>Deanery of Ely</hi> with some <hi>Fellows</hi> of the Colledge, where he received the <hi>Earl</hi>'s Letter, which he had no sooner done, but he concluded with <hi>himself</hi> that this <hi>Fairclough</hi> would be a most <hi>fit</hi> person for <hi>this</hi> place; the next day therefore he sent for him to <hi>Ely,</hi> and told him that he must write immediately a <hi>Latine Letter</hi> to the <hi>Earl,</hi> and therein offer his Service to the <hi>young Lord,</hi> his Son. The task was very <hi>difficult</hi> for so <hi>young</hi> a person to undertake, but the imployment was <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>profitable;</hi> the constant Sallery was to be 30 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and thereby also a door of <hi>preferment</hi> was certainly opened for the <hi>future,</hi> if his <hi>genius</hi> should lead him either to <hi>travel</hi> beyond Sea with the young <hi>Lord,</hi> or if his <hi>inclination</hi> should prompt him to attend on the old <hi>Earl</hi> at home, who was a great <hi>Favourite at Court.</hi> All which, Dr. <hi>Tyndall</hi> did intimate to him, and then <hi>left</hi> him to compose such a Letter, whilst <hi>himself</hi> and the <hi>Fellows</hi> that were with him, and some of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> went to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>another</hi> room; where they had not <hi>fully</hi> dined, before the <hi>Letter</hi> was sent in <hi>finished</hi> as a <hi>third course.</hi> Mr. <hi>Preston,</hi> afterwards the renowned Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> was one of the Fellows then at dinner. The Dean and the whole <hi>Company</hi> were amazed when they read the Letter, both for the <hi>manliness</hi> of the sense, the <hi>richness</hi> of the fancy, the <hi>sweetness</hi> of the expression, the <hi>elegancy</hi> of the Latine, and the <hi>bravery</hi> of the whole Texture, but Mr. <hi>Preston</hi> discerned <hi>especially</hi> the seriousness, sobriety, and a seeming Piety that <hi>breathed</hi> in every line; and from that time he <hi>received</hi> this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62667:113"/> young man (although somewhat his <hi>Junior)</hi> into intimate Society and Familiarity with himself.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Epistle</hi> was sent by the <hi>Dr.</hi> to the <hi>Earl,</hi> who having read it, and <hi>observed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Earl likes the Epistle, and sends ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Goods and much money to him; to try his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and faithfulness.</note> much of <hi>accuracy</hi> therein, did rejoice that his Son should converse <hi>with,</hi> and in many things be <hi>guided by</hi> such a <hi>Scholar,</hi> who although but <hi>young</hi> in age, yet did manifestly appear <hi>learned, grave and prudent</hi> beyond his years. The next day therefore after the receipt of the <hi>Letter,</hi> there were <hi>many</hi> rich Goods and <hi>much</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture sent to this <hi>Lad</hi> to take care of, and <hi>orders</hi> were given him further to <hi>furnish</hi> the Chambers with <hi>every</hi> thing that should be <hi>wanting.</hi> There were several Trunks sent also full of <hi>rich</hi> Cloaths, and <hi>much money;</hi> the <hi>Keys</hi> of <hi>all which</hi> were delivered to him, with notice that the <hi>Earl's Son</hi> would be at the <hi>Colledge</hi> about <hi>three</hi> weeks after. This was <hi>done</hi> (and mention thereof is <hi>here made)</hi> because the <hi>Earl after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> acknowledged, that he did <hi>hereby</hi> make <hi>tryal</hi> of the Scholars <hi>temper,</hi> both as to his <hi>faithfulness,</hi> and also to his <hi>discretion.</hi>

                  </note> that Town; having heard much of his <hi>worth,</hi> sent him a Letter by one Mr. <hi>Matthew Clark,</hi> subscribed with all their names, <hi>intneating</hi> him that he would come and be their <hi>Lecturer.</hi> He so far <hi>complyed</hi> with their desires as to go to <hi>Lynn</hi> and <hi>preached</hi> amongst them, who then offered him 50 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and a <hi>fair</hi> dwelling house at the <hi>charge</hi> of the <hi>Corporation,</hi> if he would come unto them. The people also <hi>Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned</hi> him to come thither, and promised to make his <hi>Sallery</hi> up an 100 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> if he would <hi>accept;</hi> but he desired some time to consider, before he would <hi>give his answer.</hi> And the reason of his desire was this, to wit, a little <hi>before</hi> his going to <hi>Lynn,</hi> the Town of <hi>Clare</hi> had invited him to be a <hi>Lecturer</hi> with them, and although the Revenue of <hi>Clare</hi> was not above a <hi>quarter</hi> so much as what was promised to him at <hi>Lynn,</hi> yet <hi>Clare</hi> was near Mr. <hi>Blackerby's</hi> House, whose Society he <hi>highly</hi> prized. Returning therefore to Mr. <hi>Blackerby,</hi> and advising with him, and with divers other friends, they all perswaded him to go to <hi>Lynn,</hi> which was a great Town, and thereby his opportunities of doing <hi>God Service</hi> would be <hi>far more</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> than at <hi>Clare.</hi> Hereupon he went to <hi>Lynn,</hi> and continued there some time.</p>
               <p>But it happened to him there, as it did to the <hi>Apostle,</hi> to wit, to be greatly <hi>envied</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Importunity</hi> from <hi>such</hi> a person (in such a case) could not be long denied, and <note place="margin">He accepteth</note> Mr. <hi>Fairolough,</hi> who had spent <hi>some years</hi> in doing the work of an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at <hi>length</hi> greatly to <hi>doubt,</hi> whether he had done <hi>well,</hi> in not taking upon him some <hi>Pastoral charge,</hi> many places having been before <hi>offered</hi> to him.

               </p>
               <p>He did compare <hi>publick Preaching</hi> to <hi>sowing</hi> of Seed, and <hi>private discourse</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Plow-mans <hi>harrowing, healing</hi> or <hi>covering</hi> the Seed, without which, the <hi>Fowls of the Air,</hi> that is, a multitude of diverting thoughts, and the <hi>Prince of the Air</hi> also, the Devil, (by his <hi>temptations)</hi> would soon <hi>pick</hi> up the word, without <hi>fruit</hi> or <hi>benefit.</hi> At another time he compared <hi>publick Preaching</hi> to that Rain, that falls upon many <hi>narrow mouthed bottles,</hi> the greatest part <hi>whereof</hi> falls besides the mouths of the Vessels, so that they were rarely filled; but <hi>private instruction</hi> and <hi>admonition,</hi> he would say, was like a mans taking a <hi>single Bottle</hi> into his hand, and pouring in water into it with a <hi>Funnel,</hi> whereby it was soon filled.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was Minister <hi>here</hi> (which was not above five years) he was desired not only by the People, but by the Minister also of one of the Parish Churches of <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>

Hereupon one of the <hi>other</hi> Ministers of the Town (whose Congregation had been but small that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon) being displeased thereat, did <hi>draw up</hi> certain <hi>Articles</hi> against this <hi>innocent</hi> person, as against a <hi>factious seditious</hi> man; and exhibited them in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> grounding his accusation <hi>barely</hi> upon this <hi>repetition</hi> of his Sermons in the Family where he Lodged: Hereupon he was <hi>convened</hi> before the <hi>Lords of the high Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi> where although he made a <hi>Legal, clear</hi> and <hi>full</hi> defence, yet that Court being <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> he could not obtain a <hi>dismission;</hi> till after two years attendance; the charge of his Journeys, and the Fees of <hi>Proctors, Advocates</hi> and <hi>Councel</hi> did swallow up <hi>(those two</hi> years) the whole profit of his <hi>little living;</hi> and he had continued <hi>longer</hi> in trouble if Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent</hi> (his chief Councel and Advocate) had not <hi>at last</hi> humbly petitioned the Court in the name of his <hi>Client,</hi> that the business might be referred to the Petitioners <hi>Diocesan</hi> and <hi>Ordinary</hi> at <hi>Norwich;</hi> which being granted, a <hi>good number of Jacobusses</hi> procured a certain Lady in <hi>Norwich</hi> to gain such a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as obtained a full discharge.</p>
               <p>But that forementioned <hi>attendance</hi> upon the <hi>Court,</hi> and the <hi>gaining</hi> this discharge <note place="margin">The Devils temptation conquered.</note> from his <hi>Ordinary</hi> in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> without any personal attendance upon the <hi>Bishop;</hi> did bring him very much into <hi>Debt;</hi> he had also four Children then born, and he looked for more.

While he thus <hi>mused</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> burnt <hi>hotter</hi> and <hi>hotter</hi> within him, so that he was forced to give himself <hi>vent</hi> in <hi>several Sermons</hi> upon this very Text; and in the handling thereof he <hi>so</hi> stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the <hi>excellency</hi> of the Life of <hi>Faith</hi> in the want of <hi>Creature supplies,</hi> that the <hi>Devil</hi> was not only vanquished in his <hi>present</hi> assault, but was also subdued so; that he never dared to <hi>tempt</hi> him in <hi>this kind after</hi> to his dying day.</p>
               <p>And this account we have from his own <hi>Diary,</hi> which he kept <hi>constantly,</hi> from <note place="margin">His Diary was begun at 20 years old.</note> his age of <hi>twenty</hi> years, and (daily almost) wrote down in it a full History of all God's <hi>dealing</hi> with him, and of the daily <hi>frame</hi> of his own <hi>heart,</hi> and of <hi>Satans</hi> temptations (and of the <hi>assistances</hi> of Gods Spirit in them) and his <hi>victory over</hi> them.

               <p>Dr. <hi>Gibson</hi> (who was Incumbent of the <hi>Rectory of Ketton)</hi> had some Friends at <note place="margin">His removal to <hi>Ketton.</hi>

Up went the <hi>Dr. hereupon,</hi> but it pleased God to <hi>afflict</hi> him so soon as he came to the <hi>City,</hi> with a severe sickness, whereof he <hi>dyed.</hi> News hereof was presently sent down to the <hi>Patron,</hi> Sir <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Barnardiston;</hi> and it was soon spread abroad in the <hi>Countrey.</hi> The Patron would have sent the Presentation of the Living immediately to Mr. <hi>Fairclough,</hi> but his <hi>Lady</hi> advised him to <hi>defer</hi> it a while, that so an opportunity might be given of <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning,</hi> and a trial might be made, whether Mr. <hi>Fairclough</hi> would re-mind his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the <hi>Promise</hi> which was made at his coming to <hi>Barnardiston,</hi> yea or no; the Patron therefore delayed till after he heard of the Doctors <hi>Interment,</hi> but no Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came; and the Patron knew Mr. <hi>Fairclough</hi> too well really to expect any <hi>from</hi> him; he therefore after a while, sent his <hi>eldest</hi> Son (who was then but <hi>young)</hi> with a <hi>Servant,</hi> and with a <hi>Presentation</hi> of this <hi>Living</hi> unto Mr. <hi>Fairclough;</hi> who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a very <hi>thankful</hi> Letter by the same hand, acknowledging his great <hi>obligations</hi> to the Patron for his <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>kindness</hi> to him, but <hi>withall</hi> told him, That he stood so engaged <hi>now</hi> to his <hi>present People,</hi> that without their <hi>consents</hi> he could not <hi>leave</hi> them. Hereupon his Patron did the same Week summon all the People of <hi>Barnardiston,</hi> (most of whom were his <hi>Tenants)</hi> to his House, and told them, that as in love to <hi>their</hi> Souls he had formerly presented this Minister to them, so in love now to the Souls of the People of <hi>Ketton,</hi> he was resolved to bring him to <hi>Ketton;</hi> but he still would take <hi>care</hi> that a <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>learned Minister</hi> should succeed, one that might <hi>watch</hi> over their Souls, naming Mr. <hi>Westley,</hi> the then Lecturer of <hi>Haverill.</hi> He farther added, that for divers years himself and his Family, had come from <hi>Ketton</hi> to <hi>Barnardiston</hi> once every Lords day, having built Pewes on purpose there; and if they did now <hi>value</hi> Mr. <hi>Fairclough</hi>'s <hi>Ministry</hi> as he had always done, they might come <hi>once</hi> a day to <hi>Ketton.</hi> The <hi>nearness</hi> of the Parishes one from the other, the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Landlord, and his consciencious care in providing a <hi>good</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour for them, produced a <hi>silence</hi> in them, and a <hi>half</hi> consent, which was interpreted by the Patron to be <hi>sufficient,</hi> because at Mr. <hi>Fairclough's</hi> first go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Barnardiston,</hi> the People had notice that he was placed there <hi>but</hi> for a <hi>time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing more must <hi>here</hi> be inserted, to wit, that the institution of him into <note place="margin">His Institution granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going to <hi>Norwich.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Rectory</hi> of <hi>Ketton,</hi> was procured by the Patron from the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Diocess,</hi> as the Institution into <hi>Barnardiston</hi> had been <hi>before,</hi> namely, without the <hi>Incumbent's</hi> taking the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience,</hi> or his subscription to the <hi>three Articles.</hi> How this was <hi>effected,</hi> we shall not here <hi>inquire;</hi> but it was <hi>done both times</hi> without the Incumbents <hi>personal</hi> attendance upon the <hi>Bishop.</hi> And thus now was he settled in <hi>Ketton</hi> in the Country of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> to the great joy and comfort of all persons, both in <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Countrey;</hi> the Parish Church of <hi>Ketton</hi> being very capacious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive, whereas the <hi>former</hi> Church of <hi>Barnardiston</hi> was very <hi>small</hi> and <hi>strait.</hi> Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes now therefore <hi>througed</hi> to be his Auditors, and were so to their <hi>unspeakable</hi> advantage and delight. He was about <hi>Five and thirty years of age</hi> when he came to <hi>Ketton,</hi> and he continued near <hi>five and thirty years there;</hi> all which time (saving a little <hi>Interval</hi> by reason of sickness) he constantly preached <hi>four times a Week</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his daily Expositions in his Family) to wit, <hi>twice</hi> every Lords day, <hi>once</hi> every <hi>Thursday</hi> (a publick Lecture) and <hi>once</hi> every <hi>Saturday</hi> night (in his own house) in preparation for the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> The <hi>frequency</hi> of his Preaching hindered not the <hi>ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borateness</hi> of his Discourses.

               <p>He had amost <hi>stupendious memory.</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> I remember, reckons the faculty of mans <note place="margin">His amazing memory.</note> memory to be one of the <hi>Worlds wonders;</hi> memory being a power able to treasure up in it self a <hi>multitude</hi> of <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of things which it <hi>hath seen,</hi> and being able to lay up conceived Forms and Images of things which it <hi>never saw,</hi> and to make such lasting <hi>impressions</hi> of them upon the brain; so as that <hi>long after</hi> it is able
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62667:117"/> (upon occasion) to call every of them forth from their <hi>dark hidden Abyss,</hi> and to rank them in their due order and place them in the <hi>light.</hi> This, to that Father, was very <hi>amazing,</hi> and in some instances indeed it is very <hi>wonderful</hi> and <hi>miraculous;</hi> and such was the power of memory which was found in this person. He seldom used any <hi>Concordance;</hi> for there was not a <hi>passage</hi> of the whole <hi>Scripture</hi> almost, that could be mentioned to him, but he would tell you not only the <hi>Chapter</hi> and <hi>Verse,</hi> but the <hi>place</hi> of the page where it was Printed in the <hi>Bibles</hi> of <hi>Barkers Edition,</hi> (of which only, he made use of near <hi>fifty</hi> years together) reading over the Bible <hi>four</hi> times in a year at <hi>the least;</hi> so that it might be said <hi>of him,</hi> that he was a <hi>walking Bible,</hi> both as to the <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>

               <p>Indeed he was furnished with all <hi>rare intellectual parts,</hi> he had a <hi>quick invention,</hi> a <hi>lofty fancy,</hi> a <hi>solid judgment,</hi> which easily and readily <hi>weighed</hi> the nature of all <note place="margin">His great parts.</note> things, and constantly <hi>cast the ballance</hi> on the side of <hi>truth;</hi> he could <hi>dive</hi> into the bottom of the most abstruse matters, and <hi>fetch</hi> truth from thence; and having <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered</hi> it, he did always cloath his <hi>apprehensions</hi> of things, with the most <hi>clear</hi> and most <hi>full</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> expressions, which they were capable of.</p>

                  <hi>Conciones ad Clerum,</hi> and those Discourses deserved to be so called, both for the <hi>accuracy</hi> of them, and also because they were actually Preached to so <hi>great</hi> a number of the <hi>Clergy; all the Ministers</hi> (for many miles compass) coming constantly to hear them; and there were frequently not less than <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twenty Scholars</hi> (both Fellows of Colledges and others) from <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Indeed he was a man much <hi>acquainted</hi> with God, and with his <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>will.</hi> It might be said of him, that <hi>he had the mind of Christ,</hi> and <hi>had also the tongue of the Learned,</hi> and was able to oppress himself with the greatest <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>He was a most profound Divine, and one of the best and clearest <hi>Expositors</hi> of <note place="margin">An excellent Expositor of Scripture.</note>
                  <hi>holy Writ,</hi> which that age produced. It was an expression used concerning him by a great Scholar, sometimes Fellow of <hi>Magdalen Colledge,</hi> who was seldom absent from any of these <hi>Lectures,</hi> that though he would not say of him what <hi>Cicero</hi> saith of <hi>Plato,</hi> That if <hi>Jupiter</hi> were to discourse, he would do it in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Language; yet he would venture to say, That if <hi>Angels</hi> were to Preach, they would do it in Mr. <hi>Fairclough</hi>'s Stile. More especially he said, he loved him for his gift in opening the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which he did so clearly, and so fully, that whatever <hi>Text</hi> he did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to <hi>Expound,</hi> he did so extract the <hi>whole</hi> meaning of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> from it, as that he left never a <hi>drop</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> behind, which would either <hi>naturally flow,</hi> or could tolerably be <hi>squeezed</hi> thence.</p>
               <p>He had a most <hi>metaphysical</hi> head, and a very <hi>searching</hi> mind after <hi>truth,</hi> greatly <note place="margin">His reason of not Printing divers excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent discourses</note> delighting himself in studying the nature of <hi>incorporeal beings;</hi> but above all, in contemplating the <hi>Divine Attributes and Essence.</hi> He was very much read in all <hi>Authors</hi> that did treat of such Subjects as these; and in his private Studies, he did <hi>compose</hi> and <hi>write</hi> divers excellent and elaborate Discourses about the <hi>Soul of Man,</hi> the light of <hi>nature,</hi> the <hi>freedom</hi> of the Will, together with a <hi>learned discourse</hi> about the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God; which he was very much <hi>importuned</hi> to have <hi>Printed;</hi> but he could never be perswaded thereto, giving this <hi>reason</hi> of his <hi>denial,</hi> to wit, That formerly, the <hi>Civil</hi> Wars, and of late, the great <hi>Impositions</hi> upon mens <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> (about some things which were judged <hi>unlawful,</hi> and many things <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>disputable)</hi> had drawn too <hi>many</hi> (even of the Learned part of the world) into <hi>factions</hi> and <hi>parties,</hi> and had bred such animosities between them, that <hi>few</hi> Books could <hi>meet</hi> with <hi>impartial</hi> Readers.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Lords-days</hi> exercises, which were <hi>ad populum,</hi> to a plain Countrrey People <note place="margin">He studied to be understood by the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</note> of his own and Neighbour Parishes; he very rarely Preached about any <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> point, and did never stuff his Sermons with <hi>nice</hi> speculations and <hi>intricate</hi> disputes. He loved not to meddle in his <hi>popular</hi> Sermons, with those points that lie <hi>out of</hi> common reach, and were apt to perplex honest minds. He industriously studied <hi>plainness,</hi> therein following both the <hi>pattern</hi> and <hi>example</hi> of his old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance the Reverend <hi>Archbishop Ʋsher,</hi> and the special <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Advice</hi> of his old friend Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> who discoursing with him at his <hi>first entry</hi> upon the Ministry, told him, That although the <hi>Ancients</hi> did place the Statutes of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Apollo;</hi> thereby intimating, that no man could be a <hi>perswasive Oratour,</hi> who did not join <hi>elegancy</hi> of <hi>fancy</hi> with <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>reason;</hi> yet it was Dr. <hi>Preston's</hi> judgment, That that man was the best Preacher, vvho delivered <hi>Gospel</hi>

                  <hi>truths</hi> in the plainest Scriptural expressions; and such a Preacher was this <hi>Reverend</hi> Divine afterwards all his days.</p>
               <p>His great design in his Ministry, was first to awaken the Consciences of obstinate <note place="margin">That their Consciences might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened.</note> sinners; and then to make known to them the way of salvation. He understood his business and errand very well, and accordingly he endeavoured to approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self faithful in the delivery thereof. He clearly saw that Souls were eternally lost, if they were not convinced of their sinful state by Nature, and were not renewed in the Spirit of their minds through Grace; whatever therefore he judged most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conducing thereunto, he made use thereof, always chusing and insisting upon such subjects as were most concerning, and of greatest import; which he handled in the most convincing manner, and delivered himself with so much clearness, that although his Stile and Language was far remote from common talk or vulgar mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet he would be sure to strive to accommodate his expressions to the capacity of his Hearers, and would stoop to the weakest and lowest form of them. His great aim was to instruct the ignorant, which he found a very hard work to do. He sought not to shew his own parts, or to make himself admired, for that he found was a thing hardly to be avoided. He always esteemed it better to serve God in all things, than to serve himself in any thing. He knew that soft and inticing words of mans Wisdom would not save Souls; balking therefore all ceremonial Complements, he would make bold to pull and snatch (as it were) sinners, as brands out of the Fire, by any ways or means he could think of. He was one of those Puritan Preachers, whom Prince <hi>Henry</hi> loved to hear, because (said he) such Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goes next the heart. <hi>Dr.</hi> Lloid, <hi>Dying mens words,</hi> p. 139.</p>
               <p>He always proved whatever he delivered, with the greatest <hi>rational</hi> evidence and <note place="margin">He demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth every thing by soundest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Scriptural <hi>argument;</hi> and his Doctrine being thus <hi>strenuously</hi> inforced, came from him with great <hi>authority,</hi> and did strike a very great <hi>awe</hi> into the hearts of his Hearers. None could be his Auditor, but that he must needs perceive that he was sent <hi>of God,</hi> and that it was <hi>no other</hi> than a message from <hi>Heaven</hi> that was delivered to them <hi>by him,</hi> which did greatly <hi>awaken</hi> the <hi>drowsie</hi> hearts of some, and <hi>restrained</hi> the Spirits of others, who were hasting unto ruine; and <hi>influenced</hi> all men (almost) <hi>one way or other:</hi> Such as were <hi>godly</hi> were greatly edified and built up in their holy Faith. To <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> and <hi>broken</hi> hearts, he was a very <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a Son of <hi>consolation.</hi> He had a <hi>rare faculty</hi> in <hi>prescribing</hi> to the <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>cure</hi> of <hi>wounded</hi> Spirits.

He was able at all times to find out and set in order, both such acceptable <hi>words,</hi> and such cogent <hi>reasons</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> as did command a <hi>regard,</hi> and force a <hi>complyance;</hi> so that he was as another St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and did <hi>dominari in concionibus;</hi> acting the part of a <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Soveraign,</hi> speaking as one having <hi>authority</hi> (under his Master) and not as the <hi>Scribes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word he dispenced the truth of God as one acted by a mighty <hi>Faith,</hi> having <note place="margin">He preached from his own head and heart, to both head and hearts of his Hearers.</note> both a <hi>real</hi> inward sense of what he <hi>delivered,</hi> and so great a desire of his peoples <hi>Salvation,</hi> as that he seemed to be resolved to take <hi>no denial</hi> from them. He was wont to say, That when the heart of a Minister is truly <hi>inflamed</hi> with love to his peoples <hi>happiness,</hi> it is then <hi>impossible</hi> but that their <hi>expressions</hi> and <hi>exhortations</hi> should be very <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>warm,</hi> whereas the <hi>coldness</hi> and <hi>flatness</hi> of some mens discourses, is <hi>such</hi> as their words seem (as it were) to <hi>Freez</hi> between their lips, and do evidence how <hi>dead</hi> (or luke-warm at best) their <hi>inward</hi> affections are to the things of God.

               <p>And by the operation of the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> they became very <hi>effectual,</hi> multitudes <note place="margin">His great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting sinners from the error of their ways.</note> being wrought upon, and <hi>turned from the errour of their ways.</hi> Few Ministers had such cause of rejoycing as he had, upon this account; so that (since the Apostles days) there was scarce any person more <hi>visibly instrumental</hi> in saving Souls than he. It might be said of him, that in his <hi>fishing</hi> for Souls, he went not forth with a <hi>single Angling Rod,</hi> to take here and there one (which is all the <hi>success</hi> of Ministers of late days) but he made use of a <hi>Net,</hi> (as the Apostles did) whereby he caught <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi> at once, great numbers being added, not only to the <hi>visible,</hi> but also to the <hi>invisible</hi> Church of God by his Labours. He left in his <hi>Diary</hi> the names of <hi>some hundreds</hi> recorded there, who had all <hi>expresly</hi> owned him to be their <hi>Spiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the proper means of their <hi>first conversion,</hi> and of their <hi>future Salvation</hi> as they hoped; and in that <hi>Catalogue</hi> mention is made of <hi>some persons</hi> who declared <hi>to him,</hi> that the <hi>first work</hi> of Gods Spirit which they discerned in themselves, was at such times as they were joining <hi>with him</hi> in his Prayer <hi>before Sermon;</hi> wherein he being the mouth of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> he confessed <hi>such</hi> sins as he <hi>supposed</hi> some (at least) of his <hi>Congregation</hi> might be guilty of; and it seems the Spirit ordered his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to be <hi>such,</hi> as reached the case of divers that were present. With his confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was joined (as his usual manner was) such <hi>aggravations</hi> of the hainousness of those sins, as thereby a <hi>prick</hi> was given to the <hi>hearts</hi> of the guilty, so as some could not but follow him home, using the same words of the Converts in the <hi>Acts, Sir, What shall I do to be saved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God indeed had given him a mighty gift in prayer, and God did bless the use of <note place="margin">Great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation wrought in the whole Town.</note> both Prayer and Preaching to the great benefit of his <hi>People.</hi> The Town, when he came first to it, was very <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>prophane;</hi> being generally <hi>Aliens and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Common-wealth of Israel, and living without God in the world;</hi> there was not one Family in twenty who did then <hi>call upon the name of the Lord,</hi> or had the Worship of God set up in it; but in a short time after his coming, he had so <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to them, and so <hi>prayed</hi> with them and for them, as there was not one Family in twenty but <hi>professed godliness,</hi> and the Governours thereof <hi>did daily offer up their morning and their evening sacrifice constantly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon himself God had <hi>poured out an abundant measure of the Spirit of Grace and</hi>

It was very <hi>affecting</hi> to discern Gifts and Graces thus in <hi>conjunction.</hi> He well knew how to sute his expressions <hi>properly</hi> to every particular <hi>occasion,</hi> whether he <hi>petitioned</hi> for any special <hi>mercy</hi> to be <hi>obtained,</hi> or did <hi>deprecate</hi> the <hi>removal</hi> or <hi>amotion</hi> of any <hi>evil felt</hi> or <hi>feared;</hi> all which he performed, though with great <hi>fervour</hi> and <hi>zeal,</hi> yet with such intire <hi>resignation</hi> and <hi>submission</hi> to the divine <hi>will,</hi> as that, in all things it was <hi>manifested,</hi> that love to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Glory,</hi> were the great wheels and <hi>inward principles,</hi> that gave <hi>life and breath</hi> to all his desires. He had a tender heart, and in a day of Humiliation he discovered such <hi>brokenness and contrition</hi> of Spirit as did soon melt the hearts of others; and on such days his Church was commonly a <hi>Bochim;</hi> so that all that joined with him wished, and many found with <hi>Jeremiah, That their heads were rivers, and their eyes fountains of tears,</hi> they seemed so universally <hi>to lament after the Lord.</hi> Every Lords day (especially in his last prayer of his Afternoon Sermon) he was very large in the <hi>thanksgiving</hi> part of that Ordinance; which he performed as if he had been one of the <hi>heavenly Quire.</hi> At this new Service he seemed to recover new life and strength, and oh! how great were the <hi>raptures!</hi> how lofty were the <hi>strains!</hi> how wonderful were the <hi>inlargements</hi> of Soul which he experienced in the performance of that <hi>Angelical work of praise!</hi> He never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Zion,</hi> but begged as often, and more <hi>earnestly,</hi> that <hi>Gods Name might be hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and that the <hi>Kingdom of his Son might come,</hi> than ever he did for his own daily bread.</p>

               <p>As he was a man much <hi>with</hi> God in prayer, so he was one whose prayers God <note place="margin">Return of Prayers.</note> did <hi>often</hi> (and sometimes very signally) answer.

               <p>His wife, about a year after his marriage (being great with Child) became very <note place="margin">His wife sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Drowning.</note> sickly, and continued <hi>very infirm,</hi> till within a <hi>fortnight</hi> of her <hi>time.</hi> He had all along <hi>wrestled with God</hi> very much upon <hi>her behalf,</hi> and had spent much time in prayer <hi>with her;</hi> but now he was resolved to spend a day in Fasting and Prayer, <hi>alone by himself,</hi> upon her account; and his Wife did see apart the same day for prayer by herself in another room: In the duty he did <hi>again and again</hi> mightily implore the <hi>grace and mercy of God</hi> for her, and earnestly begged of God to <hi>appear</hi> in her behalf, that <hi>she might obtain mercy, and sind help at the time of her need.</hi> In the Evening and <hi>close</hi> of the day, while he was the <hi>seventh</hi> time upon his knees, he heard a <hi>mighty shriek</hi> abroad, (but not far from the house) which he guessed to be the voice of his wife, and so it was; for his Wife having spent also <hi>most part</hi> of the day in prayer, did in the <hi>Evening,</hi> walk abroad, <hi>meditating</hi> upon the promises of God, made to <hi>persons in her case and condition;</hi> and <hi>contemplating</hi> of the infinite <hi>power</hi> of God, whereby he was able to <hi>make good</hi> his <hi>promise</hi> in the <hi>greatest</hi> difficulties and distresses. Her mind was deeply ingaged herein; whilst going by the <hi>side of a Pond</hi> in an adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Field, her <hi>feet slipped</hi> so, as she fell over head and ears into the <hi>water;</hi> but she shricked <hi>in her fall,</hi> which her husband hearing, and coming down hastily, missed her <hi>within doors,</hi> and therefore ran <hi>so hastily</hi> to the Pond, that although she had sunk <hi>twice,</hi> yet he caught her <hi>by the hand</hi> before she sunk the third time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by saved her life. This happened in the moneth of <hi>October,</hi> when the Water was exceeding cold; but it pleased God so to hear Prayer, that neither her fall caused Abortion, nor the Cold produced <hi>any evil affect,</hi> but that (in due time) her eldest Son was born, to their great comfort and joy.</p>
               <p>And yet a <hi>more memorable</hi> instance of the <hi>answer of prayer,</hi> is that which <hi>follows</hi>

This Child <hi>(at that hour)</hi> a Servant had taken up with her into the <hi>highest Garret</hi> of the house, and set him by the <hi>window</hi> of the Room, while she swept it, and so carelesly neglected to have her Eye upon the little one, as that the <hi>Child</hi> (looking out of the <hi>window</hi> upon a company of <hi>young Ducks,</hi> which were <hi>swimming</hi> in a Vessel of <hi>water</hi> right under the Casement) thrust its body so <hi>far out,</hi> as it <hi>fell down,</hi> and pitched first upon the Eaves of the next Floor, with that force, that it brake above a dozen Tiles off from the place, and <hi>with them</hi> fell down to the <hi>ground;</hi> but not into the Vessel of <hi>water,</hi> which stood perpendicular to the Window, but <hi>exactly between</hi> that Vessel and a <hi>large door</hi> which lay very near it, and upon which the meat for those Ducks was laid. Had it fallen a quarter of a yard on either hand, its Brains had been dashed out, either by the Door or Vessel; but God, by the <hi>ministration of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> so ordered it, that although the heigth of the place caused a <hi>dizziness,</hi> and a <hi>swoon for a few moments;</hi> yet the Child was no sooner taken up, but immediately it came to life again, and there was not the least bruise or hurt <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>outward,</hi> no not the least razing of the very Skin by any of the Tiles that fell with it; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one quarter of an hour, it went up and down the House, as it had formerly

               <p>Our good <hi>Father</hi> looked higher than to any <hi>natural causes,</hi> of his Childs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation; <note place="margin">His sense of mercy.</note> for when he was returned from his <hi>walk</hi> (which was near half an hour after the fall) at which hour he had <hi>prayed so earnestly</hi> to God for this Child) being told the Story of the Fall, and having observed the <hi>heighth of the Window,</hi> the <hi>broken Tiles,</hi> the posture of the <hi>Vessel</hi> and <hi>Door,</hi> and the <hi>place</hi> where the Child was <hi>taken up safe;</hi> he presently called all his Family, and many of his Neighbours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to join with him in giving God most <hi>solemn praise</hi> for his miraculous good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and for that wonderful return of prayer (made <hi>at that instant)</hi> for that little one.</p>
               <p>The next day (being the Lords day) he Preached two Thanksgiving Sermons in <note place="margin">His Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sermon, and Thank-offering and Vow.</note> publick, upon that Text, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 11, 12. <hi>He will give his Angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy ways: They shall bear thee up in their hands, that thou dash not thy foot against a stone.</hi> And in the close of the Evening Sermon of that day, he made and published this solemn Vow unto God, in these very words following. <hi>Brethren, after due consideration of the reasonableness, usefulness and possibility, as well as lawfulness, of making Vows in some cases, and of devoting part of a mans Estate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God (in a way of thankfulness) for mercy received; and after an humble acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my own weakness and unworthiness; I having invocated the Grace of God both for strength to inable me to perform this, and all other my Vows, and for Divine favour in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting me and it, through the Merits of Christ Jesus; I do solemnly Vow and Covenant with God, and expresly promise unto you, That I will give all the Tyth Wool of the whole Parish, which shall yearly become due unto me, during all the time of my future abode in this Town, unto the Poor of this Parish, to be yearly distributed amongst them, either in kind, or the full value thereof in money, before the first day of</hi> January <hi>every year, for, and towards their cloathing and maintenance.</hi> This Vow also, he did Register, and subscribe with his hand; and did always most <hi>piously</hi> and <hi>conscienciously,</hi> observe it yearly so long as he was Minister in that Town.</p>
               <p>Yea, he was so fully satisfied and pleased with what he had done herein; that <note place="margin">A Pin strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered in his younger Daughters Ear an answer of Prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by her life was saved.</note> some years after he devoted (in the same manner) all the <hi>Tyth Lambs</hi> of that Parish also, <hi>towards the relief of the Poor,</hi> and that, upon this occasion, <hi>viz.</hi> God having yet given him a seventh Child, which was his last; it pleased God (that when it was about <hi>half a year old)</hi> it was strangely troubled and afflicted with pain and sickness; which neither <hi>Physicians</hi> nor <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> could give any account of. Many <hi>eminent persons</hi> (of both sorts) had inspected the Child, but could <hi>not in the least</hi> guess at (much less find out) the nature of its <hi>Malady</hi> or <hi>Distemper.</hi> Many Weeks passed wherein the Child <hi>languished,</hi> and did daily fill the Ears of its Parents with its frequent loud Shrieks, and with its <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>perpetual</hi> dolour. The Parents hereupon did set apart <hi>a day of Prayer,</hi> solemnly to seek God in their Family for this poor <hi>afflicted Infant;</hi> in which Service God was pleased to give him <hi>great assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of his Spirit, and <hi>inlargement of heart;</hi> and the very next Morning follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while the Mother had the <hi>sick Child</hi> in her Lap, and rubbed its <hi>naked</hi> head with her hand, she felt a Pin to prick her hand; at which very much wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, she looked <hi>narrowly</hi> into the Ear of the Child, and there espyed the small end of a <hi>large Pin</hi> that was gotten very deep into it. It was very difficult to discern the end thereof, and more difficult to <hi>draw</hi> it forth, (the head of the Pin being <hi>downward,</hi> and almost <hi>eaten up</hi> with Rust) but it being <hi>pulled</hi> out, the Child was presently at ease, and recovered its health and liveliness, and that in a very short time. Many other strange instances of the <hi>answer of his prayers</hi> might be given, which he always received from the <hi>Father of mercies,</hi> with great gratitude and thankfulness; but he contented not himself with <hi>verbal praises,</hi> without study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how to express his <hi>sense of Divine Favour,</hi> by an exemplary devoting himself, and his <hi>all,</hi> unto God; as a <hi>real Thank-offering,</hi> to his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:62667:119"/>
               <p> The work of God thereby greatly prospered in his hand, the whole Town was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ketton</hi> a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to other Parishes.</note> yet <hi>more and more</hi> reformed, so that his Parish was a <hi>pattern</hi> to all his Neighbour Towns; and it was expected, and often said, that every Inhabitant of <hi>Ketton</hi> should be distinguished <hi>from others,</hi> not only by the more <hi>savouriness</hi> of their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but also by the universal strictness and Piety of their Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations.</p>
               <p>There was one great advantage which that Town and Corner had <hi>above</hi> most <note place="margin">The advantage of a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, his joyning with a good Minister.</note>
                  <hi>other</hi> places, and that was this, That the Magistracy and Ministry <hi>joined</hi> both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and <hi>concurred</hi> in all things for the <hi>promoting</hi> of true Piety and Godliness, The countenance and encouragement which a man of <hi>great Estate</hi> and Power doth give to a Minister, is of <hi>great</hi> import and influence unto his <hi>Ministry.</hi> Great was the <hi>love,</hi> and intimate was the <hi>affection</hi> which passed between the <hi>Patron</hi> of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and this <hi>Minister;</hi> so that they did <hi>mutually</hi> ingage to visit <hi>each</hi> other <hi>twice (at least)</hi> every Week, and did seldom meet without <hi>praying together</hi> before they did part. They <hi>heartily</hi> also joined hand in hand to <hi>promote</hi> both the <hi>form</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> of Godliness in that Town and County.</p>
               <p>Two things especially (in order hereunto) were endeavoured by them. First, To increase the knowledge of God, and of his Son; by <hi>Catechising</hi> both young and old, both governours and governed, one and other; and to the end that all (both <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>poor)</hi> might <hi>submit</hi> thereunto; this gracious and holy <hi>Knight,</hi> Sir <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel Barnardiston,</hi> perswaded several Masters of Families in the Town to <hi>consent,</hi> that when any <hi>such</hi> question should be asked in publick by the Minister, as that neither their <hi>Children</hi> nor <hi>Servants</hi> could answer; the Masters and Fathers of <hi>such</hi> Children or Servants <hi>respectively,</hi> should answer for them; and the Knight himself did engage the like for his Family; which course being taken, it was <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible</hi> to consider how greatly <hi>knowledge</hi> was advanced <hi>thereby</hi> in that Town.</p>
               <p>Another thing which the Patron and Minister <hi>designed,</hi> was to hinder the <hi>intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> or <hi>approaching</hi> of the <hi>visibly prophane</hi> unto the Table of the Lord. To this <note place="margin">The prophane are not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lords Supper.</note> end it was unanimously <hi>agreed,</hi> that every one who should desire to <hi>Communicate,</hi> should first publickly <hi>own his Baptismal Covenant for once,</hi> before his admission to the Lords Supper; and that <hi>afterwards</hi> they should submit unto <hi>admonition,</hi> in case of the visible and apparent breach of that Covenant. <hi>Accordingly</hi> this <hi>renowned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> did first lead the way, and before all the <hi>Communicants,</hi> he did declare his Faith in God through our Lord Jesus; and did undertake (through the <hi>assistance</hi> of the holy Spirit) to <hi>perform</hi> whatever his <hi>Sureties</hi> had promised <hi>in baptism</hi> upon his account. He was then <hi>followed</hi> (in the same manner) by all the rest who were about then to <hi>receive.</hi> As for others, they were <hi>wholly</hi> silenced, being convinced in their very <hi>Consciences,</hi> of the reasonableness of what had been <hi>required,</hi> and what was now done, by all the <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>sober</hi> persons of that Town.</p>
               <p>The administration of <hi>Confirmation</hi> practised in this <hi>excellent</hi> way and manner, <note place="margin">His use of right Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> could not but make a very effectual <hi>Reformation</hi> in that Town. Former prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was <hi>forced</hi> now to hide its head; Drunkenness, Swearing, Cursing, Bastardy, and the like, as they were not <hi>practised,</hi> so they were scarce <hi>known;</hi> divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons having <hi>lived many years</hi> in that Parish, and in the whole time they never heard <hi>an Oath</hi> sworn, or ever saw <hi>one person drunk,</hi> as they have professed.</p>
               <p>His Ministry was <hi>highly</hi> valued, not only by his <hi>own</hi> Parishioners, but also by <note place="margin">The high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and the blessings which did accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.</note> such as lived at a <hi>distance,</hi> of whom many did covet to come and <hi>dwell nearer,</hi> and to be of his Flock; and the rather, because it was generally <hi>reported,</hi> and upon good grounds <hi>believed,</hi> that there went a <hi>secret</hi> blessing along with the <hi>Gospel;</hi> and that as to Temporals as well as Spirituals. It was most <hi>visible,</hi> that many of the Farmers did mightily <hi>thrive,</hi> and grow <hi>rich,</hi> and the Landlords Revenue thereby did also <hi>increase,</hi> and was augmented. Many years thus passed, and was spent by this <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>painful</hi> Servant of Christ Jesus, wherein God was pleased <hi>abundantly</hi> to ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him with <hi>bodily</hi> strength to go through his <hi>Labours,</hi> and wherein God also did <hi>secure</hi> him from all <hi>molestation</hi> and trouble from <hi>abroad,</hi> which some <hi>others</hi> met with.</p>
               <p>But now about the year 1635. he was seized first with the <hi>Meagrim</hi> or <hi>Dizziness</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His hard Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his health</note> in his head, which afterwards turned to a <hi>violent pain.</hi> His Physicians told him, that his Distemper proceeded from <hi>over much Study,</hi> and from a <hi>Sedentary</hi> life; for the Cure whereof, they advised him to <hi>forbear</hi> Preaching; which he did a <hi>while;</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:62667:120"/> but found no <hi>relief</hi> thereby. Then they advised him to <hi>change Air,</hi> and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto him the Air about <hi>New-market.</hi> He went therefore and lived with the <hi>Lady Thornton,</hi> who had a Seat within a little more than a <hi>Mile</hi> of that Town; and God was pleased very <hi>much</hi> to <hi>bless</hi> that Air unto his Recovery; so that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten a little <hi>strength,</hi> he was resolved to <hi>return</hi> to his <hi>work,</hi> and to lay it out about his <hi>Masters Service;</hi> which he did do for near <hi>two years</hi> space.</p>
               <p>Then it pleased God to exercise him with a <hi>greater trial;</hi> for upon a <hi>Lords-day</hi> morning, in his passage from his won House towards the Parish Church, he went <note place="margin">He is hurt by a Fall.</note> over a <hi>Gate</hi> in his way (which he supposed had been <hi>locked,</hi> as it was wont to be) but while he was almost <hi>over it,</hi> the Gate opened, and caused him to have a very great <hi>fall</hi> upon his Belly against the Ground, so that his Navel <hi>started</hi> out very <hi>much,</hi> and a very great Swelling followed upon it. His <hi>affectionate</hi> Wife beseeched him (thereupon) to return home, and <hi>betake</hi> himself to his <hi>Bed;</hi> but he considering that his Congregation was at that time met, and <hi>waited</hi> to hear the Word from his <hi>mouth;</hi> and finding that he was able still to <hi>walk,</hi> (although not without pain) he went <hi>forward</hi> to Church, and there Preached the <hi>former</hi> part of that day, but was forced to procure a supply for the <hi>Afternoon.</hi> The next day his pain <hi>increased</hi> more and more; and although he loved not to keep his Bed, yet he was <hi>confined</hi> thereto for some days, and unto his Chamber for some Weeks, until he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a <hi>Truss,</hi> which inabled him to Travel on Foot; but wholly hindered him from riding on <hi>Horse-back</hi> for several years. Which <hi>affliction,</hi> though it was very <hi>uncomfortable,</hi> in as much as it barr'd him from that Recreation he only delighted in; yet his not being able to Ride, was a sufficient Plea for his not appearing at the <hi>Bishops Court;</hi> and thereby it was <hi>providentially</hi> a means of his continuing in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial work, longer than probably he might <hi>otherwise</hi> have done.</p>
               <p>For (about this time) the <hi>Book of Sports</hi> was injoined to be read, and many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations <note place="margin">He is cited to the Court at <hi>Bury.</hi>
                  </note> were creeping into the <hi>Church,</hi> which he neither did nor could submit to; and for this he was <hi>often</hi> cited to appear before the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> and <hi>Commissary</hi> at <hi>Bury:</hi> But return and answer was <hi>always</hi> given, that by reason of his <hi>Distemper</hi> he was unable to <hi>Ride</hi> so far. Hereupon <hi>Articles</hi> were drawn up against him; and the <hi>Commissary</hi> had order to <hi>Adjourn</hi> the Court from <hi>Bury,</hi> to the <hi>Parsonage house</hi> of <hi>Ketton;</hi> and now all persons feared that he would have been <hi>suspended,</hi> both <hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio;</hi> but the providence of God <hi>prevented</hi> it; for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary</hi> and <hi>Surrogate</hi> (who were deputed to examine him) were both hindered at that time by <hi>sickness,</hi> and none came but the <hi>Secretary,</hi> and one <hi>Minister with him,</hi> who did <hi>little more</hi> than take cognizance of his bodily <hi>lameness,</hi> and then departed; leaving him in <hi>liberty</hi> to go on in his <hi>work</hi> as formerly he had done; in which he was very diligent and constant; for although he was not <hi>well able</hi> to get up into the <hi>Pulpit</hi> for some years, yet he never <hi>failed,</hi> but <hi>always</hi> Preached twice every Lords-day, sitting in his <hi>Desk,</hi> and from thence delivering <hi>the lively Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But over much study (after some time) had almost brought his first <hi>Distemper</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">His Distemper doth return.</note> him; for his <hi>Spirits</hi> began to decay, and Dizziness began to seize his Head, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the continuing of the starting of his Navel) about which having consulted with many <hi>Doctors,</hi> they all advised that he would go down in a <hi>Horse-litter</hi> to the <hi>Bath,</hi> which they counted would be a most proper and effectual remedy for him upon all accounts. But such a long Journey required <hi>more time</hi> than the Statute doth allow to any <hi>Incumbent</hi> to be absent from his place; this therefore put him upon Petitioning to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> for a <hi>Dispensation;</hi> which partly by <hi>money,</hi> and partly by <hi>Interest of Friends,</hi> was obtained. And it may be remembred, that one <hi>argument</hi> which the presenter of the said <hi>Petition</hi> used to the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> was this, to wit, That his <hi>Lordship</hi> had no man dwelling in his whole <hi>Province</hi> who was so like himself, as to <hi>bodily shape and face;</hi> but none more <hi>unlike</hi> his <hi>Lordship</hi> in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and opinion: To which the <hi>Archbishop</hi> answered, is it so? Then let him go to the <hi>Bath,</hi> or whether he please, <hi>for all me;</hi> and so granted his Petition.</p>
               <p>If any person (upon this occasion) shall desire to have some account of his <note place="margin">His bodily shape and form.</note>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>his bodily shape and form,</hi> let them know, he was a pretty <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>corpulent</hi> man, <hi>full-faced,</hi> of a <hi>grave majestick aspect,</hi> and had a very <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>piercing Eye;</hi> but withal but <hi>low of stature:</hi> The greatest Wits have lodged in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies, and the <hi>bravest Spirits</hi> have been those that have been least <hi>clogged with Flesh. Varro</hi> saith of <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> and <hi>Marcius Maximus,</hi> that they were men
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62667:120"/> but <hi>two Cubits high:</hi> I am sure that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> it self did give the <hi>great Apostle</hi> a title of <hi>real honour,</hi> borrowed from the <hi>lowness of his Stature.</hi> In short, he did wear <hi>ingenium acutum in decente vagina, a sharp wit</hi> in a <hi>comely body,</hi> although the <hi>Structure</hi> was not <hi>high</hi> or <hi>lofty,</hi> yet it was every where <hi>richly furnished;</hi> and the <hi>low</hi> Fabrick was <hi>excellently</hi> Tenanted.</p>
               <p>This Dispensation aforesaid, being obtained, he resolved to undertake his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Bath,</hi> so soon as ever God should give his Wife safe Deliverance, she being <note place="margin">His Wife dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> then with Child: but this time never came; for his Wife (not going her full time) fell in Labour, and brought forth an Abortive Child, which also cost her her own Life.</p>
               <p>Great had been his Affection to her at <hi>all times,</hi> he <hi>striving</hi> to <hi>imitate</hi> at least (if <note place="margin">He is blamed for his great sorrow for such a pious relation.</note> not equal) if possible, his Lord and Master <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> in his love to his Church. But now the good mans affection did (in the opinion of some) a little <hi>degenerate,</hi> and turn into unruly passion; and truly if in any thing this holy person did deserve any reproof, it was in this, to wit, That his <hi>grief</hi> for the loss of this <hi>Relation,</hi> did a little <hi>too much</hi> deject him. He seemed indeed to err in his love; and some that watched for his <hi>halting,</hi> were glad that they could spy a <hi>colour</hi> or <hi>pretence</hi> to accuse him for this his <hi>over sorrow,</hi> as they called it. But he had many things to say in his own <hi>defence;</hi> besides that, it is the common discovery of a <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>good</hi> nature, and of an <hi>affectionate</hi> disposition, to be much <hi>affected,</hi> when <hi>the delight of a mans eyes,</hi> and the daily companion of his <hi>sorrows</hi> and <hi>joys,</hi> of his <hi>travel</hi> and <hi>rest,</hi> is taken from him. And are there not many Instances in Scripture of great affliction of heart for the loss of Relations? How did <hi>Jacob</hi> lament for his Son <hi>Joseph?</hi> How did <hi>David</hi> mourn for his <hi>Absalom?</hi> How did the Saints in <hi>the</hi> 9. <hi>Acts,</hi> bewail the death of <hi>Dorcas?</hi> And how did St. <hi>Austin</hi> weep for the holy <hi>Monica?</hi> This Wife was a <hi>non-such,</hi> a mirrour of Grace and Virtue, a person of great <hi>parts,</hi> great <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and great <hi>piety.</hi> She was very beautiful and lovely in person, and of a most obliging <hi>Conversation, cloathed with humility,</hi> and adorned with all the <hi>graces</hi> of the Divine Spirit. A careful Instructer of her Children, and a <hi>pattern</hi> of Piety to them, walking <hi>closely</hi> with God all the day, in their <hi>view.</hi> In her Husbands <hi>absence</hi> she constantly prayed <hi>twice</hi> every day in her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>mily; and she prayed always <hi>thrice</hi> a day in her Closet, twice by her self, and once with her Children. It must needs make a deeper wound than ordinary, for an Husband to lose such a Wife. He must needs weep for his own loss, and more for his Childrens. What the Poet said of <hi>Peleus,</hi> That he could bear any affliction while <hi>Thetis</hi> his Wife was with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she always bore the <hi>weightiest</hi> burden, and the biggest end of the <hi>Log;</hi> this might be applied to them both. But now he is lest alone with a great number of <hi>small Children,</hi> and with a great Family of <hi>Servants;</hi> the <hi>education</hi> of the one, and the <hi>government</hi> of the other, was impossible for him to discharge, (as he knew that it ought to be done) by reason, that his <hi>Ministerial</hi> work did necessarily take up the most of his time, if not all of it. Yet he grappled with these difficulties <hi>for three years,</hi> and was then perswaded by Friends, to <hi>endeavour</hi> to repair the <hi>breach</hi> which God had made in his Family, by marrying a <hi>second time.</hi>

This <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> was a person of great <hi>Piety,</hi> and of a <hi>sweet</hi> disposition; she was the Relict of Mr. <hi>William Folke</hi> of <hi>Cambridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> and had but <hi>only one</hi> Child, a Daughter, an <hi>Heiress</hi> of a fair Estate; who was much of the same Age with his youngest Child and Daughter. After much prayer and seeking of God, the thing was <hi>accomplished,</hi> to the great joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them both; she being a very affectionate <hi>Yoke fellow</hi> to him, and a most <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent</hi> Mother-in-Law to his <hi>Children;</hi> so that there never happened the least strife between them, but only this, Whether he should shew more kindness to her <hi>only</hi> Child, or she shew more love to all his <hi>seven Children?</hi> and this contest <hi>also</hi> was most <hi>pleasingly</hi> composed afterwards, by the inter-marriage of his third Son with that Daughter. <note place="margin">He is nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be one of the Synod at <hi>Westminster,</hi> but declineth it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>first</hi> long Parliament <hi>convened,</hi> who after a while, <hi>thought</hi> fit to call an Assembly of the most <hi>eminent Divines</hi> of the Nation; and those of <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> perswasions, to sit at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and to consult about making some alteration
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62667:121"/> in the <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the Church. His Patron being one of the <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Shire</hi> for <hi>Suffolk,</hi> did then nominate him to be one of this Assembly. But although he had very much recovered his <hi>health</hi> by Gods blessing (without going to the <hi>Bath)</hi> yet the <hi>starting</hi> of his <hi>Navel</hi> was not so fully cured, but that he did come very <hi>seldom</hi> on Horse-back; and therefore he went not to <hi>London</hi> till that Assembly was <hi>met,</hi> and had sat some time; and a prospect of some <hi>differences,</hi> was given, like to <hi>arise</hi> amongst them; and the <hi>Dissenting Brethren</hi> had prepared their <hi>Apology;</hi> before he could go, to <hi>answer</hi> the Summons, which was given him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on that Service. When he came to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and observed the state of things; he Petitioned to be discharged; and obtained of his Patron, to nominate another <hi>Suffolk</hi> Minister to succeed in his place; which being granted, he returned to his own Countrey charge. He was a great lover of Peace, and a great promoter of it; and was wont greatly to bemoan; that those who did so unanimously and heartily agree in the fundamental Articles of our Creed, and in the Doctrine of the Church, should (with great heat and animosity) contend about Modes and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Worship, and Forms of Discipline and Government.</p>
               <p>In the year 1645. a very great number of persons in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Suffolk</hi> were <note place="margin">He is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned to sit on the Beneh at the Trial of a great number of Witches.</note> apprehended, as being <hi>guilty</hi> of the damnable and Diabolical sin of <hi>Witchcraft;</hi> and divers of them had <hi>confessed</hi> themselves guilty thereof; but a report was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the <hi>Parliament</hi> then sitting, as if some busie men had made use of some <hi>ill Arts,</hi> to extort <hi>such confession</hi> from them; thereupon a special Commission of <hi>Oyer and Terminer</hi> was granted for the Trial of these <hi>Witches;</hi> in which Commission Mr. <hi>Fairclough</hi>'s name was inserted, with the name of another <hi>Reverend</hi> Divine; these were <hi>joined</hi> in Commission with the <hi>Judge of Assize,</hi> and the <hi>Justices of Peace</hi> of the County; that there might be a most <hi>special care</hi> taken, both of the <hi>executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and that also all <hi>tenderness</hi> might be used, in a matter wherein the Lives and immortal Souls of many were <hi>concerned.</hi> The Statute it self (in that case) is so worded, that none can be <hi>convicted</hi> thereupon, but <hi>such</hi> as are <hi>proved</hi> to have made either an <hi>express</hi> compact with the Devil, or an <hi>implicite one,</hi> by imploying Imps, that is, the <hi>Devils instruments,</hi> to the hurt of their Neighbours, in <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Estate.</hi> Hence it comes to pass, that it is very <hi>difficult</hi> to Convict any person upon this <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> but such as shall consess <hi>themselves</hi> guilty; and now great care was <hi>taken,</hi> that such <hi>confession</hi> should be purely <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>unconstrained;</hi> and the truth thereof might also be <hi>evidenced</hi> by many <hi>collateral</hi> circumstances, and other <hi>concurring</hi> and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing evidence. This Learned man therefore, before his first sitting upon the <hi>Bench,</hi> did Preach <hi>two</hi> Sermons to the <hi>Court</hi> in <hi>Bury</hi> Church; wherein he <hi>first</hi> shewed, that there was such a sin as that of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> that is, of mens <hi>dealing and contracting with</hi> familiar Spirits; and did then <hi>confute</hi> all those <hi>arguments,</hi> which either former or later, <hi>Sadducees</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> have produced to the <hi>contrary;</hi> wherein he gave <hi>great satisfaction</hi> to the whole Auditory. He afterwards shewed the <hi>hainousness</hi> of the sin of those, who would violently prosecute, or unduly endeavonr to <hi>convict</hi> any person, except <hi>plain convincing</hi> evidence could be brought. These Sermons were of <hi>great use;</hi> and although it is <hi>possible</hi> that <hi>some</hi> that were <hi>guilty</hi> might escape for want of such evidence, yet sure it is, that none were <hi>condemned,</hi> who could be <hi>saved</hi> without an <hi>express breach</hi> of the Law; for both in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and on the <hi>Bench,</hi> he did very much <hi>influence</hi> the whole Court by his <hi>judgment, viz.</hi> by his learned, pious and prudent <hi>management</hi> of the whole affair.</p>
               <p>In all <hi>imployments,</hi> and in every <hi>trust</hi> committed to him, he shewed and <hi>approved</hi> himself a man of great <hi>Learning, prudence</hi> and <hi>integrity.</hi> Through his <hi>whole</hi> life, <hi>no blemish</hi> (upon any account <hi>whatsoever)</hi> did fall upon his Reputation; except <hi>that</hi> which is common to all men, to wit, such as is the result of <hi>envy,</hi> and hammer'd in the forge of <hi>malice</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>He was no <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and therefore might be ignorant of the <hi>legality</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of either party, during the late <hi>Civil Wars;</hi> and therefore he always chose <note place="margin">His lamenting the Civil Wars.</note> to be <hi>passive</hi> therein rather than <hi>active;</hi> but no man <hi>lamented</hi> more the sins of those times than <hi>he did,</hi> being greatly <hi>wounded</hi> when he heard of so much <hi>blood</hi> as was shed by <hi>Protestants,</hi> their fighting <hi>one</hi> against <hi>another.</hi> That <hi>expression</hi> of St. <hi>Cyp. de Sim. Prelat.</hi> was often then in his mouth, <hi>Proh dolor! quid facit, in corde Christianorum, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum feritas &amp; Canum rabies?</hi> The Wars were no sooner <hi>began,</hi> but he foretold the ruine both of <hi>Church and State</hi> thereby; for he discerned the designs of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> were, to <hi>foment</hi> the differences on <hi>both</hi> sides, till both <hi>Church and State should</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:62667:121"/> be destroyed; which sadly came to pass in the year 1648. when the <hi>Emissaries</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (who had Listed themselves in both Armies) did so influence and leaven their Counsels, that the one Army <hi>rebell'd</hi> against the <hi>very persons</hi> from whom they received their Commissions, and offered great violence to them; first by <hi>excluding</hi> the most <hi>eminent</hi> Members of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> with the whole <hi>House of Lords;</hi> and then killed the <hi>King himself</hi> at his own door; throwing the <hi>scandal</hi> of all, upon the Protestants; though a Learned <hi>Dignitary of the Church</hi> hath abundantly proved it to be the act of the Papists chiefly.</p>
               <p>Oh how greatly did the Soul of this worthy person bleed within himself for these things, and upon all occasions he constantly bore the publick testimony against those proceedings; which he mourned for deeply.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Engagement</hi> for excluding the Kings Posterity was imposed upon him, <note place="margin">He refuseth the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all Preferments of those days.</note> upon the penalty of forfeiting his Living, he declared, That he would not only part with his Living, but with his Life also, rather than subscribe to that which his Soul abhorred. He was sometimes threatned (on the one hand) with Loss; at other times tempted by great offers of Gain: but nothing could prevail with him, to bring him to a <hi>compliance</hi> in any thing which he judged sinful. There was a <hi>Baronet,</hi> who being a great Friend of his, (and a great man in those days, being related to the <hi>Protector himself)</hi> had long waited to <hi>express his kindness</hi> to him, (whose Preaching he valued above all mens) and it so happened, that the <hi>Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Trinity Colledge,</hi> which was one of the greatest Preferments (for a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) in <hi>England,</hi> fell void by the death of Dr. <hi>Hill;</hi> the Baronet (without his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in the least) obtained a grant thereof for him, and offer'd it to him, but he would not accept it; which when his Friend pressed him to, he first repeated to him the <hi>Dystich</hi> of the Learned <hi>Funcius.</hi>

               <p>And withal he told the Knight this Story of <hi>Funcius,</hi> That he being a private Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, was once invited to Preach at Court; which he performing well, he was intreated to stay there; and a while after he was preferred to be a <hi>Minister of State</hi> to his Prince: but thereby he soon made himself many enemies and enviers, and incurred the malice of many Courtiers; who after a little time, procured Articles to be exhibited against him, and so got him to be condemned to Death; which he suffered: but left the <hi>former Verses.</hi> for a warning to all future <hi>ambitious</hi> persons.</p>
               <p>Our prudent and humble Divine had it deeply <hi>engraven</hi> on his heart, for he <note place="margin">He loved a private Life of Study and Preaching so well, as he avoided (as much as he could) the best other Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> highly approved that common saying, <hi>viz.

This caused him to be greatly loved; and highly honoured by all men; some of whom are yet alive, and are dignified in the Church; who (afterwards) offered to have procured preferment for him, could he have <hi>departed</hi> from the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>path</hi> which he had chosen to take.</p>
               <p>But he was <hi>semperidem,</hi> always fixed as a Rock, to those <hi>Principles</hi> which (after <note place="margin">He was sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast to his principles.</note> long <hi>deliberation,</hi> much <hi>reading,</hi> and full <hi>disquisition)</hi> he had <hi>established</hi> in his Soul; and upon this account he loved heartily those that even differ'd from him, when he once perceived that they were men of <hi>Conscience;</hi> and were not tempted by any <hi>outward</hi> interest whatsoever. He suspected men who were of the temper of him who was a Papist in <hi>King Harry</hi>'s days, a Protestant in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist again in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s, and a Protestant again in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's. Josephus</hi> tells us of some <hi>Jews,</hi> that kept <hi>two different</hi> Pedigrees by them, and were <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> either <hi>favoured</hi> them, or <hi>frowned</hi> upon them. And even in the Primitive times we are told, that there were some, who were <hi>Pagans</hi> when <hi>Dioclesian</hi> was Emperour, and turned Christians in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time; but the same men were <hi>Arians</hi> when <hi>Constantius</hi> Reigned, and became <hi>Pagans</hi> again with <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate.</p>
               <p>He always pitied men in temptation, but valued those that were most stedfast, <hi>bewailing</hi> others, that thought it ground enough to change because the times changed; such as could say (without shame) <hi>Eamus ad communem errorem,</hi> Let us do the evil that most do; of whom it hath been said, <hi>Purpuram coluerunt non Deum:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was of another temper; and being always stedfast, it might be said of him, even what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith of some Christians in his time, That their Faith was strong, even <hi>inter ipsas seculi ruinas. Cvp. Ep. ad Demet.</hi> and like St. <hi>Basil,</hi> who being allured by the Prefect to change his Opinion, made answer, That he would not part with one syllable of Truth, no not to save his Life.</p>
               <p>After near <hi>fifty years</hi> spent in Preaching the Word of God with <hi>faithfulness</hi> and <note place="margin">He cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, by help of a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commonly used.</note>

               <p>Neither were they <hi>little things</hi> which he scrupled, or <hi>suffer'd for</hi> not doing of <note place="margin">He suffered not for small things, or such as were dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his Opinion.</note> them.

In short, he judged it to be to him a sin, to say, he liked that which his heart was far from any <hi>approbation</hi> of.</p>
               <p>All his people were greatly desirous of his <hi>continuing</hi> with them, if his <hi>Conscience</hi>

The Poor thought they should greatly suffer by his leaving them; fearing a want of that Charity and Bounty which he was wont to extend towards them. Others thought of their great loss of an able and willing <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,</hi> in case of differences and quarrels, (all which he always took up) for he <hi>made</hi> and <hi>kept</hi> agreement, <hi>as much as possible,</hi> between his Neighbours. Others doubted, that in his absence they should want a person that would appear for the <hi>Fatherless and Widdow,</hi> against their injurious Enemies, and cruel Oppressors; which he never failed to do. All these forenamed might desire his continuance out of love to themselves; but others came to him out of a principle of true humane Friendship (as they thought it to be) <hi>to him and to his;</hi> advising him to be kind to himself, and not to lose such a Living of 200 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> or to part with such a fine Parsonage house, or with such a fine Glebe, or with such a great Auditory, or with such a loving People, or kind Neighbourhood: And others did desire his continuance yet upon <hi>more weighty</hi> reasons; they questioned whether any would <hi>succeed, like-minded with him, who naturally had taken care of their Souls;</hi> by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mysteries of the Gospel, and by revealing the way of Life to them, and that with great <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>demonstration,</hi> with great <hi>power</hi> and <hi>plainness;</hi> they doubted also, whether they should ever have such another <hi>pattern</hi> of <hi>holiness,</hi> or such an <hi>example</hi> of <hi>mortification,</hi> or such an <hi>instance</hi> of <hi>heavenly mindedness</hi> set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes again in this world: To all these, <hi>he replyed diversly.</hi> To the <hi>poor afflicted</hi> and <hi>oppressed,</hi> he answered, That he blessed God that he should leave a <hi>good Magistrate</hi> behind him in the Town; who had formerly done (and could still do) more for them than he could, in that kind; and he knew that he was <hi>ready so to do.</hi> To the second sort he answered, That their love <hi>was great,</hi> but not right, being of no <hi>other kind</hi> than that of <hi>Peters,</hi> when he disswaded Christ from going to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and therefore he desired them to desist from tempting him. To the last sort he used the words of the Apostle, <hi>Sirs, Why do you break my heart, for my own part I am not willing to be bound, but to die, rather than sin against the light of my Conscience;</hi> and for you I shall not <hi>cease to pray,</hi> That God would send you <hi>another Pastor; one after his own heart;</hi> and I hope God will hear me herein, and will direct your Landlord in the choice of such a one. He desired them therefore to join with the <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>himself,</hi> in <hi>setting some time apart to seek God</hi> upon that account; <hi>which they did:</hi> and he did also in private, give himself earnestly to beg of God that he might have <hi>such a successor,</hi> as that <hi>he himself might not be wanted;</hi> imitating herein the good and just <hi>Aristides,</hi> who being <hi>banished unjustly</hi> from <hi>Athens,</hi> prayed this Petition only, That his <hi>counsel</hi> and <hi>direction</hi> might not be <hi>wanted</hi> by that City at any time thereafter.</p>
               <p>Indeed, upon the <hi>removal</hi> of so eminent a person, it could be no easie thing for the Patron, to provide a man who might bear <hi>any proportion</hi> to him who had left <note place="margin">The Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds him.</note> them; an universal search <hi>(in both the Ʋniversities,</hi> and in the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Countrey)</hi> was made, for a man that might rise up in his place, and might tread in his steps. At length the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> was recommended to the Patron as a person of <hi>great worth and abilities,</hi> a man of a <hi>moderate</hi> and <hi>candid</hi> Spirit, and of a <hi>large</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> temper; <hi>to him</hi> therefore was the Presentation given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much of the loss was repaired; it being also no <hi>small ease</hi> to their former <hi>Ministers heart,</hi> that a man of <hi>that worth</hi> did succeed him.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His removal to <hi>Finching-field,</hi> where himself and four of his Sons do cohabit as in a Colledge.</note> but their <hi>Parishes</hi> and <hi>People</hi> also, cameforth, this grieved him <hi>far more</hi> than the <hi>loss of his Living;</hi> for this <hi>hindered</hi> him, not only from <hi>Preaching</hi> to, but <hi>conversing</hi> with many of <hi>his Spiritual Children,</hi> whose <hi>education</hi> and <hi>increase of Grace,</hi> was dearer to him than any <hi>temporal</hi> concern. But where <hi>active obedience</hi> cannot be given, <hi>passive obedience</hi> must be shewn; he therefore resolved upon a remove; and the <hi>first place</hi> he went to, was to board with his <hi>eldest</hi> Daughter, who had married an <hi>Essex Gentleman,</hi> who lived in a very fair large House, called <hi>Sculpons in Finchingfield.</hi> He had also
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62667:124"/> two Sons, and two <hi>Sons-in-law,</hi> who were all Ministers, and had left their Livings also; the Father (and these his four Sons) had lived at great distance from each other, in five several Counties of <hi>England;</hi> but now they all <hi>agreed</hi> to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one House, which made a very numerous Family, and erected a kind of <hi>little Colledge</hi> of <hi>Divines;</hi> it was as a constellation of Stars, every one whereof had <hi>afforded</hi> a very <hi>fair</hi> light when it was <hi>separate</hi> and <hi>alone;</hi> but being now <hi>all in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,</hi> they drew the Eyes of much People (in that Corner) <hi>upon them.</hi> Neither could so many <hi>Candles</hi> be <hi>so put under a Bed, or under a Bushel,</hi> but that they still yielded a most benigne influence to all those parts. Their <hi>habitation</hi> was about two Miles from the <hi>Parish Church,</hi> unto which (though some of the Family sometimes went) yet it was <hi>impossible</hi> for the <hi>whole Family</hi> to repair thither, especially for the <hi>aged</hi> among them, who were more than <hi>one or two.</hi> For</p>
               <p>This <hi>aged</hi> person was forced to marry (a <hi>third time)</hi> an aged <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> to be his <note place="margin">Their Family exercise.</note> Nurse in his old Age, (his second Wife living a very few years with him) more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the <hi>House-keeper</hi> had an <hi>own Mother</hi> above <hi>threescore and ten years old,</hi> who lived with him. Upon the account therefore of these persons, and also of divers Children in the Family (whose tender years kept them also from the publick) the Father and his Sons, did engage to Preach constantly on <hi>the Lords-day</hi> in their turns, and once or twice on the <hi>week</hi> days in the Family, whither some <hi>Neighbours</hi> also did repair. Great was the comfort and joy, which the Father and his Children, took in each others Company. It was a most happy Family, and a very delightful Society.</p>
               <p>But to the great grief of all, it continued not thus above four or five years: for <note place="margin">A pieasant So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> although the Seat was (otherwise) very <hi>pleasant,</hi> yet the Air was bad, and proved very <hi>unwholsome,</hi> which caused a dispersion of the <hi>whole</hi> Family. His <hi>own</hi> Sons then removed to <hi>London,</hi> and his two Sons-in-Law into <hi>high Suffolk;</hi> and himself went and boarded with his youngest Son, who was then a publick Preacher at <hi>Kennet</hi> in <hi>Cambridge-shire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Father did constantly go every Lords-day to Church (it being near) <note place="margin">He doth Preach in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and hears in publick.</note> and heard his Son, and usually Preached himself every Lords-day Evening in the Family. He was then <hi>near fourscore years</hi> old, yet his parts continued <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>strong;</hi> and although aged, yet he still retained much of the <hi>Smartness</hi> and <hi>vigour</hi> of his youth. The blade was metal to the back, and although it was much worn, yet it kept its <hi>keenness</hi> to the last. Those that stood without doors, and saw not his Face, might suppose the Preacher to be about fifty years old, or a man arrived at the <hi>achme</hi> of his excellency, and standing in the <hi>Zenith</hi> of his Noon-day glory, and that both as to the <hi>matter</hi> of his Discourses, and the <hi>manner</hi> of his Delivery. Although at this Age, he would often say, That he now might be discharged of his <hi>labour,</hi> both by the Laws of God and Men (the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law allowing the <hi>Levite</hi> at Fifty, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Law allowing the Soldier at Sixty, to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He lived at <hi>Kennet</hi> (with this Son) some years, where his last Wife died; she <note place="margin">His last Wife dies.</note> was the Daughter of Mr. <hi>Sorrel</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the Relict of a Reverend Minister <hi>formerly</hi> in that County; but she having never had any Children of her own, she was unacquainted with true <hi>Parental</hi> affection, the want whereof in her, was <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> both to him and his; yet she was a good woman otherwise, and loved his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Ministry.</hi>

All his Children (when grown up, and many of the <hi>Servants</hi> who lived with him) could not only answer every question in a very large Catechism, but could prove every answer by express <hi>Scripture Texts;</hi> for they answered not like <hi>Parrots,</hi> but as understanding the <hi>sum and substance of Christian Religion.</hi> He moved in his Family as an <hi>Angel,</hi> or an <hi>Intelligence</hi> in his <hi>Orb,</hi> ruling of it with perfect <hi>harmony</hi> and <hi>decorum.</hi> He beheld his <hi>Yoke-fellow</hi> with a pleasing, and pleased Eye of love; he looked on his Children with an Eye of <hi>watchfulness,</hi> as well as <hi>affection,</hi> and upon his Servants with an Eye of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> so that all things were dispatched in his House, with Peace and Order.</p>
               <p>He would tell his Servants, that he hired them, first to be Gods Servants, and <note place="margin">He is a good Master.</note> then his; and required them to look <hi>through</hi> and <hi>beyond him,</hi> unto God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might do <hi>two</hi> works, and serve <hi>two</hi> Masters (the one subordinate to the other) at once, and that they might be sure, that they should receive thereby dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wages, from God and from him; adding withal, that God may (by an holy person) be as truly served in dressing of an Horse, or milking of a Cow (in time and place fit, and in Obedience to God) as in their going to Church, or as in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Prayer. He was careful in hiring of Servants, (which few are) if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, he would gain the Children of <hi>godly Parents;</hi> and would never permit any to serve him, who refused to serve God in any of his <hi>Institutions.</hi> He reproved Idleness, as well in <hi>Soul concerns</hi> as in <hi>houshold-affairs,</hi> and carefully rewarded the improvers of time. When he happened upon any Servant of mean capacity, and a weak memory, he would give his Children charge to take so much the more pains with them, and be always very patient and gentle towards them. And God was pleased to bless him with many <hi>godly</hi> Servants, and such as were most faithful to him.</p>
               <p>He had one Servant that managed all his concerns without doors, a Servant <note place="margin">And is blessed with an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent faithful Servant.</note> very skilful, and very careful; to whom his Master once saying thus: <hi>John,</hi> Since I have left my Estate to your care, I must own, that God hath greatly <hi>blessed me;</hi> and I perceive, the less that I do meddle with the World, the more I do thrive; the more I give away, the more I have at the years end.

               <p>He lived in an Age wherein great <hi>contempt</hi> was thrown upon the Office of the <note place="margin">His esteem of the Office of the Ministry, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all his Sons thereto.</note> Ministry; this caused this <hi>Champion</hi> to appear both <hi>Doctrinally</hi> and <hi>Practically</hi> against such contemners of the <hi>institution of Christ.</hi> By his Doctrine he declared often, and proved, that neither <hi>gifts</hi> nor <hi>graces, single and separate</hi> one from the other, did fully qualifie persons for this work, nor doth the <hi>conjunction</hi> of them <hi>constitute</hi> a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Officer in the Church, without due <hi>approbation</hi> by <hi>Church-Officers</hi> (upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination) and Ordination (after Approbation) if possibly it can be obtained. Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically be appeared against such <hi>Contemners;</hi> first, by the <hi>begging</hi> earnestly of God, that he would give Grace unto all his Sons; and then would incline the hearts of them all to devote themselves to this <hi>work.</hi> Secondly, By his administring all the helps and furtherances of <hi>Education</hi> that might qualifie them thereto. And to shew <hi>yet more</hi> his esteem of this Office, he married <hi>two of his Daughters</hi> unto Ministers; and farther, he did not only send his <hi>own</hi> Sons to the University, but he sent divers <hi>others</hi> thither also, and maintained some of them much at his <hi>own</hi> charge; and he also prevailed with his <hi>own</hi> Sons (after they were Fellows of Colledges) to assist him <note place="margin">He sends di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and he and his own Sons takes care for their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</note> therein; which they constantly did do.</p>
               <p>There are divers <hi>Ministers</hi> yet alive that will <hi>acknowledge,</hi> that unto some of them he was the <hi>sole founder,</hi> and many others confess him their greatest Benefactor, as to the University maintenance.</p>
               <p>He once hired a young man (of about twenty years old) to wait on him, and to Ride abroad with him, who was a good School-Scholar; but his Parents wanted an
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62667:126"/> Estate to send him to <hi>Cambridge:</hi> this his Master was ignorant of at his first coming, but a while after, accidentally observing him to be reading in the <hi>Greek</hi> Testament, he posed him therein, and in other Books, and finding him fit, sent him <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> to his <hi>eldest</hi> Son in the University, and provided for his <hi>sustenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At another time, he Preached a worthy Ministers <hi>Funeral</hi> Sermon, who had fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his eldest Son for <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but he died Poor; whereby the Son <hi>despaired</hi> of proceeding on in his <hi>Learning;</hi> which he being made then <hi>acquainted</hi> with, at the <hi>close</hi> of the Funeral Sermon, he desired all those of his <hi>Auditors</hi> that loved and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued the deceased pious Minister; that they would testifie their affection in <hi>contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting</hi> towards the yearly <hi>maintenance</hi> of his Son; and after Sermon was ended, he called divers <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Yeomandry</hi> together; and first he himself subscribed <hi>four pound per annum;</hi> the Gentlemen then subscribed <hi>Forty shillings per annum,</hi> and some Yeomandry <hi>Twenty;</hi> so that the young Scholar was <hi>provided</hi> for at the University, as <hi>comfortably</hi> as could be desired; and he proved very <hi>useful</hi> in the Church of God afterwards.</p>
               <p>He was an excellent Oratour upon all accounts; but he would use, and shew it most <hi>effectually;</hi> when he was desired to move his Auditory to be <hi>charitable;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occasions whereof, were offered to him: and he did willingly embrace them.</p>
               <p>When the Plague was once in the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He sends 50 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> at the request of the Vice-Chancellour, during a time of Pestilence.</note> thereof sent to him (and some other Neighbour Ministers) to make a Collection in his Congregation for the Town of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> which he did do, so <hi>effectually,</hi> that he sent him above <hi>Fifty pound</hi> within a few days after. And the <hi>Vice-Chancellour</hi> wrote him a long Latine Letter of thanks; calling his gift <hi>Pingue beneficium, a fat Sacrifice;</hi> and withal told him, that his gift was more, than he had received from any six Towns in all the County besides.</p>
               <p>At another time, when the Plague was at <hi>Hadleigh in Suffolk,</hi> he gathered near as <note place="margin">The like to <hi>Hadleigh,</hi> when the Plague was there.</note> much for that Town also. At which time, he did not only perswade the good people, but even compelled (as it were) many <hi>covetous Ʋsurers</hi> to be bountiful; as the Prophet <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 13. The case of the Prophet, was that of Famine, and this case, was that of the Plague; yet he thought, that both the words and the action also of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> might well be applied hereunto; and used them (in this case) with the like effect; many <hi>hard-hearted</hi> persons professing, that when he shook his Garment (as the Prophet did) at that very action their hearts melted within them; and they <hi>so trembled,</hi> that had their Pockets been then full, they had given it all to him at that Collection.</p>
               <p>At another time, a Neighbour Ministers House being <hi>burned down,</hi> wherein his Goods (and the greatest part of the <hi>fairest Library</hi> in the County) being consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he in a short time, procured him above an <hi>hundred pounds</hi> towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of his loss; and procured also <hi>his own third Son</hi> (then <hi>Fellow</hi> of <hi>Gonvile</hi> and <hi>Cajus Colledge)</hi> to take the <hi>distressed Ministers eldest Son,</hi> to be his Pupil, and to allow him good part of his <hi>maintenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was Charitable beyond compare, both to the Souls and Bodies of men; both <note place="margin">His stated Charity.</note>
                  <hi>mediately</hi> (by interceding with others for them) and <hi>immediately,</hi> by contributing and distributing of his <hi>own plentifully</hi> to them; and that, not only occasionally, but statedly. He commanded all the Poor of his Parish to come, Weekly, to his door for <hi>relief;</hi> and required always that his <hi>eldest Daughter</hi> (first, before she married, then his next Daughters successively) should be his stated Almoners, and should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute Alms with their own hands; accustoming themselves to works of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>charity:</hi> wherein he commanded them to be very bountiful. Vast was the sum of money which he gave away with his <hi>own hand.</hi> He cloathed the <hi>naked,</hi> and fed the <hi>hungry.</hi> He put not only many young men to <hi>Cambridge</hi> (as hath been said) but many poor Children to School. He gave away, as many <hi>Bibles, Catechisms</hi> and <hi>good Books,</hi> as were asked of him; and they were many. When the sight of old People was decayed, he would furnish them with Bibles of a larger Print; and he gave an incredible number of Spectacles away (for their help) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways speaking of the Invention of them by <hi>Metius,</hi> with expressions of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> unto God, for his great <hi>goodness</hi> to the Souls of men thereby.</p>
               <p>He loved all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi> of Jesus Christ. Preaching was his <note place="margin">His love to all the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Christ.</note>
                  <hi>delight,</hi> Prayer his <hi>joy,</hi> Administration of Sacraments, the <hi>pleasure</hi> of his Soul. He counted the <hi>Sabbath honourable.</hi> He was most solemn in the observation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62667:126"/> days of Humiliation; and kept many days of private <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> by himself alone in his Study. But above all, he delighted in reading the Scriptures; which was always <hi>sweeter to him than the Honey, or the Honey-comb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He would never engage in the performance of any Ordinances <hi>rashly,</hi> or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">His prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for every Duty, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinance.</note> due <hi>preparation.</hi> For his own part, he would never read a Chapter, or rarely suffer a Chapter to be read in his presence, without invocating God, for the <hi>co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the Divine Spirit therewith. His preparation for solemn days of Fasting, for the Sanctification of the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> and for the Administration of the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> is not to be <hi>paralelled,</hi> as the whole Corner and Countrey where he lived, will unanimously testifie. He never kept any solemn <hi>publick Fast,</hi> but he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>some preparation Sermons</hi> before the day came. He never administred the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> but that he first Preached <hi>three or four Sermons at least,</hi> in opening, either the <hi>Institution,</hi> the <hi>nature,</hi> the <hi>use</hi> or the <hi>end</hi> thereof; or in shewing the Duties of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants before, in,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the receiving thereof. He hath left many Quires of Paper, <hi>written</hi> with his <hi>own hand</hi> upon those Subjects.</p>
               <p>His constant solemn preparation for the <hi>Lords-day</hi> is beyond all. It hath been already said, that he did constantly Preach every <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Evening, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">His preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Lords-day</note> in order to the right <hi>sanctification</hi> of that <hi>holy day;</hi> there must now only be added in short; that he commanded all his Servants to lay aside all <hi>houshold work</hi> and <hi>business</hi> early upon <hi>Saturday Evening;</hi> declaring, that he desired and hoped, That when the World was taken out of his Servants <hi>hands,</hi> they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by <hi>Prayer, Reading</hi> and <hi>Meditation,</hi> to get it out of their <hi>hearts</hi> also; that so their <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> both might be free, and ready for a most chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful performance of <hi>Gods service</hi> the day following; which work, should always be done without the least distraction of mind. This preparation was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great <hi>reason;</hi> for it is, <hi>as he would say,</hi> no easie matter to <hi>cleanse our hands, and purifie our hearts too, before we compass Gods Altar;</hi> it is not easie to <hi>lift</hi> our <hi>Feet</hi> out of the Mire and Clay, unto which, they have too much cleaved, and into which, they have too much sunk all the Week before. The <hi>Royal Preacher</hi> therefore biddeth us, <hi>to look carefully to our Feet</hi> (that is, our affections) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we enter into the House of God. Holiness becomes his House for ever;</hi> therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth us, that our Souls be <hi>comely, dressed</hi> and <hi>adorned</hi> when we wait on the great God; and that our hearts be <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>prepared,</hi> and our <hi>heart-strings screwed up,</hi> and <hi>rightly tuned,</hi> before we offer to <hi>sing and give praise</hi> to a God of infinite Glory; and all this, requireth <hi>time</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> before hand, with much diligence.</p>
               <p>Himself being thus prepared, how did this heavenly person <hi>welcome the arrival</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His joy at the approach of the Lords-day</note> of the Lords-day! which he sanctified in a manner equal to his <hi>preparation.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> call the Sabbath the <hi>Queen of days;</hi> and he loved it <hi>accordingly.</hi> He rose <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> on that day than on any other; and caused his Family so to do also: admonishing both <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> to spend sometime with God <hi>in private</hi> in the Morning, if at least they desired to <hi>meet God</hi> in the <hi>publick Ordinances</hi> of that day. The <hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and the <hi>Evening Sacrifice</hi> was by him <hi>doubled</hi> upon the Lords-day; for he always prayed <hi>four</hi> times with his Family every Sabbath (besides six times in publick) to wit, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before he went to Church, and immediately after his return from thence, in the Forenoon; and before Repetition, and after Supper, in the Evening. His <hi>Forenoon</hi> Sermon was usually repeated by <hi>one of his Children</hi> after Dinner. In the Evening he repeated it himself. After Repetition, he <hi>examin'd</hi> his whole Family, not only what they <hi>remembred</hi> of the Sermons, but what <hi>good</hi> they had gained by the <hi>worship</hi> of that day. After Supper, he caused some part of <hi>Foxe</hi>'s <hi>Martyrology</hi> (or some other profitable Book) to be read; and having prayed, he concluded the day <hi>always</hi> with singing of a <hi>Psalm.</hi>

               <p>Whatever is in the World, is either the Lust of the Eye, the Lust of the Flesh, <note place="margin">His Victory over the world by Faith.</note> or the Pride of Life; he therefore, who is mortified to Riches, Pleasures and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, hath very much vanquished the World; as he had done.</p>

He was <hi>so dead</hi> to the world, as that he would not scarce <hi>deal</hi> or <hi>meddle</hi> with it. After the death of his <hi>first Wife,</hi> and of <hi>that Servant</hi> with whom he had intrusted his Estate, he put off all his Stock, and let all his Grounds, and never increased his real Estate, or personal Estate, above Five pound <hi>per annum,</hi> for near <hi>Forty years</hi> together; and he never put out a <hi>Farthing of money to Ʋsury.</hi> He never sued any man in his Life: He had great advantages of growing <hi>rich</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways; but if he had died <hi>Forty years</hi> before he <hi>did die,</hi> he had been just so Rich as he was at his <hi>death.</hi> He would often say, that we read not of any good man in all the <hi>History of Scripture,</hi> or of the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> that was <hi>Covetous,</hi> and it was a shame, that any that do now pretend to Christian Religion, should dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.

He used to keep as good Horses as any man in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and was therefore by a dying Gentleman, bequeathed an Horse of very <hi>great price,</hi> in these words, <hi>That he might Ride on him about to Preach the Gospel;</hi> which he did do so long as he was able; but he never took a Journey of meer pleasure; except those when he visited his Children, who lived remote.</p>
               <p>He was far from <hi>ambition,</hi> as hath been already evidenced in his <hi>refusal of great</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He was far from ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or desire of Honour.</note>
                  <hi>preferments;</hi> and many more Instances thereof might have been added: He <hi>bound himself in a Bond,</hi> never to commence <hi>Doctor in Divinity;</hi> which did shew, that he was herein like St. <hi>Ambrose, Qui nihil fecit propter ardorem inanis gloriae, sed propter Charitatem felicitatis; he acted from love to God, and not for praise of men.</hi> He was great in other mens Eyes, but little in his own.</p>
               <p>Being once <hi>heartily thanked</hi> for an <hi>excellent</hi> Discourse which he made upon the 3 <hi>John</hi> 16. which Sermon proved <hi>successful</hi> to the <hi>saving Conversion</hi> of some there <note place="margin">His great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> present; and this thing being related to him, he replyed thus, <hi>Pray friend, give God the Glory;</hi> no praise was due to the <hi>Rams Horns,</hi> though <hi>Jericho</hi>'s Walls fell down at their <hi>blast;</hi> if God will vouchsafe that his <hi>Spirit shall breath through Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;</hi> it is God, and not the <hi>means,</hi> must have the <hi>praise.</hi> And another time, being greatly assisted by God in a Sermon, which he Preached in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he wrote these words on the back-side of the Notes of that Sermon, <hi>Earthen Vessels, and Leaden Pipes, are either full or empty, according to the measures which they receive from their head Spring and Fountain, though free Grace filled my Soul this day, yet let me take heed of Preaching this Sermon (again) in my own strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As his heart was humble, so his <hi>behaviour was meek and lowly.</hi> Though his <note place="margin">His behaviour grave, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable and courteous.</note> Countenance was very <hi>grave and severe,</hi> yet his Conversation was full of <hi>sweetness</hi> and <hi>affability.</hi> It was a kind of <hi>Riddle</hi> in the <hi>Eyes</hi> of common beholders, to see so much worth and grandeur to be of such <hi>easie access.</hi> He would (and all truly noble minds will do the same) stoop to the meanest person who desired his <hi>Opinion</hi> in matters of weight and moment. He never despised (or spake haughtily to) any man; and from <hi>sober good men,</hi> he would never keep any distance. If any were <hi>godly,</hi> although never so <hi>mean</hi> or <hi>poor,</hi> he received them, not only with <hi>civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi> but with <hi>hearty love;</hi> but (on the other hand) he was a most bold and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted</hi> person in reproving the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>prophane;</hi> and had a Spirit which could <hi>abase the proudest Hector</hi> of them all, when he thought fit, and in its due time and place.</p>
               <p>His Humility (joined with so much Grace and Wisdom) caused, that he was of <note place="margin">Very peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, although men did differ from him in Opinion.</note> a very <hi>peaceable Spirit,</hi> and had a <hi>large Charity</hi> for good men, of all <hi>perswasions.</hi> His own understanding being great, made his <hi>Love and Charity</hi> also very large. He discerned, how that <hi>honest men</hi> do often mean the same thing, when they are apt to quarrel about their <hi>expressions</hi> of it; and therefore in <hi>dividing</hi> times, he was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62667:128"/> always of an uniting Spirit. Whilst others sought to <hi>wound</hi> the Reputation of men who differed from them, he did what he could to <hi>heal</hi> and <hi>compose</hi> all animosities which might arise upon such accounts. He was <hi>abundantly sensible</hi> of that <hi>bitterness</hi> which some men were ready to <hi>treat</hi> each others with, upon <hi>small differences of Opinion,</hi> and what mischiefs did <hi>follow thereupon;</hi> the <hi>life</hi> of Religion, and the <hi>power</hi> of Godliness, being almost <hi>extinguished</hi> thereby; and while some men pressed <hi>Ʋniformity</hi> in little matters; <hi>Conformity</hi> to the weighty Precepts of Christ Jesus (such as those of Love, and Charity, and forbearance to each other) were neglected.</p>
               <p>He did much wonder, that since the very Canons which were made in 1640. <note place="margin">Dissenters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated by the Canons of 40. but not by the Act in 62.</note> allowed men liberty to dissent, and to differ in practice, as to the point of bowing towards the Altar, and at the name of Jesus, how it should come to pass, that the Sign of the Cross should be so strictly required in the Act of Uniformity in 1662. But he did rarely <hi>publickly express this</hi> his admiration; for he would say frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that as breaking of <hi>Bones</hi> is extreamly <hi>painful</hi> to all the members, except dead ones, so are Church-divisions <hi>grievous</hi> to every one that is a true Christian: and as all <hi>motion</hi> is <hi>stopt,</hi> or render'd uneasie, by the <hi>dislocation</hi> of a Joint in a <hi>Leg</hi> or a <hi>Foot,</hi> so all <hi>progress</hi> in Religion, is hindered by the <hi>quarrels</hi> and <hi>fallings</hi> out of Brethren by the way. He studied <hi>always the things that made for peace,</hi> and sought to allay and quench those heats, which others (by their <hi>breath</hi> and <hi>bellows)</hi> endeavoured more and more to <hi>inflame.</hi> He was an hearty <hi>lover</hi> of, and had a great <hi>kindness for,</hi> every man, in whom he saw any thing of Gods Spirit appearing; and he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued men <hi>more or less,</hi> only as he saw <hi>more or less</hi> of the Divine Image stamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. He intreated all that he conversed with, that the <hi>truth of Grace</hi> in others, might be the most <hi>powerful Load-stone</hi> to draw out their hearts towards them. He would often say, that for one man to love another, only <hi>because he was of his own Opinion and Party,</hi> and to neglect another, who might be acted in greater things by the Divine Spirit, because he differ'd in smaller trifles; such a temper as this, did manifest, that such an one had little or nothing of the true love of God in him; <hi>for while that such a man did pretend to love his Brother, he did do herein, no other thing than hug himself, and embrace his own shadow, which he saw falling upon anothers breast.</hi>

               <p>Abundantly <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>charitable, meek</hi> and <hi>moderate,</hi> was this person at all <note place="margin">Yet he always was zealous in a good matter.</note> times; and yet notwithstanding, it must here be declared, That this <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi> and <hi>peaceableness</hi> of his Spirit, was such, as that it did not <hi>hinder,</hi> but did fully <hi>consist with,</hi> a mighty <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>activity</hi> for God, in all <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>important</hi> matters. He wanted not Zeal, when the <hi>main Articles</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> the <hi>Articuli stantis &amp; cadentis Ecclesiae,</hi> did call for, and <hi>require</hi> it. At the same time when he commended <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, for his reproving the <hi>hot</hi> contest of the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> about <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> he also honoured that <hi>Emperour</hi> for his warmth, in opposing the <hi>Arian heresie,</hi> as <hi>Sigonius</hi> relates, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Imp.

               </p>
               <p>Indeed, this Learned Divine was (as to his Zeal) a most excellent <hi>pattern,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all <hi>imitation.</hi> He was in this Grace (as well as in other things) a <hi>burning</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeal guided with Light.</note> and a <hi>shining</hi> light both. <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> were never divided in him. His <hi>fire</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times burned very hot, but yet always very clear, and without any manner of <hi>smoak.</hi> In his love to the salvation of Souls, he burned like a <hi>Lamp,</hi> consuming himself, his Body and Estate, (even all the Oyl that he possessed) and therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced, if hereby he might guide men to Heaven, and might <hi>shew</hi> any one the way to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> And hence it was, that a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> Man (that often heard him) said, That no man was more <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi> in the Doctrinal part of his Sermons, and none could be more <hi>affectionate</hi> and <hi>zealous</hi> (than he was) in the <hi>Application of his Doctrine.</hi> Indeed, it is a rarity to find a man of great <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and deep <hi>judgment,</hi> to be endowed with much <hi>Zeal,</hi> or with strong affections; but this mans <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were all kindled with a Fire which came immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Heaven;</hi> which did at once both enlighten his <hi>Head,</hi> and inflame his <hi>Heart</hi> also.</p>
               <p>He was a man of great <hi>prudence,</hi> as well as <hi>zeal.</hi> His <hi>Sails</hi> and <hi>Ballast</hi> were <note place="margin">His great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> exactly <hi>proportionate</hi> each to other. He could not be <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>sluggish</hi> in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of so <hi>good</hi> a <hi>Master</hi> as God is; but he did never <hi>run before he was sent.</hi> He would always <hi>stand still</hi> to hear his <hi>full Errand,</hi> and would stay to understand <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>plainly</hi> all his <hi>Masters will;</hi> which being so made known to him,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62667:129"/> he then was most <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>couragious</hi> in delivering of his <hi>Message,</hi>

               <p>His great prudence would not permit him to be <hi>rash,</hi> and his great zeal would not suffer him to be <hi>slow, negligent,</hi> or <hi>partial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had always a great love for God, and no man could be more concerned, either <note place="margin">A man of a very publick spirit.</note> for <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> than he was. He had continually such a <hi>publick Spirit,</hi> as that he <hi>scorned</hi> (at any time) to prefer any of his own <hi>private</hi> concerns, before the least <hi>publick</hi> good; yea, he constantly valued and rated all persons and things, according as any man, or any thing, had either a <hi>greater, or a lesser</hi> influence upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Those that observed him, might easily discern, that the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>welfare of his Church,</hi> were as the great <hi>Wheels,</hi> that did <hi>set on work</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> all his actions. He was a man most ready to deny himself at any time, if that in any thing <hi>thereby,</hi> he might promote and advance the Interest of <hi>another man;</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that <hi>other person</hi> did move in an higher, and <hi>more publick</hi> place than himself. That saying ought never to be forgot, which he once used Preaching to a great <hi>Auditory,</hi> and then declaring to them, That he could never expect to see, or <hi>find Peace on earth amongst men,</hi> until the Spirits of men were so acted by the Spirit of God, as the <hi>Spheres</hi> are said (in the old Philosophy) to be acted above by <hi>Angels,</hi> where all the <hi>little smaller Epicicles and Circles</hi> of every particular Orb, do all <hi>give up</hi> themselves wholly to the <hi>conduct</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>larger and greater Spheres;</hi> and truly (said he) it is <hi>this,</hi> which (according to that <hi>Hypothesis)</hi> doth make the <hi>sweetest Musick in Heaven;</hi> and were the same thing <hi>found</hi> and <hi>practised</hi> amongst men, it would make the most <hi>pleasant,</hi> and perpetual <hi>harmony on Earth.</hi> But there are <hi>few men</hi> who are <hi>blessed</hi> with such <hi>large</hi> Souls, and such <hi>generous minds</hi> as his was; who did bear the <hi>interest</hi> of the publick, and <hi>welfare</hi> of the <hi>universal Church,</hi> so deeply <hi>engraven</hi> upon his heart. St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> formerly was of this temper; who lived little to <hi>himself,</hi> and was all for others; whose <hi>Motto</hi> it was, <hi>Partior mihi totus foris;</hi> and our Saint might have used the same words, for he had wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated and devoted himself to the Service of the <hi>publick;</hi> and so long as he had <hi>any strength left,</hi> he did most chearfully improve every <hi>Talent</hi> which God had lent him, to the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>him</hi> who had <hi>intrusted</hi> him <hi>therewith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at last, when (by reason of his <hi>extreme</hi> age) he could not <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>publickly</hi>

               <p>His Age was good also, because it was an <hi>haile</hi> and <hi>healthy</hi> old Age (saving those <note place="margin">He had an healthful Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per all his days.</note> times wherein he was <hi>dis-spirited,</hi> and troubled with a <hi>swimming</hi> in his Head, by reason of <hi>over much</hi> Study; which lasted not above <hi>two months</hi> the first time, and <hi>three months</hi> the last time) it might be said of him, that <hi>he never had one sick day for above Threescore years together,</hi> (the starting of his <hi>Navel</hi> was no <hi>sickness</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crasie,</hi> although a great inconvenience in hindering from <hi>Riding;</hi> but it did never hinder him above <hi>ten days,</hi> either from his <hi>Study</hi> or <hi>Labours)</hi> so that almost all his days were <hi>Halcyon-days.</hi> His old Age was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> in old Age, is reckoned as a double mercy, both by <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 34. 7. and also by <hi>Caleb,</hi> Josh. 14. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>There were many things found in him which (under God) did very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <note place="margin">Many things found in him conducing to Health.</note> to his <hi>health,</hi> and subserved to <hi>lengthen</hi> out his days. As first, That he made great <hi>Conscience</hi> of taking care to preserve his health. He knew that (without <hi>health)</hi> very little of his <hi>Pastoral work</hi> could be discharged. He made Conscience therefore of keeping that <hi>instrument clean,</hi> which God had <hi>honoured,</hi> (and he hoped would <hi>more honour)</hi> by using of it. He valued health, not so much upon <hi>his own account,</hi> as upon Gods. His body being the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> he did what he <hi>could</hi> to keep it in <hi>good repair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, he was a person that was very <hi>temperate,</hi> and did always use a very spare <note place="margin">He was always very tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in all things.</note> Diet. He did not <hi>dig</hi> his Grave with his <hi>Teeth,</hi> as <hi>Gluttons</hi> do, or <hi>drown</hi> himself in <hi>strong</hi> Liquors, as too many others do. It is a true, and a witty saying of a <hi>late ingenious</hi> person, (well <hi>skill'd</hi> in Physick, but no Practicer) that when mens bodies are <hi>over-charged</hi> with Meats and Drinks, they <hi>recoil</hi> upon their owners, and instead of <hi>discharging</hi> their proper Offices, they burst out into Surfeits and Diseases.</p>
               <p>Again, he was a man of no <hi>violent</hi> passions, the <hi>over-agitation</hi> of which (saith the last mentioned Author) doth cause a <hi>too great</hi> fermentation of Heat, and often produceth <hi>Feavers;</hi> but <hi>calmness</hi> and <hi>sedateness</hi> of temper, keeps the blood <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>sweet.</hi> It is usually said, that <hi>mores sequuntur humores,</hi> that mens <hi>manners</hi> do answer the <hi>temper</hi> of their bodies; and it is as true, that <hi>humores sequuntur mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> mens <hi>health depends</hi> much upon mens <hi>manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But again, (he thought so himself at least, that) he was much the <hi>more health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> because he avoided all <hi>unnecessary</hi> tampering with <hi>Physick.</hi> He counted <hi>Physick</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A governour of his passions</note> an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, and he much <hi>honoured</hi> those that were <hi>able</hi> in that <hi>Profession;</hi> but he made as <hi>little</hi> use of any of them, as he <hi>could possibly</hi> do. He loved <hi>Kitchen Physick,</hi> but cared for <hi>none else.</hi> He would allow of <hi>Catharticks</hi> in some cases, but would always say, that <hi>the oftner the Kettle is scowred,</hi> the more clean it may look, but the thinner it grows. He did use <hi>Phlebotomy once</hi> or <hi>twice</hi> in his whole life, and not oftner; for he compared <hi>Blood-letting</hi> to the <hi>Snuffing of a Candle,</hi> which for a time, makes it burn a little brighter, but withal, causes it to wast much the faster.</p>
               <p>From the healthfulness of his <hi>natural constitution,</hi> it came to pass, that it might be truly said of him, <hi>That he died of no Disease but that of old Age.</hi> There was no <note place="margin">Careful about taking Physick</note> Thief in his Candle to hasten its Consumption, nor any <hi>acute distemper</hi> to be as an extinguisher to it; but his Lamp burned clear, so long as there was left one drop of natural Oil to feed it with. Some Weeks before his death, an accident had caused a <hi>little sore</hi> upon one of his Legs, which dried up of its self a very few days before his departure. The stopping of this Sore (the <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi> said) was a certain <hi>Prognostick</hi> (but no cause) of his death, although it be often so in younger persons.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:62667:130"/>
               <p> He kept his Bed but one whole day before his departure, a departure which he <note place="margin">He much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be dissolved.</note> had <hi>long longed</hi> and <hi>waited</hi> for; and the very day before his <hi>last day on Earth,</hi> some company being with him, he expressed how much comfort he did then take, to consider how that his Saviour had <hi>tasted death for him;</hi> and that Christ (by his Resurrection) had given him an assurance, that he was the <hi>first-fruits of those that sleep in him;</hi> telling some that stood by him, that it was very much the Duty of Believers to rejoice, that death had lost its <hi>Sting,</hi> and was now <hi>disarmed;</hi> and that the power of the Grave was quite <hi>vanquished</hi> and <hi>overcome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A while after, he broke out into the Apostolical <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>breadth, and depth of the unsearchable Riches of the Grace of God in Christ Jesus!</hi> Oh the height of that love, whereby God hath declared pardon to poor Penitents! Oh the freeness of his Grace, who doth offer Christ to all that will receive him <hi>humbly</hi> and <hi>believingly!</hi> that is, who will take him with an empty hand, joining nothing of their own works with the Merits of Christ in point of Justification: Some while after, some persons coming to see him, he told them, that he knew not how to requite them (for that love which they had shewn unto him) better, than by exhorting them to <hi>redeem the time,</hi> especially the time of youth and of health; for except there be <hi>first (in health,)</hi> an inward principle of Grace wrought in the heart, the time of sickness and old age would be very unfit for so great a work, as that of <hi>gaining evidences for Heaven:</hi> for, said he, times of sickness and old age, are times of considering, not of gaining such evidences. He advised them therefore (now in time) to prepare for Eternity; and told them, that that work was only to be done, by <hi>entring into Covenant with God,</hi> and making their Peace <hi>through Christ;</hi> which being once sincerely done, then neither a sick-bed, nor a death-bed, could do any of them the least hurt.</p>
               <p>The night after, he grew very weak, and his vital Spirits <hi>decayed more and more,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His last Breath.</note> till the Morning of the next day, <hi>viz. December</hi> the <hi>14th,</hi> 1677. when he expired his last breath, and immediately <hi>entred into that Everlasting Rest,</hi> which he had so often <hi>prayed,</hi> and so much <hi>prepared</hi> for. St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, that he dare say, <hi>That no man can die ill that hath lived well, De Dis. cap.</hi> 6. If this be so, then no wonder that such persons as have lived well, <hi>to desire to be dissolved,</hi> as this man had ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly done, but yet always with submission: for although he had <hi>mortein in desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deriis,</hi> although <hi>he desired to die,</hi> yet he had <hi>vitam in patientia, he was not impatient to go hence.</hi> His desire was with an intire and absolute resignation to Divine pleasure.</p>
               <p>Neither indeed, had he any cause to be weary of the world, upon any other <note place="margin">A great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of Heaven.</note> reason save this, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>fully rid of the body of death;</hi> for upon all other accounts, he had <hi>lead as happy a life</hi> as most men <hi>ever did</hi> on Earth.

               <p>He was blessed with pious, prudent and affectionate Relations, both Wives and Children.

It is true, that he then being ignorant of the <hi>full History of his Life,</hi> and not having seen his <hi>Diary,</hi> his expressions could be only more <hi>general,</hi> of those things which are here declared more <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>particularly.</hi> And let the Reader yet farther know, that it being desired by the Publisher, that <hi>another Reverend, Renowned, and very Learned Conformist,</hi> (an acquaintance of the deceased) would also <hi>testifie</hi> and <hi>make known</hi> those things which he had <hi>observed</hi> in him <hi>worthy of remark and imitation,</hi> he was pleased to send the Publisher the <hi>following Letter</hi> in answer to his request.</p>

Crit. sacr.</hi> He flourished first in those times, when publick, practical, and edifying Preaching was but too scarce, (for reasons commonly divulged, and not fit for me to take notice of.) But by his prudent conduct of himself and of his Ministry, he obtained the favour, and the happiness of continuing in his publick Labours, and weekly Lectures: by reason whereof, as I have been often credibly informed, his Church was so thronged, that (though, for a Village, very large and capacious, yet) there was no getting in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by some hours attending before his Exercise began; and then the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Walls were generally lined with Sholes and Multitudes of People, which came (many) from far, (some above twenty Miles) so that you should see the Church yard (which was likewise very spacious) Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoed with Horses, tyed to the outward Rayles, while their Owners were greedily waiting to hear the word of Life from his mouth. And as that famous Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham</hi> was the <hi>Fairclough</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> so he
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62667:131"/> was the <hi>Rogers</hi> of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> I sometimes attended upon his publick Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and heard him with trembling and admiration; for he was a Boanerges in the Pulpit, not only in respect of the strength of his Voice, and terribleness of his expression, when he thundered against prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and enforced to Repentance; but in regard of the solidness of his matter; free from all light, rash, uncouth expressions; nauseating Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies, indigested, crude and affected phrases (which have been noted, and justly censured in some others, although applauded and magnified by the injudicious and moveable Multitude) but closely compacted, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously framed, and excellently methodiz'd though in a Stile and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner peculiar to himself, (for I confess, I have seldom or never heard the like, with respect to all those admirable ingredients) and managed with such cogency of Reason, and strength of Argument, that he at once both drew, and conquered and compelled his Auditors. And I doubt not but he was a most happy and blessed Instrument (in the hand of the great God) to turn many to Righteousness. All this time I only knew him by report, and sight in publick, having for ten years and upwards (though then of the Vicinity) no private Acquaintance at all with him. And indeed, he had such a Majestick presence, and such a severe and reserved Gravity in his Countenance, that it (together with the Authority of his Ministry) had gained upon me, and did strike a kind of awful fear into me, which made me look upon it as an high degree of presumption, for a person so young as then I was, and sufficiently conscious of my own unworthiness, once to attempt the favour of so great a man, and so renowned and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in his Generation. But I was quickly undeceived, and soon after, easily apprehended my great errour and mistake which I had so long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under. For about that time, being drawn by some others (in a matter of great concern) to wait upon him, I had such a friendly and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Reception, and found him so meek, so affable, so humble and familiar in his deportment and behaviour; and I was so surprised and captivated with the sweetness of his disposition, that I came away chiding my self for my former timidity, and conceiving a kind of indignation in my bosom, that I had deprived my self (for so many years) of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable benefit, which I might have gained by a Converse so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to me, both as to this, and the other world. Yet I soon happily experienced an abundant compensation; for the truth is, from that time he cast an especial eye, and set a signal mark of peculiar favour and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship upon me; and soon took me for his most intimate acquaintance: and he was quickly the first occasion of that Preferment, the great God by his means hath graciously advanced me to. And now I frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted to him; and they were the pleasantest, and most delightful Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys I ever made in all my life: for what he said of his Friend, <hi>Semper a te doctior redeo,</hi> I could truly, and with a more happy addition say of him, <hi>Semper ab illo doctior &amp; melior redii.</hi> His speech was gracious, and seasoned with Salt: His arguments nervous and cogent: His discourse sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious: His sayings Apothegms, and all tending to promote true Piety, and the power of Godliness. His Conversation such as becometh the Gospel of Christ Jesus; and I may justly pronounce of him that high and lofty, yet ingenious commendation <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> pronounced on the great St. <hi>Basil, That he thundered in his Doctrine, and lightened in his Conversation. Orat. funebr. in laudem Basil.

                        <hi>God?</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. I have been often at his Table, and in Family-Duty with him, where his heart would be exceedingly enlarged; and his design was to engage all to love and fear the Lord. He comfortably experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the benefit and the blessing of it: Living to see all his Children grown up to great maturity in spiritual Wisdom and Understanding, and walking in the fear of the Lord; some of them especially, with whom I have had a more intimate converse, are true Inheritors of their Fathers eminent Virtues and admired Ornaments. In a word, I may truly say of him, he was as <hi>Apollos,</hi> mighty in the Scriptures, Fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord night and day with incessant Prayer, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Supplications; and as <hi>Barnabas</hi> a good man, not gilded but Gold; having, as <hi>Demetrius,</hi> a good report of all men, and of the Truth it self; shining as a great Light in his Generation, and transmitting and sending forth eminent Rayes and Beams to enlighten others. I never observed any thing in him that a very Momus might, without abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wresting, carp at. From this time I attended more frequently upon his Lectures, which I more and more admired, both for the excellency of the matter, his rare and choice notions, grave and ponderous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, soundness of Doctrine, solid Learning, and in a more sublimated and advanced Style, or as <hi>Lypsius</hi> phrases it, <hi>Stylo imperatorio,</hi> than what (I thought) I had before observed; and, as I apprehended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the capacity of most of his Hearers: They were indeed elegant and rare Discourses, suited <hi>ad Clerum</hi> (many of which usually attended) rather than <hi>ad Populum;</hi> which, as I remember, I sometimes insinuated to him: But I found, he was now habituated and grown up to such a noble, generous and masculine way of expression; and it was become so familiar to him, that it was hardly in his power to take off himself from that Grandeur in his publick Discourses. And this I the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, because even in Prayer, not only in publick, but in his Family (which sometimes, as I said, I had the blessed advantage of.) His way of expression was proportionable. And the truth is, he had a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent freedom in that Divine Exercise, beyond any I have known; neither making too bold with the great God, nor guilty of any indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; which was then too common a fault and indignity, offered to the God of the whole world: but addressing himself with that Reverence and Humility to the supream and sacred Majesty of Heaven and Earth, with that abasedness of Spirit in enlarged Confession (which some had then almost quite forgotten) and with that ardour and earnestness of zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous affection, that the Kingdom of Heaven seemed to suffer Violence, and he to be one of the violent that took it by force. He was a person of a most exact and solid judgment, and happy was he that could obtain and follow his Counsel; which I confess, I think some choice Friends only were enriched with; for (living in Critical times) he was very much (I am sure I thought too much) reserved: I my self yet found such success in following those advices which I gained from him, that I resorted to him as to an Oracle; and could I have obtained it, I should have been unwilling to have transacted any matter of moment, but by the Law of his mouth; which I always found guided within the bounds of pure Religion and undefiled, and by the exactest rules of profound prudence; and withal, he seemed to have more than ordinary foresight of Contingencies. He was an excellent Peace-maker, and very happy in his Decisions and Conclusions, which many have found much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty

Once there fell out a difference between my self and a Neighbour Minister, we both centred in him to judge the Cause, and decide the Controversie: which he did, with so much gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, piety, meekness, moderation and strength of Reasoning (after he had summed up the whole matter, and shewn the inconveniencies on either side) without any the least partiality, that though neither of us both had our wills, yet both came away fully contented, and were loving Friends ever after. He was adorned and enriched with sound and sober Principles, very moderate in his Judgment, as to our late (and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued) unhappy Controversies. I knew a Friend that went to him for advice upon the point of Conformity, and I had it from himself, that he received this Answer from him, You shall excuse me as to any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Resolution, this only I say to you: though I cannot for divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (not so fit to be communicated) yield to all that is enjoyned; yet this I assure you, I judge what is injoined to be such, That if a man lives holily, and walks humbly with God, I shall ever love him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Conformity; and if he be proud, contentious and prophane, I will never think well of him for his Non-conformity. And he was so affected and afflicted with our Dissensions about lesser things, that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some others and my self, debating some of those disputable things, He passionately brake off our Discourse with that <hi>Suspirium Bucholce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianum; Quis ne liberabit ab hac rixosa Theologia.</hi> He ever detested and abhorred that Regicide committed upon our late dread Soveraign; and was so affected with it, upon the first infaustous <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> that he had liberty to Preach, he chose his Text out of <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. 4. And was so exceedingly transported at that amazing and most blessed Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the miraculous and happy return of our dread Soveraign (whom God in mercy to this poor Nation, and his Church therein, long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve) that upon the first occasion, as I have been credibly informed, he vented his Joy in his publick Exercise to the People, from those words of Loyal <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> who had been falsly and basely accused, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 30. <hi>Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my Lord the King is come again in Peace unto his own House.</hi> I much bewailed his exauthorising himself and his publick Ministry; and have often thought, that if there had been a Temper found, whereby such useful and sober spirited men (as I always observed him to be) might have been continued in their publick Function, under the shelter and protection of a legal Sanction, it had been a mighty strengthning to the Protestant Interest, and much better with the Church of <hi>England</hi> than now it is. Though far be it from me to censure or call in question the Actions and Decrees of our Superiours, to whom I have long since learned, in all things, not contrary to the Revelation of the Divine Will in the Sacred Cannons, to subject my self, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake, whatever has been pretended or objected to the contrary. He lived many years after this, to the 83. or 84. year of his Age, and might have done much Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Church of God in his publick Ministry, by his eminent worth and exemplary Conversation, made more manifest to the world: But his Spirit was then much broken with that dismal and abortive suddain change which he sadly experienced in that place, (wherein formerly his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry had been so fruitful, powerful and successful) and he several times complained of it to me with great lamentation; and I doubt not but
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62667:133"/> this made his Remove the more easie to him. Though I must perswade my self (if other considerations, which he reserved to himself, had not preponderated) he would not have deserted his Charge, meerly upon that sole account; for his bowels did exceedingly yearn towards that People. Once I remember going to his Lecture, it happened to prove a Funeral Sermon for a poor Woman, that in her sickness never sent to him, nor gave him the least intimation of her desire to speak with him; and so far as I can recollect, he told me, that he knew nothing of it, living at a considerable distance, till it was too late. The good old Gentleman (in the pangs and throws of his Spirit, fixes upon that Subject, <hi>James</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>Is any sick among you, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him—</hi>From whence, having most learnedly and judiciously asserted the Duty of the People, to send for their Minister at such a time; and shewn the great benefits might come to them thereby; he did so dolefully and passionately bewail his own unhappiness, that any (under his inspection and charge) should go to Eternity (he not having exercised his Pastoral Office towards them) that I believe it greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected all that were present; and sent away many with weeping Eyes, and akeing Hearts, for what they had heard that day; so highly valued, and so dearly beloved, were the Souls of the meanest of his People to him. After his withdrawing from <hi>Ketton,</hi> I commonly once or twice in a year, (till he removed into high <hi>Suffolk)</hi> waited upon him, to tender my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects and duty to him; and always found him chearful, full of sweet content; never complaining, but of the prophaneness and iniquity of the times, and Divisions of the Church of God, replenished with holy and heavenly motions, spiritual breathings, and blessed hopes of entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods eternal rest; and still maintaining his ancient freedom and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with me, and that esteem he had (altogether undeservedly) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of me. And I experienced him so true a Friend (though I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther justly honoured him as a Father) that neither difference of Opinion, nor distance of place, nor seldomness of Converse, nor any worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, did cause the least ab-alienation of his spirit from a person so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth: which most of all appeared, in the last visit I gave him at <hi>Stow-market;</hi> when quite spent and worn out with Age, he delivered himself to this purpose; I am now going out of the world, of which I have had my full, and must leave you, and all my Friends; But I have charged my Sons when I am gone that you may have no cause to complain for want of me; but that they maintain and keep up, the same degree of respect and friendship to you, that I have done. So firm was his Love, and so stedfast and immoveable his transcendent Kindness, that he would have it out-live Death it self: In this degenerous and declining Age, such a faithful Friend who can find? With what Circumstances his Sickness and Death was attended, I know not, nor ever had any account of; being at that time hindered from paying my dutiful Respects to him, by the heavy afflicting hand of the just and holy God long upon me. But I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self, the frame and actings of his Soul at his Dissolution, were proportionable and suitable to the eminent Holiness of his Life; and he whose Conversation was in Heaven, while detained here on Earth, could not but have much of Heaven in his heart, in his nearest approaches thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. These are but some of those many Excellencies (which on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and in a great hurry of business) I could hastily gather up, as Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rather than Memoirs, to be remarked in this Worthy and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62667:134"/> Person. Which if you (Reverend Sir) and his other worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, vouchsafe to take in good part, it will abundantly add to that satisfaction I have in my own Spirit, in delineating, and copying them out of my own breast to you. Though I doubt not, but many of his cordial Friends, Reverend Fellow-Brethren and dear Neighbours, that knew him longer, lived nearer to him, and were more frequently parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his indefatigable Labours, and more happy in a continued Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with him, can help you with whole Sheaves of his worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and of the various passages of his most strict and holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; of which these are but some Gleanings only.</p>

Upon his Fathers admonition, and his own confession of his childish folly (as St. <hi>Austin</hi> did his) it was often afterwards a great trouble to his Conseience, and kept him humble and watchful.

               <p>On a <hi>Lords Day,</hi> going into the Work-House in his Fathers Yard, and loitering there a while, he heedlesly clapt his hand on a Tenter-Hook, and tore it very much; whereupon he resolved no more to mispend his time on the <hi>Lords-Day;</hi> but wholly to apply himself to the Religious observation of it; which resolution he ever after adhered to, and observed, whether at home or abroad.</p>
               <p>Being now in the university, he made a good proficiency in the Learning which might make him most Instrumental for the winning of Souls to <hi>Christ,</hi> that being his cheifest Design in the Service of his Generation; in order whereunto, we find him associating himself with an honest <hi>Club</hi> of Schollers, of his own, and other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, who were not onely daily conversant in <hi>Philosophical</hi> Exercises, but did frequently meet to promote the great business of real Godliness, and growth in Grace, and to make experiments on their own hearts of that Religion when they should be called to impart to others.</p>
               <p>And it seems he began betimes to communicate what he had received of the Grace of God; for not long after his being of that Colledge, he observed a young Scholler of very good Parts, and of a good Humour, but having nothing of real Godliness, whom he would seek, and single out and talk with, to draw him off from vanity, and to engage him to mind the concerns of his precious and immortal Soul. And it pleased God that in a short time, that same Scholler fell sick unto Death, and upon his Death-bed sent for our Mr. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> to whom he declared how much he was affected with what he had formerly said unto him in his Health, thanking him for the love and care he had shewed for the good of his Soul; he also

Here, when he had performed the last Offices to his Dying, and Dead Father, and was comforting his sorrowful Mother, and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Family; he was importuned by some godly Christians of his acquaintance, to exercise, and imploy his Talents in Preaching the Gospel as occasion should be offered.</p>
               <p>And this motion upon their Invitation he readily Embraced; and by his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gave such evident Proofs of his Experimental Knowledge, Utterance, and his Zeal for God and his Glory, that upon the Death of Mr. <hi>Morton</hi> (a very Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Worthy Minister) the Parishioners of <hi>St. Mary Newington-Buts,</hi> having heard him Preach, and being satisfied of his Learning, Piety, and Ministerial Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Petitioned for him to those who were then in Authority, and <hi>Feb.</hi> 16. 1652. he was ordered to the <hi>Rectory,</hi> as a <hi>Godly and Orthodox Divine.</hi> And this was very Remarkable in his Election; yet, though the Parishioners were divided into two several Parties, and both went with their Petitions unto <hi>Westminster</hi> to have a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister setled among them, neither Party knowing the others mind, yet, they both pitched upon him, for whom the unanimous Parishioners did easily obtain a Grant.</p>
               <p>Probably, much about this time, he was chosen a Fellow of <hi>Christs Colledg,</hi> whereof he was a Member before; yet, by the advice of Dr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, who was the Head of the House, and his special Friend, he resolved to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the charge at <hi>Newington,</hi> where he was so unanimously desired, and where he might (as he thought) have a better opportunity of doing good to Souls, which thing was most upon his heart.</p>
               <p>Having now a Pastoral charge, his next business and care was to proceed to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and having after a strict Examination, and Profession of his Faith, been solemnly set apart to the Ministerial Office by Fasting and Prayer, and the laying on of the Presbitery's Hands in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> great Congregation, in the Church of St. <hi>Mary-Ax, London:</hi> He, like a good Husband-man, considering what course to take for the best advantage of the People, now committed by God to his charge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to <hi>Catechize</hi> them, which he was very zealous to do, which also he did with very great and good success.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Lords days</hi> in his own Family, when his great work was over in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregation, he had his Sermons repeated, and himself Prayed, and sung <hi>Psalms</hi> with them: And being well instructed of his Lord and Master, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Apostles charge. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Preach the Word: be instant, in season, out of season,</hi> &amp;c. About this time, there being a great and long Frost, when poor Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen were hard put to it for a Subsistance, he set up an expository Lecture, for four or five mornings in a week, which he continued at least two months together, and his Labours were attended with God's special Blessings: for it proved a means of turning several Persons from the evil of their ways to God, and some that had lived loosly, could, with humility and thankfulness acknowledge, that a work of Grace was then wrought upon them, so that there were the Seals of his Ministry, and of that Truth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 11. <hi>A word spoken in season,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus this painful Servant of God continued in the work of his Ministry, till he was forced to resign that Benefice to one Mr. <hi>James Meggs,</hi> in the twelfth of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. and in the month of <hi>August,</hi> he pretending a legal title to the place.</p>
               <p>Yet the great God, who had made much use of this choise Instrument in his work, would not as yet let him lye by useless. For besides his Lecture on <hi>Saturday</hi> morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62667:135"/> at St. <hi>Antholines,</hi> and sometimes also there at five a Clock in the evenings on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and for some time on <hi>Munday-</hi>Nights at <hi>Margaret Fishstreet-Hill, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> where, by the concourse of Auditors, it was evident that his Labours were much valued; he was, by the Parishioners of <hi>Lawrence-Poultney</hi> (in whose Hand the Presentation to the Place then was) chosen to be their Minister, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued (being then a Widdower) in the House of his worthy Friend, <hi>Mr. Robert de Luna,</hi> Merchant, till that Black <hi>Bartholomew Anno Christi</hi> 1662. at which time, he, with many Hundreds more of his Brethren, were cast out of their Places, and Imployments.</p>
               <p>At the request of his Friends, he Preached a Farewel Sermon to them on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-</hi>night before that dismal day, though they spake not to him till that very day at Dinner, and requested him to Preach upon that Text, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened, and heard, and a Book of Remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought on his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having Dined, he went aside to his Meditations. He would often say; Blessed be God, if I have but a little time to premeditate and digest my matter, I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at a loss for words on my Masters Ambassy. 'Twas observed by his Friends, who most conversed with him, and in whose House he sojourned for some time, that he was a Praise-worthy man in all his Deportment, of singuler Piety, and a constant promoter of Holiness in the Families wherein he resided. He used to be much raised in his Spirit when he came from Preaching, especially from the <hi>Table of the Lord,</hi> being then as in an Heaven upon Earth.</p>
               <p>He would with much Prudence reprove sin in any Person, of what Quality or Rank soever. That might rightly be said of him, which is Recorded of Mr. <hi>H. Latimer,</hi> Martyr. He did behave himself as a faithful Messenger of God, being afraid of no man: Telling all Degrees their Duties faithfully and truly, without respect of Persons, or any kind of flattery.</p>
               <p>He cared not much to converse with the Rich, except it were to bring them off to works of Charity. When, in the things of this World he met with Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he used to pass them over as not much concerned. In Discourse he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mild, and would suffer others to speak, and having heard them, he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Passion, and with Judgment and clearness return an answer to them.</p>
               <p>If he heard one Christian speak bitterly against another, he would say, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably he meant better than he expressed himself: and if what he said could be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in two Senses, it ought to be Interpreted in the best. Those who were best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, observed that he was a Prudent Man, very serious, and usually very chearful. Going in Frost and Snow to Preach, a Friend meeting him, said, that he pittied him in regard of his bad Journy; to whom he charfully answered, that it was to do his Masters Work; and going, it was no Burden to him to serve so good a Master, though he passed through many Difficulties.</p>
               <p>He had early Impressions upon his Heart (as we heard before) for the strict Sanctification of the <hi>Lords Days,</hi> which continued with him so long as he lived. For several years it was his usual Practice, when he rose out of his Bed on those Days, with a chearful Heart and Voice, to sing a <hi>Psalm,</hi> or part of it; for the putting of his Heart into a spiritual frame for the Work of the Day; or to repeat that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation of the Heavenly Host, Recorded, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth Peace, Goodwill towards Men.</hi> And by such means his Spirit was much raised, zealously to perform the Lord's Work. He was for the due Sanctification of the whole Day, not only in the publick Congregation, but in his Family, and amongst his Friends: And if he heard any of them talk about Worldly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, he would with Candour rebuke them, saying, St. <hi>John</hi> when he was in <hi>Dalmos,</hi> was in <hi>the Spirit on the Lords Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Humility was such, that speaking to one of his near Relations; he said, if it were possible that I could do so much Work for God as any man upon Earth doth; I would not care whether it were known that there was such a Man as I in the World or no. So little did he regard the applause of men in what he did; and truly neither did he regard the reward of men: For when he was told of some Presents; which, by some of his Neighbours were sent to some of his Brethren in the Ministry, and being demanded whether they had been with him; he answered

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:62667:137"/> no: Saying, that he was not sorry that he was passed by in that way. Yea, (said he) I am heartily glad that I had none of their Presents, that so I may receive my Reward from my Master; for I am never better pleased then to think that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have done his Work, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath all my Reward in Reversion for me.</p>
               <p>Yea, he used to express some trouble when any of the meaner People brought him any small thing. For though he thankfully accepted of their kindness, yet he would signifie that he desired not to be burdensom to them. Yea, he used great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to accept of Favours though never so small. One bringing of him a little cordial Water, being ill after his Preaching, with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven, he said, <hi>what am I, or my Fathers House, that God is so mindful of me a poor Creature? Oh! Blessed be God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His impartiallity in judging of differences among his Friends and Acquaintance was remarkable. And he used to advise his Friends to watch for opportunites to seek God in private, wherein himself also was very frequent.</p>
               <p>When a Door was opened to him to Preach at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> though he met with many Difficulties, yet was he partly necessitated to abide there for the health of his Family, and God encouraged him by a great confluence of Hearers, to whom his Labours were very grateful.</p>
               <p>His Charity was manifested to his distressed Brethren, in making many Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections for them in the places where he Preached; and he had a singular faculty in disposing his Hearers to give liberally. Himself was not given to filthy lucre, nor of a covetous mind; he was charitable to the Poor, and affable in conversing with Christians of the meaner rank. He would often say, he rejoyced to send them away in a chearful frame, because they were Gods Creatures, and it was God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to make the hearts of the Poor merry: he would not have those of his Family too hard in buying things of poor People; saying, they would rejoyce if they had a good price for their Commodities which they carried about to sell.</p>
               <p>And farther to shew his freedom from Covetousness: when <hi>T. S.</hi> the Son of his second Wife, by a former Husband, was dangerously sick of the small Pox, and by his Death Mr. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> would have gotten six hundred pounds; yet he called his godly Friends together, and again, and again, sought the Lord for the recovery of him, and prevailed, and upon his restauration to Health, in the like solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner returned thanks unto God for the same.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was at <hi>Newington,</hi> many overtures and motions were made to him for the change of his Condition, but he hearkened to none of them; having before fixed his Eye upon one, unto whom, after mature deliberation, he made known his affections, and her Parents consented that she should match with him. She was a vertuous young Gentlewoman, of a good Family, being a younger Daughter of <hi>Henry Hasting,</hi> Esq; of the Parish of <hi>Newington-Buts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By her he had born to him, <hi>Octob.</hi> 3. 1661. a Son, named <hi>Henry Hastings:</hi> but the Pious Mother, lived not above ten days after his Birth; dying <hi>Octob.</hi> 13th. next following, and her Son soon followed his Mother, dying <hi>Novemb.</hi> 15. at Nurse. After which, he sojourned for a short time with his good Friend Mr. O. S. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with Mr. <hi>De Luna.</hi> And having continued a Widdower about two years, he was recommended to a virtuous Widdow Mrs. <hi>Margaret Sharp;</hi> Daughter to <hi>Henry Gibs</hi> of <hi>Bristol,</hi> Esq; and the Relict of Mr. <hi>Tho. Sharp,</hi> Merchant; about <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1663. to whom also he was conjoined in Marriage.</p>
               <p>She had a Son by her former Husband, who also left a Daughter <hi>(Lucy Sharp)</hi> whom he had by a former Wife: This Daughter being Consumptive, did not long survive the Marriage of her Mother in Law; but in her sickness did greatly bless God, for her being thereby Related to Mr. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> whose Instructions, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers she found to be succesful for the good of her immortal Soul.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> about this time, for his Health-sake, lived mostly at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> yet came to Preach to his Congregation in <hi>Southwark.</hi> By this Wife he had a Son born to him, <hi>Octo.</hi> 10. 1666. named <hi>Josiah;</hi> whose Mother became sickly, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Jan.</hi> 3. 1667. left her Husband a sorrowful Widdower again. This Son <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> lived about five years and an half, to the great comfort of his Father; but <hi>March</hi> 25. 1672. he followed his Mother, he was very dear to his Father, who was much affected with, and afflicted for his loss, yet set a fair Copy to others of much Christian Patience, and submission to the will of God.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:62667:137"/>
               <p> After this he continued a Widower about the space of Three Years, and then Married a Third Wife, <hi>Anno,</hi> the sole Daughter of Collonel <hi>Markham,</hi> of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Family, and a Gentleman of his Majesties Privy-Chamber; by whom he had first <hi>Anna,</hi> then <hi>Hester,</hi> after her <hi>Thomas,</hi> and lastly <hi>Nathanael.</hi> These Four he left alive when himself died; but his youngest Son, when he was about a Year and half old, departed this Life to rest with his Father, who died about a Twelvemonth before.</p>
               <p>In the time of perfect Health he was mindful of a Change, and used often to Pray, That God would prepare him and his for Sickness, Death, and parting. About half a Year before his last Sickness, being taken with an exceeding sharp Pain, when it was over, he said, That he would not have been without it, because of those Joys which he found accompanying of it. About this time he left his House in <hi>Theobalds,</hi> and came to one in <hi>Pickle-Herring;</hi> this was about Three Weeks, and odd Days before he Died.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Octob.</hi> 16. 1676. He was chearful in the Morning, but in the Afternoon his Pain came upon him; yet did he possess his Soul in more then ordinary Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor was willing to send for a Doctor till <hi>Octob.</hi> 24. after his having been in extream pain Night and Day for a Week together. Then by the great importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Friends, he was prevailed with, and sent for one who was in great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, both for Skill and Practice.</p>
               <p>The Doctor at his first Visit Judged it to be the Stone, not doubting but that he would do well notwithstanding. This was <hi>Octob.</hi> 24. the Night after he slept well, which he considering, said to some of his Friends, That he was like a Man that had gone over a Precipice, and looking back, trembled to see the Danger he had passed. For (said he) when I was in pain, God supported me; and now I stand amazed to consider how I got through. He would often say, when he saw others in great pain, That he was afraid of Dying, because of those Antecedent pains; but he was not afraid to be Dead, knowing that then he should for ever be with the Lord.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Wednesday</hi> the <hi>25th,</hi> he rose pretty chearful, and spent some time in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but after Dinner his pains returned again; and he began to complain of Sin, saying, <hi>Ah! vile Sinner! God is carrying me back again into the Wilderness to afflíct me,</hi> and withal he expressed some sorrow of Heart, but without the least Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering.</p>
               <p>There he bad his Wife to Read the <hi>88th Psalm;</hi> and by that time she had done, divers Friends came into Visit, and bemoan him; and about Seven a Clock at Night came in his Wives Brother, Mr. <hi>W. Gibs,</hi> and his Wife, who greatly respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and loved him dearly. They discoursed with him about taking an House near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>London</hi> then <hi>Theobalds:</hi> To whom he replied, with great calmness of Spirit; Yea, God will provide me a Country, <hi>viz.</hi> an Heavenly.</p>
               <p>Then his former Wives Son, <hi>[Tho. Sharp,]</hi> being to go to Sea, he said unto him thus, It is not likely that we Two shall meet again hear, and he (with Tears) gave him a most Pathetical Exhortation, to mind his Souls Spiritual and Eternal Welfare, to Serve God Holily, Righteously and Soberly, in this present World. The Night following his Pains returned with much acuteness.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Thursday</hi> Morning, the <hi>26th</hi> Day, he had again sharp pains; and in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon some Ministers, and Christian Friends met, earnestly to seek the Lord in his behalf. And his pain returning again, he said, He was in an Agony, but not in a Bloody one: And what are all my pains to those which Christ suffered for me. And his Friends Prayed earnestly, that God would give him Faith and Patience; he often said, <hi>Though thou killest me, yet will I trust in thee.</hi> And when they were importunate with God, that he would spare his Life, and restore him to Health, he said, Ah! poor useless, sinful, wretched Creature, that they should be so earnest for my Life. And when their Prayers prevailed not for his ease, he would be often stilling and quieting himself with this of Holy <hi>Job, What shall I say unto thee,</hi> O <hi>thou Preserver of Men?</hi> One Minute in Heaven will make amends for all this pain.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Fryday</hi> (the <hi>27th)</hi> his pains continued, yet his Doctor said, There was no danger. Towards the Evening he had some intermission, and Read in his own Book, concerning the Immortality of the Soul, and Faiths Triumph over the Fears
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62667:138"/> of Death. That Night some choice Friends sat up with him: when being again Racked with grievous pain, he spake to this purpose, <hi>O! the wonderful Mysteries of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Providence of God! who can see a</hi> Job <hi>cast out upon a Dunghil, filled with Botches and Boiles, forsaken by his Friends, and worried by Satan: and yet at that very time God had not a more choise Servant on the Face of the Earth, nor one more dear unto him then he was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two of his Congregation coming to see him, said, If it should please God to take him away, then they should be a scattered Flock, as Sheep without a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd: To whom he Answered, The great Shepherd of his Flock liveth still, and shall to all Eternity; who, I doubt not, will take care of you.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, (the <hi>29th</hi> Day) his intimate Friend Mr. <hi>O. S.</hi> came, by whose help he made his last <hi>Will and Testament,</hi> Constituting his Wife his sole <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix:</hi> And when he had thus set his House in Order, he took his leave of the World, and told his Wife he had now done with Wife and Children. And being asked how it was with him, as to Soul concerns? he answered, I Bless the Lord, I have no Cloud upon my Spirit, yet if my God should give Satan leave, he may put me into an Agony before I Die. He also repeated that of <hi>Solomon, The Soul knows its own Bitterness, and a Stranger intermedleth not with his Joy.</hi> He told a Minister thus, All my Self-Righteousness I disown, and I trust only unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and hope that I have a Gospel-Righteousness. In the Evening, seeing his wife weep, he said, I pray thee weep not; but (with <hi>Hezekiah)</hi> turn thy Face to the Wall, and Pray.</p>
               <p>That Night as he grew weaker his pains grew stronger; but when an acute pain was over, he would oft say, <hi>Now this pain is over, I shall know it no more.</hi> And to one that stood by, whom he thought not to have walked acuratly, he said, <hi>Now see the benifit of a good Conscience:</hi> when they had given him something to provoke him to sleep, though his Speech was somewhat interrupted with pain and drowsiness; after a little slumber, he said, I long to see a People Rich in Spiritual Graces, as well as in Spiritual Priviledges: But surely God hath here a Peculiar People, a Royal Priesthood, that Serve him Day and Night in Sincerity.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Lords Day</hi> in the Morning, (the <hi>29th</hi> Day) his Wife asking him whether he knew her: what (said he) not know thee: not know my Wife: thou wouldst make me think that I am going to Triumph before I am. Yet was his Triumph not many Hours after: for about One Clock that <hi>Lords Day,</hi> (on which Blessed Days he had used to be much in an Heavenly frame,) this choise Servant of the Lord resigned up his Spirit into the hands of his Heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>After his Death, his Body being opened, there was taken out of his Bladder a Stone in the shape of an Egg, which did then weigh betwixt Three and Four Ounces.</p>
               <p>He Died <hi>October</hi> the <hi>29th, Anno Christi,</hi> 1676. And of his Age, 46.</p>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Mr.</hi> Owen Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>who Died</hi> Anno Christi, 1680.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>OWen Stockton</hi> was Born in the City of <hi>Chichester</hi> in the County of <hi>Sussex,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Birth and Learning.</note>
                  <hi>May</hi> the <hi>31st, Anno</hi> 1630. He was the Fourth Son of Mr. <hi>Owen Stockton,</hi> a worthy <hi>Prebendary</hi> of that <hi>Cathedral,</hi> and was a younger Brother to that ancient Family of the <hi>Stocktons</hi> of <hi>Kiddington-Green</hi> in <hi>Cheshire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the Seventh Year of his Age his Father Died, and left the care of this <hi>Owen,</hi> and his other Children to their Mother, a Pious Gentlewoman of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Tilees,</hi> in <hi>Cambridgshire.</hi> And she being now a Widow, and but a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in <hi>Chichester,</hi> soon after the Death of her Husband, left that City, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into her own Country, and setled her Habitation at <hi>Ely,</hi> where was a very good <hi>Grammar-School,</hi> under the Government of Mr. <hi>William Hitches,</hi> to whose care she commited this her Son, to be Instructed and Educated by him.</p>
               <p>From his very Childhood he was of great Hopes, which yet a little <hi>Grammar-Scholar:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hopefulness.</note> His Ingenuity, and inclination unto Learning, was such, as presaged more then ordinary improvement. Once, accidentally looking into Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> which lay in one of the Churches of that City, and Reading some little part thereof, he was so affected with, and desirous of the fuller knowledg of that History, that he never ceased to importune his Friends, till he had obtained One Volume of it for his use. And having once gotten it, declining all Childrens Recreations which his School-fellows busied themselves in, and for some Years, he spent all his vacant time, and what he could redeem from his School imployment, in reading it.</p>
               <p>His Judicious Master discerning in him a ready natural capacity for Learning, and a desire after it, together with Industry, and diligence in his Studies, (for though he spent so great a part of his time out of School in Reading that Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) yet withal, he so performed his Task and Exercises in the School, as that he never gave occasion to his Master, either to correct, or rebuke him. And also observing his Daily constant attendance upon the Worship of God, according to the Orders of the School: He earnestly commended him to his Mother, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her not to think of any other Trade, or course of Life for him, but that he should be prepared for, and sent to the <hi>Ʋniversity,</hi> in order to the Office, and work of the Ministry.</p>
               <p>Himself also being inclined to it, and was fitted for <hi>Accademical</hi> Studies, in the Sixteen Year of his Age, <hi>Jan.</hi> the 2<hi>d, Anno Christi,</hi> 1645. He was admitted into <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Christs College</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> under the Tuition of the Learned Dr. <hi>Henry Moore.</hi> His Years were not many, but his Stature was much less then others usually are at that Age, so that for some time he could not pass along the Streets without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice taken of him, and expressed upon that account.</p>
               <p>His Residence in the <hi>College</hi> whilst he was an under Graduate, was so constant, <note place="margin">Diligence.</note> that he was not absent a Month in any one of those Years: And such was his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, that he abstained not only from Publick Houses; but in other places and company, from Wine and strong Drink, as judging Nature, in his Age, not to stand in need of such Helps.</p>
               <p>When he had taken his Degree of <hi>Batchelor</hi> of Arts, he resided still in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, seriously applying himself to the study of Divinity, which he always most aimed at, and intended. And in pursuance thereof, he went to <hi>London,</hi> and spent some Months there, acquainting himself with the principal Booksellers, from whom <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Goeth to</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> he took an account of the best Writers in Divinity of that time, frequenting <hi>Sion College Library,</hi> and the Lectures at <hi>Gresham College.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He applied himself also to divers Learned and Worthy Ministers in the City, and attended on their Ministry, and the Morning Exercises, that he might observe the variety of Mens Gifts, and their several <hi>Methods</hi> in Preaching. By these means he <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> made so much improvement of himself, that he often said, That if it should please
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62667:140"/> God to give him a Son, disposed to the Ministry, he would give it him as his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular advice, before he ventured upon the Ministerial Imployment, that he should spend some Months in <hi>London,</hi> attending upon those Learned Divines, which excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Gift of Preaching, wherewith the City is usually well furnished.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Stockton</hi> being much affected, and pleased with these Studies, resolved to <note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>
                  </note> pursue them earnestly, and to prepare himself for the work of the Ministry, he did privatly, and yet in a most solemn, and serious manner, by Fasting and Prayer, make as it were, a Dedication of himself unto God for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>When he was middle Batchelor, he was removed from <hi>Christs College,</hi> and made a <hi>Junior</hi> Fellow of <hi>Gonvile and Caius College,</hi> about the begining of the Year 1651. where, after a Years continuance, and Probation of his worth, he was Translated from that to a <hi>Senior</hi> Fellowship, which also he enjoyed by the space of Six Years, in which time he discharged the Offices of a Steward, of Catechist, and Conduct, to the great benifit and advantage of the whole House.</p>
               <p>And here it was that the Lord trained up this his Disciple to be a <hi>Scribe instructed for the Kingdom of God,</hi> furnishing him so plentifully with Divine and Spiritual Knowledg, that he could readily <hi>bring forth out of his Treasure things both new and old,</hi> which he gained as well by Experience, and Observation of Gods dealing with him, and by the Operation of Gods Spirit upon his Heart, as by Industrious Study and Meditation. He was able to speak pertinently, suitably and seasonably to the various Capacities, Cases and Conditions, both of Saints and Sinners, and become a happy and powerful Instrument in Gods Hand for the Conversion, Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Consolation and Salvation of many Souls.</p>
               <p>His design and desire being to serve the <hi>Lord Jesus Christ</hi> in the Office and Work of the Ministry, he directed the course of his Studies with special respect to that Service. And though his Place, and Exercises in the University obliged him to the Study of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> wherein he was equal to most, yet the Study of Divinity was his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his work: Not satisfying himself with the Reading of the Elaborate Writings of the most Learned Divines, wherewith he furnished his Library at the Expence of some Hundreds of Pounds; yet especially he adicted himself to the Study of the Sacred Scriptures, as containing the whole counsel of God, which, as a Minister, he was to declare unto Men.</p>
               <p>This course of his Studies God so blessed and prospered, that it may be truly said of him, as is said of <hi>Apollos, [Acts</hi> 18. 24.] He was <hi>mighty in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> His Head, Memory, Heart and Tongue were full of the Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath abundantly evinced by his Scriptural Catechism. And in the opening and applying the word of God, his Gift was excellent, and peculiar; so that all that knew him, or that were acquainted with his Discourse, Ministry or Writings, must testifie that with the holy Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he preferred the Learning gotten at the Feet of <hi>Christ,</hi> above all that he had got at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel:</hi> And though he had the valuable accomplishments of other Learning, yet he <hi>determined not to know any thing,</hi> save Jesus Christ, <hi>and him Crucified.</hi> In this Knowledg, he was like to <hi>Saul,</hi> higher then most of his Brethren from the Shoulders, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Probably he propounded to himself for his Pattern, that Eminent and Powerful Servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. <hi>Arthur Hildersam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Knowledg alone is not sufficient for a Minister of the Gospel. He is best accomplished, whose Knowing-Head affects his Heart, and Governs his Life; who knows Revealed Truths, as well by Spiritual Sense and Experience, as by <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Spirit of God is a Spirit of <hi>Truth,</hi> and of <hi>Life</hi> too: Communicates both Grace and Gifts, and teaches as well to Live well, as to Preach well: Both which met together in this excellent Person. <hi>The Word of God dwelt richly</hi> both in his Head and Heart, and was effectually the Law of his Life: He was both <hi>a Burning and a Shining Light.</hi> A Man more then ordinarily mortified to the Pleasures of the Flesh, and to the Vanities of the World: Freely and resolvedly devoted to the Fear of God: His <hi>Conversation was in Heaven:</hi> His Communion with God: His delight in the Saints: His Business was Religion: His Zeal for Holiness: His main Design, the Glorifying God, and the Salvation of his own, and others Souls.</p>
               <p>As for his Practice of Mortification, it cannot be better expressed then in his own words.</p>

And the Scripture which the Holy Ghost set before me for this end, was 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. By the <hi>precious Promises</hi> which are given to us, we <hi>escape the Pollutions that are in the World</hi> through Lust: The other was suggested to me as I was hearing a Sermon, and that was; to be daily applying the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> to my Soul; grounded on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. where the Apostle advises us to <hi>put on the Lord</hi> Jesus Christ, as an help against <hi>Chambring and Wantonness,</hi> &amp;c. The third was suggested to me as I was riding abroad, and discoursing on the things of God, and that was <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the Lusts of the Flesh.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>In the pursuance of these means for the mortifying of the Lusts of the Flesh, I determined with my self to eye the promises of God more frequently then I had done; and to that end, I chose out some Promises that are of daily, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual use; and intended, by the help of God, to salute and embrace them once a day, and not onely to take a vew of them my self, but in my Meditations and <hi>Soliloquis</hi> to spread them before the Lord, and to put God in remembrance of them.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>I determined also, when I should feel the working of any Lust, presently to look up to <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> It being the Remedy which the Holy Ghost prescribes against such Sins as do most <hi>easily beset us (Heb.</hi> 12. 1, 2.)

               <p>This was the wise and Holy method which this faithful Servant and Souldier of of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> prescribed to himself by Divine direction, whereby to manage the spiritual warfare with the sin that <hi>dwelled</hi> in him, that he might not be overcome by it. According to which he also charged himself with the Practice of universal positive holiness, which he expresses in his Diary.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Being (saith he) under the rebukes of God's chastening Providence, I set apart a day to humble my Soul with Fasting and Prayer, that I might obtain from the Lord a sanctified use of mine Afflictions, I sought God to pardon my sins, which were the causes thereof, and to make them work for my good. I spent a good part of the Day in Meditating how I should make a right use of these Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</q>

               <p>

               <p>Thus did this Man of God gird himself with the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> which he faithfully and successfully managed against his Corruptions, and Temptations. Thus did he put on the <hi>Breast of Righteousness, holding the Mistery of Faith in a good Conscience,</hi> applying the Word of God as an inviolable Law, and Rule to his Heart and Life; sincerely aiming at the Glory of God, and the obtaining that Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; which, by the Covenant of God, is secured to the <hi>undefiled in the way who walk in the Law of the Lord,</hi> and by his Life conformable thereunto, demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the strictest Holiness, to be Practicable, Eligible, and Delectable by his own Example.</p>
               <p>But though he was liberally instructed by Nature, Art, and Grace for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and Work of the Ministry; Yet, such low thoughts he had of himself, and such deep affecting apprehensions of the difficulty, and weight of the Work and Office of the Ministry; which, as it is in it self, so it was to him, <hi>Onus tremendum,</hi> a dreadful Burden, and he thought with Saint <hi>Paul, who is sufficient for these things.</hi> And though it was his Design and Desire to serve God and his Church in that great Work, yet he was so discouraged, that he would not (as too many do) hastily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to seek for Ordination, but would first prove himself well, ask Counsel of God and his Word, and to attend a call of God by his Spirit and Providence.</p>
               <p>Being now Master of Arts, he did sometimes exercise his Gifts in some Countrey Villages near to <hi>Cambridge.</hi> And he used privately to enquire what small Parishes were within ten or fifteen Miles of the University and destitute of Ministers. And unto these he Preached, yet with such privacy, as for some time none knew of it but himself and the People to whom he Preached: yet, to many of them, it was a long time unknown from whence he came, and who he was.</p>
               <p>This Service he performed <hi>Gratis,</hi> without exspecting any Reward from Man: Yea, it was some burden to him. Among these Countrey People God blessed his Labours, and gave him the first Fruits of his Ministry, making him Instrumental and Succesful in the Confession, and Edification of many: whereby he was endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, and they to him; that, after he was called to Preach in a Parish in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he would yet go often among them on the week days, sometimes in one Place, and sometimes in another, and the People would lay aside their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Businesses, and readily Travel several Miles to attend upon his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</p>
               <p>Yea, after he was removed some considerable distance from them, into <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> he would for the most part, so long as he lived, go once a Year to visit them, Preaching to them, and Conversing with them.</p>
               <p>After a while that he had thus Exercised his Gifts among this Country People, he observed Three things especially, which much encouraged him wholy to give up himself to the Office and Work of the Ministry.</p>
               <p>First, The benifiting of his own Soul in his Meditations for Preaching. Whilst he was studying for others, the Lord made it a word of Instruction to himself. And he found it the best means of growth, to be watering of others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He found his heart much diverted from other Studies. <hi>Philosophy</hi> was very tedious to him. He found little satisfaction in Humane Authors, not to be compared with Meditation on Divine things. Yea, he desired all other Studies, and they were very unsavory to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lord had been pleased, in some measure to Bless his Labors in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places where he had Preached, and God so ordered it, that it came to his knowledg, which much encouraged him wholy to devote himself to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1654. He was chosen <hi>Catechist</hi> in the College for that Year. In which Election there was a special Providence of God; for whereas before, the Master used to nominate the Fellow to such Offices as they should bear, he, this Year bad the Fellows to agree, and chuse among themselves; which they did, and chose among themselves according to their Seniority. He being absent upon busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62667:142"/> they cast the <hi>Catechist</hi> place upon him, which he accepted of, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly began to discharge it in <hi>Michaelmas Term.</hi> This was the first place where he fell upon a constant course of Preaching: wherein God also much encouraged and Honoured him. For the very first Night that he began his Exercise, one of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows came to him, and told him, that he had felt the Power of God in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon his Heart.</p>
               <p>The Statutes of the College tied him to these Exercises in <hi>Term-</hi>time only, but towards the end of that <hi>Term,</hi> he began to consider whether he should not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue that Exercise as well out of <hi>Term-</hi>time, as in <hi>Term-</hi>time: His Zeal to take all opportunities of doing Good prompting him to it: Whereunto he was much quickned by a Sermon Preached in St. <hi>Maries,</hi> by the Reverend and Learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Tuckney, Professor</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> there, wherein he shewed what a Blessed and desirable thing it was to have the Church of God multiply and encreased, and in his Application, directing his Speech chiefly to the University, he said, That he did earnestly beseech every one of them in their places to endeavor the encrease of the Church of God, both by adding themselves, and endeavouring to add others to it: He looked upon this word as directed especially to himself, and took encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it to proceed chearfully in his work.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Easter</hi> following a motion was made to him by one of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Parish in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> in the name of the rest, to supply that place; this he assented not to, yet he promised to give them a Sermon. But afterward the motion being again renewed with more importunity, he advised them to seek to God for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in a Business of that weighty concernment, commending to them others of greater Abilities, and that had more Grace then himself: Yet he said, He would not at that time neither deny, nor promise any thing. About Six Weeks after there came Eight or Nine of them, in the name of all the rest, importuning him that he would Preach with them on the <hi>Lords Days</hi> in the Forenoon.</p>
               <p>And after a Fortnights consideration, and seeking of God, and consulting Friends, he complied with their desire, and accepted of the Service.</p>
               <p>Here God so Blessed his Ministry, both to the Schools, and People of the Town, that his Encouragement was very great, for which he heartily Blessed God. And in the College he so well acquitted himself, that the Year now expiring, he was again chosen <hi>Catechist</hi> for the Year ensuing.</p>
               <p>And being now satisfied that God called him to the Office of the Ministry, he resolved thoroughly to Devote himself to it by Ordination: For which end he went up to <hi>London,</hi> and being their Proved and Approved of, <hi>[Feb.</hi> 13. 1655.] he was solemnly set apart to this Office by Fasting and Prayer, and laying on of the Hands of the <hi>Presbytery:</hi> To which also God seemed to set to his Seal, both du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Action, by very Gracious Influences of his Spirit upon his Heart, beyond his Preparations: And on the <hi>Lords Day</hi> following, being requested to Preach both parts of the Day at the <hi>Charter-House,</hi> he understood that divers in that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation were much affected with those his first Sermons after his Ordination.</p>
               <p>In his return from <hi>London</hi> he experimented a very gracious Providence of God, with which his Heart was much affected, which was this, The Night overtaking him before he could reach <hi>Hasting-Mills,</hi> (where the Waters were very high by reason of a Flood) just as he came almost to the Water, a Man met him, who knowing the danger, and the safest passage through, offered him his Service, and very kindly lent him his Horse, which was taller, and stronger then Mr. <hi>Stocktons,</hi> and by Riding before him, conducted him safely over, which else he could not have done without the hazard of his Life.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Stockton</hi> being now returned unto his Charge in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> with what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, Faithfulness, Zeal and Diligence, he applied himself to the work to which he had Devoted himself, and was now solemnly set apart for, we may judg by what follows in his own words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> 1656. I set a part that Day for Fasting and Prayer, to seek for Counsel of God, whether I should Preach in the Afternoon at St. <hi>Andrews:</hi> And now my time for Chappel-Exercises being expired, having humbled my self, and sought unto God for direction, I was by Scripture fully perswaded that it was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> the <hi>21st.</hi> 1657. I set this Day apart by Fasting and Prayer, for direction in a Business which had lain upon my Spirit near half a Year, which was, to Preach once a Fortnight on the Week Days in <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> where I was placed: A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

O <hi>thou that bringest good Tidings to</hi> Zion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Scripture I found set home with Life and Power in reference to my present doubt, the rather considering that it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed to such as are sent to Preach the Gospel, by comparing it with <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 7. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15.</p>
               <p>Then did he consider and lay before him sundry Arguments moving him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, and set upon that Lecture. And after these he also set down his Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, which yet he answered and removed, and thereupon set up a Lecture once a Fortnight on <hi>Thursdays</hi> at Three a Clock in the Afternoon: He began it the first <hi>Thursday</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> 1657.</p>
               <p>Though his constant Weekly work at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Church was enough to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise more then ordinary Strength, both of Mind and Body, yet had he many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasions of Services, not only in the College as a <hi>Tutor,</hi> which Trust he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and faithfully discharged, both as to Learning and Religion: But in the Town, where he frequently Preached Funeral Sermons, and <hi>Trinity</hi> Lecture; and in the Country also, where he Preached sundry Lectures, both in the County of <hi>Cambridg</hi> and <hi>Huntington:</hi> All which he performed not in a perfunctory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but as a <hi>Workman that needed not be ashamed:</hi> upon which account he never wanted a full Auditory, as well of Scholars, as of Towns-People. His Sermons were well studied and digested: His Matter substantial and Spiritual; His Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments strong; His Utterance clear, deliberate and grave: His Words apt, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to express the Conceptions of his Mind, He affected not a strain of Words which Mans Wisdom teacheth, nor allowed himself a liberty of Words which Mans indiscretion poureth out.</p>
               <p>In all his Application unto God by Prayer, his Behavior, words and manner of Utterance, bespeak his solemn and affecting apprehensions of the Majesty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of God whom he Worshiped, upon all which Considerations he was <hi>Nulli secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> if not a <hi>None-such</hi> in the University in his Day.</p>
               <p>Scarce Two Months were expired after he had begun his Week-Day Lecture, when the Mayor and one of the Aldermen of <hi>Colchester</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> (whether his Fame reached,) applied themselves to him in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> desiring him to accept their Lecturers place, then void: But he, only so far complied, for the present, as to promise to come over to them, and to Preach a Sermon or two among them; which he performed about Three Weeks after.</p>
               <p>After Preaching, the Aldermen and Common Councel met, and unanimously chose him to that Place. His Work was to Preach on <hi>Lords Days</hi> in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons, and every <hi>Wednesday</hi> in the Morning. He had also the Suffrage of the Godly People in the Town, and Country thereabouts. And as formerly, so here also, he had the same encouragement, God making his first Sermon effectual up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart of a <hi>Dutchman</hi> that lived there: and his Second or Third upon an other Person noted for a Sinner, who came out of Novelty to hear him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom, he might say as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>They shew of us, what manner of entring we had.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it fared heer with him as it did at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he thought he did not work enough, and going freely, offered himself to Preach on the <hi>Lords day</hi> Mornings, at St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s Church, not desiring any Reward for it; And he was a very great Blessing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62667:143"/> to this Town, not onely as to their Spiritual but Temporal concerns also. For it was observed that the during the time of his aboad there, the Town prospered, and flourished exceedingly in Trade. For even the good things of this Life doth the Gospel carry with it.</p>
               <p>Here he laboured faithfully and diligently, till by the <hi>Ast of Uniformity;</hi> he, with the rest of his Brethren, were debarred from the Publick Exercise of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry. Yet thinking himself not bound to be his own Executioner, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mutual Obligations by Contract between the Town and him, that the own should not eject, nor the other desert without so long warning, he continued his publick Preaching, till having occasion to go unto <hi>Cambridge-shire,</hi> in his absence another was put into his place by the B. of <hi>L.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thenceforth (with Saint <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 28. 30.) he dwelt three whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came into him, Preaching the Kingdom of God with all confidence, till God sent the raging Pestilence into the Town, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1665. wherewith he was greatly affected, and seeing many, both of the Shepherds, and of their Flocks hasting their Flight, and many others daily passing into Eternity, he was much moved with compassion, and out of a zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of their Salvation, he sent to the Magistrates, and offered freely, if that they would allow him the liberty of a Publick Church, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having sought of God a right way for himself and Family, he received satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the lawfulness (in the time of the Plague) to remove, from <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 20. <hi>Hide thy self for a little moment,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </gap>moved to <hi>Chattisham</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> about Twelve Miles from <hi>Colchester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being now come to a place where he was a meer stranger, without any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances, and considering the dangerousness of the times, he had many doubts and fears concerning the comfort of his abiding there: But he quickly received sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from the Holy Scriptures, which were his daily delight, a Man of his Counsels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> the <hi>27th,</hi> Being the first <hi>Sabbath</hi> after his coming thither, the Chapter which fell in course for his private Reading, was <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. from whence he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that though God brought the Prophet into a Valley, where were only dry Bones, yet there he had work for him, and made his Labours successful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly God inclined the Heart of these Strangers, not only to respect and honour him, but indulged him the liberty of private Preaching, and opened to him a Door for the frequent Exercise of his Ministry in Publick, which was denied him at <hi>Colchester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Minister of the Parish having another <hi>Cure,</hi> could not attend this but once in a Fortnight, and going, did not only willingly, but thankfully indulge to Mr. <hi>Stockton</hi> the liberty of his Pulpit: And his maintenance being small, and some Burdens lying heavy upon him, after a while he deserted this Place, and wholy left the People to shift for themselves: whereupon, at their request, Mr. <hi>Stockton</hi> supplied that vacancy; and his Zeal provoked others, both Ministers, and People, to do the like. For other Neighbouring Parishes wanting Ministers for want of maintenance, called in the help of <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> who enjoyed the liberty of their Ministry for many Years, if not until this Day.</p>
               <p>When it pleased the Kings Majesty to set forth his <hi>Gracious Declaratìon</hi> for Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Mr. <hi>Stockton</hi> was chosen both by a <hi>Congregation</hi> in <hi>Ipswich,</hi> and by another in <hi>Colchester:</hi> and both being very desirous of him, he undertook half the Service for either, and so, with others divided his Labours between them so long as he lived.</p>
               <p>His Labours were abundant: For besides his Preaching Twice every <hi>Lords Day,</hi> he many times Expounded, and Chatechised the Youth, and resolved Cases of Conscience to such as applied themselves to him for that end. He also Preached a Lecture at <hi>Ipswich</hi> on the Week Day once a Fortnight: And scarce a Week passed, but he assisted at some other Lecture: Or some Funeral Sermon, or help to keep private Fasts at home and abroad.</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:62667:144"/>
               <p> The Providence of God over him was very signal: For notwithstanding his Zeal and Constancy in these Duties, at home and abroad; and the severity of the Laws, the Malice, Watchfulness and Endeavors of his Adversaries, yet God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not an Hair to fall from his Head, the Complaints, Indictments, Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Warrants, Presentments, Excommunications, were made against him, yet was he never imprisoned, Apprehended, Distrained, or brought before any Court, or Magistrate: And he was much affected with this care of God over him, and thankfully accepted and Recorded it, as the Instance of Gods faithfulness, and performance of his Promise, as the answer of his own Faith, and Prayers, and as the Reward of his Love, and Zeal, and Courage for God and his Church: by the Power whereof, he lived above Fears and Dangers. For thus he Writes,</p>

                  <hi>April</hi> the <hi>16th,</hi> 1665. Being the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> I awaked with that Scripture in my Thoughts, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>This is a faithful saying,</hi> &amp;c. I dwelt upon it, and drew comfort and relief for my Faith, through the help of God: The comfort I had, was, That <hi>Christ</hi> came to save the chief of Sinners. That this was a Faithful say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it was worthy of all acceptation, or to be embraced of every one: And that this Salvation was from Sin as well as from Hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. And consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering whether he would save me, I was satisfied from <hi>John</hi> 6. 37. <hi>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

It being a Day of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I was much encouraged to go on in my Calling, though we had many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, from <hi>Verse</hi> 11, 12, 13. Yea, though our Enemies were strong as Lions, as full of Venome as Dragons, as subtle and obstinate as Adders, (see <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 4, 5.) yet the Angels have a charge to keep us in all our Ways: and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is, That we shall trample them under our Feet.</p>

In <hi>Colechester</hi> I enjoyed much Peace and Security; but coming into a strange place, having none to shelter or speak for me, I judged my self to be in more danger: But this word, <hi>The Lord preserveth the Strangers,</hi> did help my dependance upon God.</p>

                  <hi>October</hi> the <hi>28th, Anno Christi,</hi> 1666. Being the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> I went to Preach at <hi>Manytree.</hi> That Morning the Lord gave me in that Promise, <hi>Isa</hi> 55. 12. <hi>Ye shall be led forth with Peace:</hi> It being a time of danger for <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> to Preach in Publick, this Promise was the more precious to me, and I was encouraged to go with the greater confidence. And I determined to Eye this Promise for the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when Probably I should meet with Disturbance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the <hi>25th,</hi> 1665. As I was Reading <hi>Luke</hi> 6. I observed from <hi>Verse</hi> 11, 12. That when <hi>Christs</hi> Enemies were filled with Madness, and sought what they might do unto him, he went up into a Mountain to Pray, and continued in Prayer all Night. Hence I concluded, That it was my Duty to give my self much unto Prayer, as oft as I had Enemies that lay in wait to do me any hurt.</p>
               <p>Within a Day or Two afrer, one of the Constables came unto me, and told me that his Fellow-Constable, when he had drunk somewhat liberally, told him, that there had been some Communication hetween him and one of the Deputy Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, about Presenting me at the <hi>Sessions</hi> for my Meetings. I thought upon the Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 6 11, 12. and went apart to Pray, when he was gone: And whilst I was Meditating on this, God brought into my mind that Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 12. <hi>The Beloved of the Lord shall dwell safely by him,</hi> and I was strengthned in my adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this Promise. And as I was pleading this Promise in Prayer, that passage was sent home to me: <hi>He shall cover thee all the Day long.</hi> And after I had been in Prayer, I considered <hi>Jacobs</hi> carriage, after he had wrestled with God about <hi>Esaus</hi> coming against him, he used means to appease his Brother: So did I to prevent trouble at the <hi>Sessions,</hi> and it pleased the Lord that I heard no more of it: For the Lord made me to dwell in safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the 22<hi>d,</hi> As he was Exercising in his House word was brought him, that the Mayor and Aldermen would come; but being near the end of his Exercise, he soon concluded, and dismissed the Assembly. And presently a Constable came to him, and told him, that he was sent to dissolve his Meeting: But added, that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62667:144"/> he Blessed God, who had given him an Heart to come sometimes to it himself, and his Wife oftner. So that instead of doing him any hurt, he gave Glory to God, that inclined him to be a Hearer himself.</p>
               <p>Octob. <hi>Anno Chisti</hi> 1670. He was presented in the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Court for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but God incouraged him with the Word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 31. And though his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries got an <hi>Excommunication</hi> against him, yet God raised up deliverance for him, that the Court took it off, without his appearing or paying any Fees.</p>
               <p>Yea, so far was he from forbearing to Preach for fear of sufferings, that being once perswaded by his Friends to forbear, many Souldiers being thereabout, who also had newly seised upon Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and imprisoned him; yet all that day, and the night following, was he under much despondency of Spirit, for missing such an opportunity of Service. But it was some stay to his mind, what he Read, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 20. whence he observed that the divulging of the most necessary truth, was at some times prohibited by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he was further satisfied from <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 6, 7. whence he observed, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to Preach the Gospel to some Places, may sometimes arise from the Holy Ghost. At another time, having missed an oppertunity of Service, he thought upon <hi>Psal.</hi> 52. 9. whereby he was convinced that he might praise God for the Providence thus attended with some afflicting circumstances.</p>
               <p>Once a very zealous &amp; active Persecutor of the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> had gotten a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant against him upon the <hi>Oxford Act,</hi> directed to all the chief Constables &amp; petty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables in the County to apprehend him, &amp; accordingly an Officer, a Stranger came to execute it; who, being come near the House, he espied two Men, whom by their Apparel, he judged to be Ministers walking in a Field; the one was <hi>Mr. Stockton,</hi> the other Mr. <hi>Senior</hi> of <hi>Hackney.</hi> He hasted to them, and told them that he had a Warrant againt one of them, but he knew not which.

Some little Girls were nere, who coming to them, clinged about Mr <hi>Senior</hi> as if he had been their Father, which confirmed the Officer in his error.

               <p>In Reading 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 30. <hi>the Realm of</hi> Jehosaphat <hi>was quiet: For his God gave him rest round about;</hi> God caused me to take notice, that my living in rest and quietness was the gift of God, and came to pass by his good Providence, and not from the privicy of the place where I lived, or from the peacable disposition of my Neighbours. I was thence also Instructed, what I should return unto the Lord for keeping me from the Hands of mine Enemies, and giving me Rest and Peace, from <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 1. <hi>I will extol thee (O Lord) for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my Foes to rejoyce over me.</hi> And from <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 7, 8. I saw also that Gods gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me Rest from them, should put me upon doing some special eminent Service, from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 4, 5. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Thus with unwearied Pains and Zeal, in great Peace and Security, with Holy Rejoycing and Thanksgiving, did this Man of God fulfil the Course of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrey.</p>
               <p>Yet he did not satisfie himself with his Work of Preaching, but applied himself also unto writing, for the greater Service of the present, and future Generations: His <hi>Counsel to the afflicted,</hi> and his <hi>Scriptural Catechism,</hi> are already Printed: and tis hoped that some others may see the Light.</p>
               <p>It pleased God in much Mercy and Faithfulness to give him a Meet-help, a most suitable Yoke-fellow, a very Prudent, Virtuous, and Gracious Gentlewoman, of a Worthy and Religious Family in <hi>Cambridg-shire,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Elianor Rant,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Roger Rant,</hi> of <hi>Suaff-ham,</hi> Esq; whom he Married within less than a year after his call to <hi>Colchester,</hi> who was a singular Blessing, Comfort, and Honour to him so long as he lived.

So that mostly he had a full Family; wherein, according to his Place he kept up his Authority over all under his Charge, but with so much Meekness, Prudence, and Gravity, that they all stood in awe of him, yet he was more loved than feared.</p>
               <p>As for his Wife, whom he worthily honoured, and intirely loved, there never arose any Passion, or Dispute between them. He frequently conversed with her about the matters of her Soul: enquiring how the Case stood between God and her Soul: what burthens lay upon her Spirit: what grounded hope she had for Eternal Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> helping, and encouraging her in the ways of Godliness.</p>
               <p>The 9th. day of <hi>June,</hi> being the day of their Marriage, he never passed it over (if at home) without spending sometime with her in solemn Prayer unto God, and conference about the several pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

It was his manner, not onely in his more private, and secret retirements; but also in his Family Duties to commend her in perticuler to God, at the Throne of his Grace.</p>
               <p>As for his Children, very early, even before they were past the lap, he himself, would be instructing of them in Gods Word, ordering them to get some Scriptures by heart, which best suited with their Childhood, and Capacity: Four of them died in their Infancy and Childhood, none having attained the full Age of five years; concerning whom he had much satisfaction as to their Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>His first-born (a Daughter) attained to the Age of nineteen years, and then died; who had been so instructed by her Father, that before she was eight years old, she understood the Method of a Sermon, and if Preached by her Father, would give him an accout of the most considerable Heads and Passages therein, and before she was full nine years old, she would write a Sermon after him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out missing the Heads, with some considerable enlargements also.</p>
               <p>About this time of her Age God suffered her to fall into sin in the open Acts, to the observation of others, which exposed her to the severe Rebuke of her Parents, which God was pleased to sanctifie to her conviction, and as she grew up, she quickly gave evidence of the truth of Grace, and power of Godliness, making progress therein beyond her years, having a very great love to the Ordinances, Ministers, and Servants of <hi>Christ:</hi> And she disembled her weakness and bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, that she might not be kept from the publick Ordinances for the good of her Soul. She walked closly with God in frequent secret Duties, kept the <hi>Lords Days</hi> strictly; took special notice of the workings of Grace, and of sin, and of Gods providential dealings with her, which she recorded in her <hi>Diary:</hi> And under a long and mortal sickness, expressed a most Christian Patience and Submission to the will of God.</p>
               <p>As for his Servants, so soon as they came into his Family, he instructed them; first in their Duty to God, and next in the Duty of their places, giving them. Scriptures for that which he instructed them in, requiring them to get those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by heart, which they were to repeat to him when he called for them.</p>
               <p>In his Family, after his own secret retirements, wherein he read the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in course, and Prayed, Morning and Evening, first and last; his Family be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come together, he began with a short Prayer, then to read a portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which also he oft-times expounded, and so concluded with Prayer. At Night he did the like; onely adding, that every Child and Servant, should repeat a verse of the Chapter which he would open, and explain unto them. Frequently exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to a Reverend demeanour of themselves, in the whole Worship and Service of God.</p>
               <p>Once a week usually he did <hi>Catechise</hi> both his Children, and Servants. And once a fortnight, if some extraordinary occasion put him not by; he opened, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62667:146"/> explained some Principle of Religion in a <hi>Catechistical</hi> way, which his Children and Servants were to give him an account of the next Fortnight. What Sermons they heard, either on the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>days,</hi> or upon other occasions, they gave him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof as they could remember.</p>
               <p>He kept private days of Humiliation with his Family, so often as his publick Imployments would give him leave; wherein he used to deal in perticular with every one, about the concerns of their Souls. He required all in his Family to use secret Prayer as well as to be present at Family Duties. If any of his Brethren came to visit him, he was not content to let him depart without Prayer. His House was an House of Prayer.</p>
               <p>He was a strict observer of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Days,</hi> and took care that all under his Roof should do the same. He kept a severe watch not onely over his Words, and Actions, but over his Thoughts also, not onely when they were vain and sinful, but impertinent to the Holiness of the day, or of the Duties which he was about.</p>
               <p>His Charity was no less abundant then his other Graces; which he accounted one of the best Characters of a Christian; and would say, and that he did not value a Christian by his great knowledg, and eminent Parts, but by his great Charity, and by his love to his Brethren: And herein he observed these Rules.</p>
               <p>Towards those that were at variance one with another: He was an industrious Peace-maker, offering himself to interpose, to make up the breach, and taking Journies, when at a distance, in order to it.</p>
               <p>Towards those that had difference with him about worldly concerns (from which he was not altogether free; though altogether innocent) when he suffered wrong by any, his care was, that they should suffer none by him, or his, either in word or deed; always practising himself and advising others, to return good for evil. He would make the best construction that was possible, of the words and actions of his Adversaries, often making mention of that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Charity thinks no evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Towards his Friends his Friendship was hearty, ingenious, faithful, and open. He received them into his House gladly, entertained them liberally, conversed with them chearfully, simpathised with them in their Afflictions affectionately, and served them as he had occasion industriously.</p>
               <p>Towards those that persecuted him and others for their Consciences, he observed <hi>Christ</hi>'s command <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 44. he affectionatly pittied them, and prayed for them daily; and when he heard any passionate expressions against them for their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he would be offended, and charge People to pray more earnestly for them, and to seek opportunities to do them good.</p>
               <p>Towards thoe that dissented from him in the matters of God, he had a Spirit of meekness and forbearance, imbracing all with Christian love, whose Practice did not destroy their Profession of Christianity. At his first coming to <hi>Colchister,</hi> he found it a very divided place upon the account of divers perswasions among them: yet he so behaved himself with such Humility, Moderation, Tenderness, Brotherly-kindness, and Charitable Judgment; that they were generally united in their respects, and esteem for him. And tho he could not satisfie his Conscience so as to confirm, yet he judged many who did, to be very good Men, and had a real honour for them.</p>
               <p>Towards the Poor, and such as were in streights, he was pitiful. and bountiful. He <hi>devised liberal things,</hi> and <hi>drew out his Soul to the hungry;</hi> wherein he observed <hi>Christ</hi>'s Rule, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. This was one of his great secrets, he did industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously conceal his Charity all that he could.</p>
               <p>The Widdow, the Fatherless, and the Stranger, the Sick and Sufferers, were all refreshed with his compassions. Though he offered to Preach freely at St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s Church in <hi>Colchister,</hi> neither desiring, nor expecting any reward; yet the civility of the People did gratifie him for his pains: The greatest part whereof he disposed to Charitable uses.</p>
               <p>By his own liberality, and by his stirring up others, he promoted the Education of some Poor Schollars, as were hopeful for the Work of the Ministrey.</p>
               <p>In his last <hi>Will and Testament,</hi> out of Love and Zeal for the benifit and good of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62667:147"/> the Church, he hath bequeathed the best part of his well-furnished Library; even the best and choisest of them, to <hi>Gonvil and Caius College in Cambridge:</hi> As also five hundred pounds to be laid out by his Executrix, therewith to purchase a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Estate, or an Impropriation, to be setled on the said <hi>College,</hi> for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of a Schollar and Fellow there for ever. Provided that such onely shall be Elected as are Orphans, or the Sons of poor Ministers, of the best, and most hopeful Parts, tying them to the Study of Divinity, and the Ministerial Work, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king special care that they be well grounded, and established in the Orthodox Faith, and Reformed Protestant Religion; And in case he shall become corrupt in Doctrin, or Scandalous in Life, then after due Admonition, and Non-Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Place to be declared void, and another to be chosen in his stead, and none to enjoy it above Twelve Years.</p>
               <p>Besides which he also bequeathed, in Case his only Daughter should Die before she came to the Age of One and Twenty Years, Twenty Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to be setled upon the College in <hi>New-England,</hi> for the Education of a converted <hi>Indian,</hi> or to any other that will learn the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, and will be a Minister to Preach unto them. And when he heard of that consuming Fire which turned the greatest part of <hi>New-Boston</hi> into Ashes, he sent thither freely, a considerable number of his Books, Entituled, <hi>Counsel to the Afflicted,</hi> to be destributed among the Sufferers.</p>
               <p>He hath also given Twenty Five Pounds to other Charitable uses: which bequests he hath yet made with all due respect to his Family, not failing in his kindness to his Wife, or his tenderness as a Father to his Daughter, so ordering his Charity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others; as with all securing to his Widow, and Fatherless Daughter, not only a Necessary, and Competent, but even a Liberal, and Plentiful means of Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; reserving unto them the Rent of what he hath bequeathed to the College, during their Natural Lives.</p>
               <p>In the last place, there is an account given (out of his <hi>Diary)</hi> of the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Experiences of himself, through which we may look into, the very frame and temper, the thoughts and affections of his Heart, which are largely set down by Mr. <hi>John Fairfax,</hi> in the Life of Mr. <hi>John Stockton;</hi> whereof, for brevity sake, I shall onely give you the Heads.</p>
               <p>His Observations, and Experiences, <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1653. These he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued during his abode at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to the Year 1657. And at his removal to <hi>Colchester</hi> he intermitted it for a time: but resumed it again, in the Year 1662. and continued them to the Year 1676. And this he did that he might always have at hand before him, the manner and Method of Gods dealing with his Soul, the working of Corruption and Grace, his Lapses and Recoveries, his Combats and Victories over the World, Sin and Satan; His Perseverance and Progress in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the secret intercourse between God and his Soul; the withdrawings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of the Holy Spirit; the faithfulness of Gods Covenant; the truth of his Word sensibly felt in his Heart, Food for his Faith, encouragments for his walking with God, with experimental instructions how to comfort troubled Consciences.</p>
               <p>It was his usual manner in Preaching to fore-see, and raise such Objections as troubled Souls usually make against themselves, and to solve them with much clearness and satisfaction; and many applications of such Souls were made to him in private as to a Skilful, Experienced, Spiritual Physitian, whose advice God prospered with his Blessing to the encouragment of the Faith, and hope of many doubting Christians which before walked in darkness; which are here published, not onely as Instances and Demonstrations of that Spirit of Light and Grace, that power of Godliness which possessed, and governed his Heart and Life, and fitted him to be such a useful Instrument for the Service of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Church, upon which account his Memory is worthily honourable, and pretious to all good Men. Especially for the Instruction, Direction, Relief, Support, and encouragment of others that are following him (though at a great distance) in that narrow way which leadeth unto that Life to which he hath attained.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have seen some things of his Conscience of Sin, and Duty, his Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry and Zeal for advancing the Glory of God; his Combats with the Flesh and Satan: his Love to <hi>Christ</hi> and his Church: his Spirituality in Religion: his long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Breathings after God: his remembring God upon his Bed, and meditating
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62667:147"/> upon him in the Night-Watches: His wise Improvement of the Holy Scriptures, His due fulfilling of all Relations: His Holy manner of living to God: From whence we may rationally conclude, That surely he gave this Diligence to the full Assurance of Hope. That he tasted the Consolations of God, and received the Earnest of Glory. That he walked upon the top of <hi>Pisgah</hi> in the Light of Gods Countenance, and in the sight of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Priviledg the God of Peace and Comfort did not deny him. He was a Man, as of much Grace, so of much Peace; an Instance of that word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 165. <hi>Great Peace have they that love thy Law.</hi> He received the Spirit which is of God: and knew the <hi>things which were freely given him of God,</hi> and rejoyced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>As for his Conversion, (which to some who had lived long in Ignorance, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Sensuality, and forgetfulness of God, is very sensible,) yet he being from his Childhood restrained, and well inclined, it was not so remarkable to him. The most discernable part thereof, was, when he was a young Scholar in <hi>Cambridg:</hi> Nor did he then experience very notable Workings of the Spirit of Bondage; which occasioned some trouble to his mind, and he feared that his Humiliation was not deep enough: But he received full satisfaction from a passage in a Sermon Preached by that Eminent and worthy Servant of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Vinee,</hi> then Master of <hi>Pembroke-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He also said sometimes, that he was not much acquainted with those Ravishing Joys which some have felt; but yet had that Comfort and Joy in the Holy Ghost, which gave him good satisfaction.</p>
               <p>He could not satisfie himself with the expectation, nor the apprehension of the immediate, sole Testimony of the Spirit, without the word, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. But he would compare himself with the Word, frequently practising the Duty of Self-Examination, searching for those Graces, Dispositions and Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his Heart, which are promised in the Word, and to which the Promises are made, which the Spirit of God enlightned him to discern, and enabled him in a way of Argumentation, to infer thence his Interest in <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Covenant of God, for his satisfaction and Spiritual Consolation. And the Assurance which he attained in this Method, and by these means, he Recorded in his <hi>Diary,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I shall only give the Heads,</p>

               <p>Thus walked this Eminent Servant of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> in the <hi>Fear of God, and in the Comfort of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Thus he Laboured to approve himself to God, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to his own Conscience: Thus answered he his Profession, Run his Race, pressed forward to the Mark; and he hath left such a Name and Character behind him, as may worthily commend him, both as a Christian, and as a Minister, to the Observation, Honour and Imitation of most, if not of all that Read his Life.</p>
               <p>He left some <hi>Manuscrips</hi> behind him; some of which he entitles, <hi>The best Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest: A Treatise of Glorifying God: The Cure of the Fear of Death.</hi> All which he well understood, not by Speculation only, but by Experience. He who had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the best Interest, and could upon good grounds say: <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> He who aimed at the best End, and Industriously pursued it, <hi>viz: The Glory of God:</hi> was doubtless so fortified with the Grace, Consolation and Covenant of God, as to Tryumph over the King of Terrors. Having the Testimony of his Conscience, that in <hi>Integrity and Sincerity of Heart,</hi> he had fulfilled his general and perticular Calling, and <hi>Served his Generation by the will of God,</hi> and having the assurance of Gods Holy Word for his Reward in a better World, it was no difficult thing for him to Die. He was so far above the fear of Death, that he seemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62667:148"/> unconcerned at it; as to the Terror of it, or Danger after it; and that both in Sickness and in Health.</p>
               <p>In his perfect Health, considering the Evil of the Days wherein he lived, he would often say: <hi>'Tis a good time to Die: I am content to Live, and willing to Die: To me to Live is Christ,</hi> I have no other Design of Life then to serve <hi>Christ.</hi> He Breathed out, with <hi>Greg.

               <p>Such clear apprehensions he had of the Glory of Heaven, and such full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Hope thereof, that (as he told a Friend) he looked upon all that this World could afford, as <hi>Dross and Dung</hi> compared with it.</p>
               <p>As Death was not Terrible, so neither was it unexpected to him. He presaged long before it came. He told his Friend, who frequently conversed with him more then a Year before he Died, that he had apprehensions that he should not live long: And that, for some time past, God had inclined his Heart to Study how a Christian might get above the Fear of Death, and what he found to be his Strength and Comfort against that last Enemy, he had digested into a Method, which, for his own and others use, he had committed it to Writing: And at the same time, he laid an Obligation upon his Friend, (in case he survived him) to Preach his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sermon upon the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 57. as a Testimony of his affectionate and hearty Thanksgiving unto God, who gave him the Victory over the Fear of Death, through <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> our Lord.</p>
               <p>He had a strong Constitution of Body; was very Sober and Temporate, and was then in his full Strength, and the Maturity of his Age, without any sensible Declining. His Natural Temper did somewhat incline him to Feavourish Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And now a Feavor (having a Commission from God) seized on him, <hi>August</hi> the <hi>31st,</hi> which Visitation from God he accepted with all Patience, and Holy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, casting himself on the Care, and resigning himself up to the Will of his Heavenly Father. His Disease increasing, and his Strength declining, he told some about him, That he had had some apprehensions that he should, and that he desired also (if God pleased) to have Died a Martyr, but now he thought he should not: Adding, <hi>God is wiser then I, and knoweth my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He discharged his Dying Office by Grave Exhortations, and Encouragements to seriousness in Religion, and a readiness to suffer for it. He directed his Speech especially to his only Child. He owned and confessed his <hi>Non-Conformity</hi> even to the last, as judging himself obliged thereunto in Conscience towards God: He Blessed God for his invaluable Gift of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to the Children of Men. He Blessed God who had called him to the Honourable Imployment of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Gospel, and had enabled him to be faithful therein; and had encouraged him with his Presence and Blessing under all the Difficulties thereof.</p>
               <p>He Blessed God who had lifted him up above the Fear of Death. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in the Peace and Testimony of a good Conscience, and Hope of the Glory of God: And after Ten or Eleven Days conflict with his Disease, which (after some hope of his recovery) suddenly and unexpectedly seised upon his Head, he quietly slept in the Lord, <hi>September</hi> the <hi>10th, Anno Christi,</hi> 1680. and in the One and Fiftieth Year of his Age.</p>
               <p>This was that Blessed <hi>Exit</hi> of this Eminent Saint and Servant of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who might say to those whom he hath left behind, as his Dying Saviour did to the Daughters of <hi>Jerusalem, Weep not for me:</hi> I have Died in Peace; am entred into Peace; am at <hi>Rest in my Bed;</hi> have passed through <hi>Jordan,</hi> and am come into <hi>Canaan.</hi> I am beyond Sin and Sorrow, Trouble and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Am come <hi>to the Heavenly</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>to an innumerable Company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> &amp;c. To that Eternal <hi>Sabbath</hi> that remains to the People of God.</p>
               <p>May we not also add, <hi>Weep for your selves.</hi> You shall see my Face no more; enjoy Communion with me no more: You shall hear my Voice no more: <hi>I</hi> shall Dispence the Gospel to you no more. Ye shall come unto me, but I shall return unto you no more. Oh! what is the meaning of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62667:148"/> this dark Providence, that in such a Day as this, God should call from his Work, One so fully Instructed; so willing to serve him and his Church in the Gospel of his Son?</p>
               <p>Whether God hath done this in his just Displeasure, for the unprofitableness unthankfulness, and itching Ears of those that enjoyed him. Or whether to warn us of some approaching Dreadful Judgment, from which he hath hid this, and many other of his Faithful, Able and Painful Servants in the Grave, it concerns us seriously to consider, and to lay it to Heart, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Mr.</hi> Thomas Gouge, <hi>who Died</hi> Anno Christi, 1681.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Thomas Gouge,</hi> was the Eldest Son of Dr. <hi>William Gouge,</hi> an Ancient <note place="margin">
                     <hi>His Parentage, Birth and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, at</hi> Eaton <hi>and</hi> Cambridg.</note> and Eminent Minister in the City of <hi>London,</hi> when he was Pastor of the Church of Christ in <hi>Black-Friars,</hi> for about the space of Forty Six Years.</p>
               <p>This our <hi>Thomas</hi> was Born at <hi>Bow,</hi> near <hi>Stratford,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex, September</hi> the <hi>19th, Anno Christi,</hi> 1665. His Father was very careful that he might be well trained up both in Religion and Learning, and for that end, so soon as he was capable, he placed him in <hi>Eaton-School:</hi> And after he had finished the course of his Studies there, he was chosen from thence into <hi>Kings College</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> being then about Twenty Years old, which fell out to be <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1626.</p>
               <p>Having continued in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and followed his Studies, till he had taken his Degrees of Batchelor, and Master of Arts, his Reverend Father thought fit to withdraw him from the University, and so leaving the College, and his Fellowship, he came home.</p>
               <p>Not long after his return he was Presented to a Living at <hi>Colsden</hi> near <hi>Croydon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>At</hi> Colsden.</note> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> where he continued not above the space of Two or Three Years, but from thence was removed to the great and Populous Parish of <hi>Sepulchres</hi> in <hi>London, Anno Christi,</hi> 1638. And being well setled there, the Year <note place="margin">Sepulchres.</note> following, he thought fit to change his Condition, by entring into a Married Estate, and after good advice, with the consent of Parents, he was Matched into a very
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62667:149"/> Worthy and Ancient Family, Marrying one of the Daughters of Sir <hi>Robert</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marriage.</note>
                  <hi>Darcy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this place he did with great Labour, Diligence and Faithfulness, perform all <note place="margin">His Industry.</note> the Offices and Doubts belonging to, and required of a Minister of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> for about the space of Four and Twenty Years, till that Fatal <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Day came, which made a Divorce between so many Pastors and their People.</p>
               <p>During his Abode in that Parish, he was indefatigable in the exercise of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, Preaching Twice every <hi>Lords Day,</hi> besides Monthly Fasts, which continued for some Years, Funeral Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was also very diligent and Charitable <note place="margin">Charity.</note> in visiting the Sick, to whom he Ministred, not only Spiritual Counsel and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for the good of their Souls, but likewise liberally relieved the Wants and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of those that were Poor, and destitute of Means wherewith to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in that condition.</p>
               <p>Every Morning also throughout the Year he <hi>Catechised</hi> in the Church, especially <note place="margin">Labors.</note> the Poorer sort, who were generally the most Ignorant, and to encourage them to come thither to be Instructed by him, he used once a Week to distribute Money among them, yet not upon a certain Day, but changing it on purpose, as he thought best, that so thereby he might engage them to attend every Day.</p>
               <p>These were chiefly the more Aged Poor, who being past their Labour, had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> enough to attend upon this Exercise. As for the other sort of Poor, who were well able to Work for their Living, he set them on Work at his own Charge, Buying Flax and Hemp for them to Spin, and what they Spun he took off their Hands, paying them for their Work, and then got it Woven into Cloth, and Sold it as he could, chiefly among his Friends, himself bearing the whole loss there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>And this was a very wise and well chosen way of Charity, and in the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it, a far more excellent and useful way of Charity, then if he had given freely, and for nothing, to those very Persons so much Weekly as they Earned by their Labour. For by this way he took many off from Begging, and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued them at once from Two of the most dangerous Temptations of this World, <hi>[Idleness and Poverty,]</hi> And by degrees reclaimed them from an Evil, to a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Industrious course of Life, which enabled them afterwards to Live without being beholden to the Charity of others.</p>
               <p>Thus we have heard something of his Charity in his Younger Days, we shall hear much more of it, as he grew to greater Maturity, at which time most Men grow more Worldly and Covetous. But in the mean time let us take notice of some other Gifts and Graces which shone forth in his Life and Conversation. <note place="margin">Graces.</note> And</p>
               <p>First, For his Piety towards God, which is the necessary Foundation of all other <note place="margin">Piety.</note> Graces and Vertues; it was vere great and Exemplary, yet withal still and quiet, without any great stir or ruffle in the World: Indeed, much more in Substance and Reality, then in Shew and Ostentation. It did not consist in Censuring and finding Fault with others, but in a due Care and Government of his own Heart <note place="margin">Humility.</note> and Life, and in exercising himself continually, to have a <hi>Conscience void of Offence, both towards God, and towards Men:</hi> In which he was so good a President, that those which had long acquaintance, and familiar Conversation with him, could not easily Observe any thing that was Blameworthy in him.</p>
               <p>He more particularly excelled in the more peculiar Vertues of Conversation, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Modesty,</hi> &amp;c.</note>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> In Modesty, Humility, Chearfulness, and in Kindness and Charity towards all Men.</p>
               <p>So great was his Modesty, that it never appeared by Word or Action, that he <note place="margin">Modesty.</note> put any value upon himself, or hunted from any applause from Man; and this was very Observable in him, That the Charities which were procured chiefly by his Interest and Industry, where he had occasion to speak, or to give an account of them, he would rather impute it to any one that had but the least hands and part in the procuring of them, then assume any thing of it to himself.</p>
               <p>Another instance of his Modesty, was, That when he was ejected out of his Living of <hi>Sepulchres</hi> Parish, he forbore Preaching, saying, That there was no need of his Labours in <hi>London,</hi> where there were so many Godly, Able and Painful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to carry on that Work.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:62667:150"/>
               <p> According to the Apostles Exhortation, <hi>He was Clothed with Humility,</hi> and had <note place="margin">Humility.</note> in a very Eminent degree that Ornament of a <hi>meek and quiet Spirit,</hi> which, St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>is in the sight of God of great Price:</hi> so that there was not the least appearance, either of Pride or Passion in any of his Words or Actions. He was not only free from Anger and Bitterness, but from all affected Gravity and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosness. <note place="margin">Affability.</note> His Society and Converse was affable and pleasant. He had a very great serenity of Mind, and evenness of Temper, which was visible in his very Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. He was very rarely Merry, yet never Melancholy and Sad; and so far as could be discerned, by some who had intimate acquaintance with him, he was upon all occasions and accidents, <hi>Semper idem,</hi> always the same, constantly Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ever Courteous and Kind, of a Disposition ready to embrace and oblige all Men; allowing others to differ from him even in Opinions that were very clear to him, and provided Men did but fear God, and work Righteousness, he loved <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> them heartily, how different, soever from him in Judgment about things less ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
               <p>But that Vertue which of all did shine brightest in him, and was his most proper <note place="margin">Charity.</note> and peculiar Character, was his chearful and unwearied D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>igence in promoting Works of Charity.</p>
               <p>A while after the <hi>London</hi> Ministers, among many Hundred of others, were eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their Places, and thereby deprived of the means of Subsistence for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and Families, Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> with Two or Three of his Brethren, applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to many Worthy and Charitable Citizens, of whom they received some considerable Sums of Money, whereby they relieved the Necessities of such as were in present Want. And this course they continued for some Years, till that Charity was diverted into other Channels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1671. When the Life of that Eminent Minister and Servant of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> Mr. <hi>Joseph Alleine</hi> was first Printed, he hearing that I was in <hi>London,</hi> came to me, and told me that he had been Reading that Life, and therein meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that passage, <hi>(Page</hi> 33.) That Mr. <hi>Alleine</hi> had an Eye to poor <hi>Wales,</hi> and had an influence upon the sending of some Ministers to them. And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to have gone, and to have spent some time among them himself. And by all the disswasions of his Friends, for his great Weakness, and unfitness for Travel, he was hardly with-held from his purpose.</p>
               <p>Reading this, (said Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> to me) it hath set me all on fire, with Zeal to prosecute that design: and God seems (in some measure) to have fited me for it, having taken away my Wife: and his Children, being grown up, were disposed of in the World; and he was left alone; and God had given him a competent Estate where withal to defray the Charges of his Undertaking. Having heard his Reasons, I encouraged him in the Work, and left him till his Thoughts were brought to more maturity.</p>
               <p>About a Quarter of a Year after, (if I mistake not the time) he began his first <note place="margin">
                     <hi>His first Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into</hi> Wales.</note> Jorney into <hi>South-Wales,</hi> and in every Town where he came, he enquired what Poor People there were that had any Children whom they were willing to have taught <hi>English,</hi> and to Read and Write, and to learn the <hi>Catechism:</hi> And where he met with a competent Number, he enquired for fit Persons to Instruct them: A Man for the Boys, and a Woman for the Girls, and agreed with them, as afore, for a Penny or Two Pence a Week, which he undertook to pay.</p>
               <p>At his first going, he spent most of his time in the Borders and Skirts of <hi>Wales,</hi> Bordering upon <hi>England,</hi> where many could speak, and understand <hi>English,</hi> and therefore he Preached as he went up and down among them, where he could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But he had not long continued this Practice, before Satan, (who is an <hi>inveterate,</hi> and implacable Enemy to the Preaching of the Gospel,) stirred up some to molest, and impede him in this so free, and Charitable a Work.</p>
               <p>Whereupon a <hi>Citation</hi> was sent out, requiring him to appear in the Bishops <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> Citation <hi>sent out.</hi>
                  </note> Court at such a time and place. But Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> thought fit to anticipate that time, going to the Bishops of his own accord, desiring to know of him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that <hi>Citation:</hi> He Answered, For Preaching without his Licence. Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> replied, That he had a Licence for all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> The Bishop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, Who had given him such a Licence? He answered, The University of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62667:150"/>
                  <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and withal shewed his Licence. Upon this the Bishop discoursed with him in a friendly manner, and stayed him at Dinner, after which he departed friendly from him, thinking that he should hear no more of that matter.</p>
               <p>But when the Court met, Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> was called for, and upon his Non-appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <note place="margin">Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

               <p>After he had made Three or Four Jorneys into <hi>South-Wales,</hi> some in <hi>North-Wales</hi> hearing of it, sent some unto him, requesting him to come into their parts to carry on the like Excellent and Charitable Work among them also. This he assented to, and went, at least once, if not oftner, into those Parts likewise.</p>
               <p>When Mr <hi>Gouge</hi> was engaged in this Pious, Necessary and Charitable Work, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Want of Books in</hi> Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> one thing did much Impede, and obstruct his Progress therein, which was want of Bibles, and other Books of Piety and Devotion, in the <hi>Welch Language,</hi> for the use and behoof of such as understood not the <hi>English Tongue.</hi> This made him look about where, and what <hi>Welch Bibles</hi> could be had, and upon diligent enquiry, he could find but about Twenty in all <hi>London,</hi> and some few in <hi>Oxford.</hi> The reason of which scarcity, perhaps was this;</p>
               <p>It hath been Observed, That the Scriptures were Translated into Two and Thirty Languages before they were Translated into <hi>Welch,</hi> which was not don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> till the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of Blessed Memory, by the Care and Industry of Bishop <hi>Hanmer:</hi> And about Fifty Years ago, when I lived upon the Borders of <hi>Wales,</hi> there were only Two Men that could Preach in <hi>Welch,</hi> neither could many of the common People at first understand them, the Scripture <hi>Phrase</hi> and <hi>Dialect</hi> being grown so much out of use.</p>
               <p>It was a great work incumbent upon Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> not only to have poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren taught to Read and Write, and to be carefully Instructed in the Principles of Religion, but the Persons of grown Age, the Poor especially, should be furnished with necessary helps, and means of knowledg, as the Bible, and other good Books, in their own Language: Among which were, the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> the <hi>Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,</hi> the <hi>Duty of Man,</hi> with some other Pious and Useful Treatises, of which he caused a great number to be Translated and Printed, and to be sent down to all the chief Towns in <hi>Wales,</hi> to be Sold at easie Rates to those that were able to Buy them, and to be freely given to such Poor as were not able.</p>
               <p>In both these Designs, through the Blessing of God upon his unwearied Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, he found very great and good success. For by the large and bountiful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, which chiefly by his Industry, and Prudent Application, were obtained from Charitable Persons of all Ranks and Conditions: From some of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Wales,</hi> and of the Neighbouring Counties, and of several of that Quality in and about <hi>London:</hi> As also from some of the Reverend Bishops and Clergy: And from that Inexhausted Fountain of Charity, [The City of <hi>London,]</hi> led on and encouraged by the most Bountiful Example of the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, and Court of Aldermen; to all which he constantly added Two Thirds of his own Estate, (which was very considerable,) I say, By all these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there were every Year, Eight Hundred, and sometimes a Thousand, Poor Children Educated, as afore is expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed. And by his Example and Perswasions with the Magistrates in all the chief Towns in <hi>Wales,</hi> he prevailed with them to maintain and bring up, at their own Charges, the like number of Poor Children, and under his Inspection and Care.</p>
               <p>He also gave a very great number of the Books, afore spoken of, both in the <hi>Welch,</hi> and in the <hi>English</hi> Tongues, to such of the Poorer sort as were unable to Buy▪ and willing to Read, and make use of them. But that which was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est work of all, and amounted indeed to a mighty Charge, was this,</p>
               <p>He procured a new and very fair Impression of the Bible, and Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Welch</hi> Tongue, to the number of Eight Thousand: One Thousand whereof were freely given to the Poor, and the rest were sent to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Principal Towns in <hi>Wales,</hi> to be Sold to the Rich at very reasonable and low Prizes, <hi>viz.</hi> at Four Shillings apiece, well Bound, and Clasped, which was much Cheaper then any <hi>English</hi> Bible, that was of so fair a Print, and Paper, was ever Sold for.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:62667:151"/>
               <p> A Work of that Vast Charge, that it was not likely to have been done any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and for which Work, not only the present, but the succeeding Age al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, will have great cause to Bless and Praise God on his behalf.</p>
               <p>In these Pious and Charitable Imployments, he laid out most of his Time, and Pains, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his whole Heart was in them, insomuch as he was not much affected with matters of less concernments. He seldom minded, or <hi>(Athenian-</hi>like) wasted his precious time in telling of, or enquiring after News: or if he did mind them, he seldom talked of them. His afore-mentioned Work was that which he laid to Heart, and about which his thoughts were busied; and knowing that it was agreeable to the Will of his Heavenly Father, it was <hi>his Meat and Drink</hi> to be doing of it: And the good success which God gave him in it, was to him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feast, and gave unto him a perpetual Serenity, both of Mind, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, <hi>[Sinceritas Serenitatis, Mater. Aug.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His great Love and Zeal to this Work, made all his Labour and Pain, yea, and all the Difficulties which he met with in carrying it on, to seem as nothing to him. Yea, he would rise early, and sit up late, to advance it, and continued this Pains, Diligence and Industry, to the last of his Days, though he was then in the Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and Seventeenth Year of his Age.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> that he might manage the Distribution of this great Charity with his own Hands, and see the good effect of it with his own Eyes, he always Once, but for the most part Twice a Year, at his own Charges, traveled over a great part of <hi>Wales,</hi> (none of the best Countries to Travel in,) but for the Love of God, and Mens Souls, he endured that, together with extremity of Heat and Cold, (both which in their several Seasons there, are very great,) not only with Patience, but with great Pleasure. These things being seriously considered, will <note place="margin">Patience.</note> evidently shew how careful he was to imitate, and to tread in the steps of his great Lord and Master, <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> of whom it is Recorded, <hi>That he went about conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually doing Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have heard a brief account of the Life and Labors of the Reverend, Mr. <hi>Thomas Gouge,</hi> who after all his Pains and Travels, Died in his Sleep, without <note place="margin">His Death.</note> any sensible Pain or Sickness, <hi>October</hi> the <hi>29th, Anno Christi,</hi> 1681. and in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Seventh Year of his Age.</p>
               <p>Indeed few there are, (yet I have known some,) that desire a suddain Death, as fearing that they were not so suffifliently prepared for Death as they desired, and should be: But to him, the constant imployment of whose Life, was the best preparation for Death that was possible, no Death could be suddain: Nay, it more suddain, by so much the more easie it was. For thereby he was freed from those Pangs and Pains; from those Sighs, and Sobs, and Groans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which most endure in the Agonies of Death. As if God had designed thereby to begin the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the great Pains of his Life, by affording him an easie Death.</p>
               <p>And indeed it was rather a Translation than a Death: And saving that his Body was left behind, what was said of <hi>Enoch,</hi> may not be unfitly applied to this Pious and Worthy Servant of God, with respect to the suddainness of his Change; <hi>That he walked with God, and was not; for God took him.</hi> And it may be said of him, as it is of <hi>David: After he had served his Generation, according to the Will of God, he fell a Sleep,</hi> Acts 13. 26.</p>

                     <hi>HUgh Kennedy,</hi> though he was no Minister, yet was he an Eminent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of promoting the work of the Gospel in the place where he lived. He was <hi>Prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>One Day, being for many Hours alone in Prayer, while some of his Christian Friends did wait long for him, at last he came forth with an unusual chearfulness, and his Friends enquiring of him the reason of it, he said, <hi>That it was no wonder, for he that Day had obtained mercy of God for himself, and all his:</hi> which also came to pass, for there was not one of his Children but in the Judgment of Charity was truly Godly. Whilst he was Dying, Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> a godly Minister said to him, you have cause Sir to be assured that the Angels of God are waiting about your Bed to convey your Soul into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosom: to whom he answered: <hi>I am sure thereof; and if the walls of this House could speak, they could tell how many sweet Days I have had in secret Communion with God, and how Familiarly he hath dealt with my Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Bruse,</hi> the Morning before God took him away (his sickness being mostly a weakness through Age) came to break his Fast at his Table, and having (as he used) eaten an Egg, he said to his Daughter, <hi>I think I am yet hungry, bring me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Egg,</hi> but presently after, falling into a deep Meditation, after he had mused a while, he said, <hi>Hold Daughter, hold: my Master calls me,</hi> with which words his Sight failed him: whereupon he called for a Bible, but finding his Sight gone, he said, <hi>turn me to the Eighth Chapter of the Epistle to the</hi> Romans, and set my Finger at these words, <hi>I am perswaded that neither Death not Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall be able to seperate me from the Love of God, which is in</hi> Christ Jesus <hi>my Lord:</hi> Now said he, is my Finger upon them? And when they told him it was, without speaking any more he said, <hi>Now God be with you my Children: I have Breakfasted with you, and shall Sup with my Lord</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>this Night,</hi> and so he gave up the Ghost, Death shutting up his Eyes that he might see God.</p>

                  <head>Of Mr. <hi>John Scrimger.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>John Scrimger</hi> was Minister at <hi>Kinghorn:</hi> At which time there was a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Woman under his charge, who fell sick of a very lingring Disease, and was all the while assaulted with strong Temptations that she was a Cast-away. Master <hi>Scrimger</hi> often Visited her, Conferred with her, and Prayed over her: yet did her trouble still remain, and the terrours of the Almighty lay upon her. When she drew near to the time of her Dissolution, she being worse, both in Body and Soul, and sending for Mr. <hi>Scrimger,</hi> he took two of his Elders with him, and in their presence first endeavoured to comfort her, both by Exhortations and Conference, and then Prayed with her, and seeing that the nearer she was to her end, the worse
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62667:152"/> she was, he caused his Elders to Pray with her, after which himself Prayed again. But Satan still raged more and more, and her <hi>Soul was far removed from Peace.</hi> Hereupon he sat musing for a while, and then said: <hi>What is this? Our laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her grounds of Comfort will not do it, Conference will not do it, Prayer will not do it, we must use another Remedy. Sure I am, that this is a Daughter of</hi> Abraham: <hi>Sure I am, that I am the Elder: Sure I am, that she hath sent for me: And therefore in the Name of God the Father of our Lord Jesus</hi> Christ, <hi>who sent him to redeem Sinners in the Name of</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>who obeyed the Father, and came to save us: In the Name of the Holy and Blessed Spirit our Quickner, and Sanctifier, I the Elder command thee a Daughter of</hi> Abraham <hi>to be loosed from these Bonds;</hi> and immediatly Peace and Joy succeeded.</p>

                  <head>Of Mr. <hi>Robert Blair.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>Robert Blair</hi> in his Younger Days out-ran many others in his Studies. It pleased God to convert him by the Ministry of Famous Mr. <hi>Trochrig,</hi> into into whose hands (said he) it pleased God to put the Key that first opened my Heart. When he first began to Preach, by a remarkable Providence, he had Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> (before mentioned) to be his Hearer; and indeed, he was desirous to have the Judgment of so great a Man about his Discourse, to whom Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> said, <hi>I found your Sermon very well polished, and digested</hi> (which indeed was easie to one of his Parts) <hi>But there is one thing I missed in it; namely, the Spirit of God, that I found not.</hi> This made a great Impression upon Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> and did him much good all his Life after, as himself oft acknowledged. For divers Years he was a <hi>Regent</hi> in the Colledg of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where he made it his work to train up those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his charge in the Study of godliness, as well as of humane learning: But by reason of the prejudice of some that had Power in that place, he could not stay there long. Upon the Report of a sinful Oath that was to be pressed upon the Masters of the Colledg, he enquired of one of his Fellow <hi>Regents,</hi> what he would do in that matter: his name was <hi>Gawin Forsyth,</hi> who thus answered: <hi>By my Faith I must live.</hi> Sir, (said Mr. <hi>Blair)</hi> I will not swear by my Faith as you do, but truly I intend to live by my Faith. You may chcose your own way, but I will adventure upon the Lord: That wretched man (to whom the matter of an Oath was a small thing) continued in the Colledg after Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> was gone: But many Years after Mr. <hi>Forsyth</hi> fell into such Poverty that he was forced to Petition the General <hi>Assembly</hi> for some Relief, at which time Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> was Moderator, and upon his appearing in so deplorable a condition, he could not but recall that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer passage, and upon his Adress to him in private, he minded him thereof, yet with great tenderness, not in the least to upbraid him with his low Condition, but to let him see that he had been carried through by his Faith, at which <hi>Forsyth</hi> had formerly scoffed.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> was put from the Colledg, he went to his Brother then Minister at <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> to whom he confessed, that by the way, he could not but sing for Joy in the remembrance of Gods being with him, and helping him to be Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental for the good of the young Men committed to his charge. Afterwards he went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> having a Call to <hi>Bangor,</hi> and upon the sight of Land, his Heart was made to leap within him for Joy, so far, that (as himself professed) he was scarce able to bear it. When he came near to <hi>Bangor,</hi> he had a strong impression upon him that the Dean of <hi>Bangor</hi> was sick unto Death, and should rise no more, which at first he rejected as an impertinent suggestion; but going forward, it was with such power impressed upon his Spirit, as forced him to take notice of it. When he came thither he found indeed that the Dean was sick, and though he was a naughty Man, yet he made Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> very welcome, and encouraged him to hold on in his way, and told him that he was to succeed him in that charge: Yea, he spake so unlike himself, and in a strain so different from what was his usual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that a Gentlewoman standing by, said to some others, that an Angel spake out of the Deans Bed to Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> thinking that it could not proceed from such a Man.</p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:62667:152"/>
                  <p> Whilst Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> was a Regent in the College, once the Devil appeared to him like a crooked Boy that waited on him, and laughed in his Face, whilst he was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in his Chamber, but presently disappeared.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was in <hi>Bangor,</hi> there was one in that Parish, who carried over into <hi>Scotland</hi> some Horses to sell; and at a Fair met with a Man that was willing to buy them all: But pretending that he had not Money to pay for all at present, he gave him his Bond to pay at <hi>Martlemass:</hi> The poor Man, suspecting nothing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, and near unto that time, one Night as he went homeward from <hi>Bangor,</hi> his Merchant met him; who was the Devil. Now (said he) you know my Bargain how I bought you at such a place, and I am come as I promised to pay you the price. Bought me? Said the Man, trembling: You bought not me, but my Horses. Nay (said the Devil) you shall know that I bought your self: And speaking farther to this poor Man, who was confounded with fear, he said, you must kill some body or else I will not free you, and the more excellent the Party is, the better it will be for you, and in perticuler he mentioned Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> to him. The Man being overcome with terrour, and by the violence of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, resolved to do it, and went to Mr. <hi>Blairs</hi> House, having a Dagger in his right hand, hid under his Cloke, and was endeavouring to get it out: But after Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> had for a while talked with him, he fell into an extream trembling, and upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiring what was the cause of it: he freely confessed for what end he came, and how he had endeavoured to draw his Dagger, but could not, and knew not what hindered: For now assaying to do it, it came out very easily. Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> Blessing the Lord for his deliverance, exhorted him to make God his refuge: Yet, afterwards he was much threatned, and terrified by the Devil, but nothing more followed.</p>
                  <p>After some time Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> with some of his Worthy Brethren, were silenced by B. <hi>B. Ecklin,</hi> who in the Church of <hi>Bangor</hi> did himself pronounce the Sentence, whereupon Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> rose up publickly in the Congregation, and with great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority did Cite the B <hi>B.</hi> to appear before the Tribunal Seat of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to answer for what he was doing contrary to the Light of his own Conscience against such whom he knew to be faithful Ministers of the Gospel; whereupon the B. <hi>B.</hi> was so astonished that he cryed out, <hi>I appeal from the Tribunal of God's Justice to the Throne of his Mercy:</hi> To whom Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> replied, <hi>Sir, your Appeal is rejected: For you know that what you are doing is directly against your Conscience: which hath made you to bear witness to us as the Servants of</hi> Jesus Christ. A few Months after the B. <hi>B.</hi> fell sick, and that Physitians enquiring of him what was the cause, he could only say, <hi>my Conscience,</hi> and so Dyed.</p>
                  <p>Whilst they were under restraint, Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> was by his Brethren sent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to Petition the King for their Liberty: and as he was upon the way, he was taken with an extream fit of the Stone, which made him lye upon his Horses neck, not being able to sit upright, which much troubled him, beinga hindrance to him in so important a business: Hereupon he applied himself to God in Prayer, and immediatly after, trying if possibly he could lift up his Back, he found to his asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment his tormenting pain quite gone, and that he had perfect ease, nor did it return upon him for two Years after.</p>
                  <p>A few Days after, in the same Journy, his Horse fell very lame, which much troubled him, having no opportunity to provide himself of another: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon also he made his Addresses unto God by Prayer, which the Lord graciously inclined his Ear unto, so that his Horse was (to his amazoment) perfectly cured, and without halting at all carried him to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he came to <hi>London,</hi> he endeavoured what he could to dispatch his business, but could get no access to the King: Yea, some that were his Friends at Court, after tryal, assured him that he could have no ground of hope to speed therein, Yet he resolved not to give over, but to cast the business upon the Lord: for whose Service onely he was importuning for an open Door. One Day going to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where the Court then was, and being weary of waiting without success, he retired into the Park to Pray, and after much wrestling with the Lord, he had so clear a return that he could not but be assured that his way should be succesful: Yet, the appearance thereof being in an ordinary way so unlikely; he, in an humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner begged a sign of the Lord, and immediatly after the wind blowing hard,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62667:153"/> which made a Noise among the Rushes, so great a Calm did suddenly follow, that not the least Plant did move or stir. Thence he went back to <hi>London,</hi> and within a few Days (in a strange manner) had his Petition presented to the King, who accepted of it, and in St. <hi>James</hi> his Park called for him, and with his own hand the King did not only Sign it, but Wrote in the Margin these Words, directed to the Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland, Indulg the Education of these Ministers: For they are</hi> Scotch<hi>-Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilst he was in <hi>England</hi> he had a strong discovery concerning the Death of his Wife, who was a very Gracious Woman, and of her lying in such a Bed, and of a Christian Friend being by her, who was his perticular acquaintance: When he came Home he found his Wife well, but a little after she fell sick, and Died in the same Bed, with that Friend sitting by her, and with all the other particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>

                  <head>Of Mr. <hi>Andrew Steward.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere was in <hi>Ireland</hi> an Exercise held, whereunto a great Multitude of the choisest Christians in those parts Assembled, and while Mr. <hi>Andrew Steward,</hi> Minister of <hi>Dunagor,</hi> was Feeding his Flock in a large place (for the numerousness of the Hearers Imposed a Necessity upon him to Preach in the Field) an Horrid Black Cloud, and fearful to look upon, hung directly over their Heads, which, to all present, Threatned a strange pouring down of Rain, whereby the Exercise would have been interrupted: Yea, some drops began to fall: But Mr. <hi>Steward,</hi> being much enlarged in his own Spirit, craved their patience whilst he retired a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another place to Pray: And whilst he was Praying it was Observed, that the Cloud removed about half a Mile off to the <hi>Southward,</hi> and there fell in so mighty a Rain, as (though it was in Summer) it caused the Brooks so to swell, that some who came later then the rest, could not get over, but where they were Assembled there fell not a drop, so that he had opportunity to proceed with a full Gale, to the close of the work of the day, to the great Benefit and Conviction of the Hearers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno Christ,</hi> 1634. Mr. <hi>Steward</hi> being Invited to the Funeral of that Excellent Man of God, Mr. <hi>Josiah Welch,</hi> the Son of that great Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he stood silent for a time at the Grave as a serious Observer of that sad dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: Some that stood by, said, God knows who will be next, and when none Answered, he said, <hi>I do know,</hi> and so turning away, he went home to <hi>Dunagor</hi> a Foot, and entring into the Church, he Bolted the Door to him, where he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about Two Hours, and then going home to his House, he fell asleep on his Bed through Excess of Grief, from whence he did never arise in Health, but was Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Day Month.</p>
                  <p>When his Wife came home, whom he had left with Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> his Widow, she asked him what he had been doing? He Answered, I have been taking my leave of the Church of <hi>Dunagor,</hi> and I was there calling the Stones and Timber to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that in my short time I had laboured to be Faithful; and that, according to my Light, I have Revealed the whole Counsel of God to the People. After he had lain about Fourteen Days, Mr. <hi>Ridg,</hi> a choise <hi>English</hi> Minister, came to visit him, and said, I hope, Sir, you do not now Repent that you have been Faithful? He Answered, <hi>I am sorry for nothing but that I was too long before I began</hi> (he meant his Resisting for several Years, a Call to the Ministry, to which he had been much urged,) <hi>and I will tell you a strange thing, which hath much holpen me to be Faithful. These last Seven Years there hath not One Day passed, without thoughts of Death, and renewed Submission to the Will of God therein. Yea, this made me neglect my Body, which should have Served the Lord more, as if it had been Mire in the Street, which now troubles me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Night wherin he Died, sundry Godly Christians were with him, when, for a long time he fell into a deep silence, which ended with Groanings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Intreated. A Christian there present, desired to know what it was that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him; but he refused to tell: But being much urged, he at length said, <hi>I tell you that my Hair stands an end to foresee what is coming upon these Lands:</hi> And being farther pressed, he said, <hi>The Bloody Wars of</hi> Germany <hi>cannot be Ballanced with the Wars of these Three Kingdoms.</hi> What say you Sir? said one of the Company. To
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62667:153"/> whom he Answered, <hi>The Dead Bodies of many Thousands, who now despise the Glorious Gospel, shall lie Unburied as Dung upon the Earth.</hi> What then (said some) shall become of us and our Posterity? He lifted up his Voice and said, <hi>He that is for the Sword to the Sword: He that is for Captivity to Captivity: And he that is for Famine to Famine; for God shall be Avenged upon these Lands.</hi> And when one said, Is there no Remedy? He Cried Thrice, <hi>No Remedy, No Remedy, No Remedy,</hi> and so held his Peace. And a while after he said, <hi>The broken Covenant of</hi> Scotland <hi>must be renewed: The Formality of</hi> Ireland <hi>must be purged: The Prodigality of</hi> England <hi>removed, and the Sons of</hi> Saul <hi>must be hung up before the Sun:</hi> Of which last Words none knew his meaning.</p>
                  <p>Some of his own Parish being present, Asked what he would say to them, to whom he Replied, <hi>Wo to thee</hi> Dunagor, <hi>for the Nettles and the long Grass shall be in greater Plenty in thee, then ever were People to hear the Word of God.</hi> And Three Years together after the late Rebellion, this was fully Accomplished. Some Asked him, if he would have his Children come to him? He Answered, No, He had done with them. And when they mentioned one of his Daughters to him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them to forbear, saying, <hi>She shall see Glorious Days after all this.</hi> Then having taken his Wife by the Hand (who had but Lien-in but Four Days, and now crept out of her Bed to give and take a long Farewel) he said, <hi>Thou hast in Faithfulness suffered many things with me in my Pilgrimage, and now where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>Of Mr. <hi>John Welch.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>John Welch,</hi> a very Holy Man, was not long since Minister of <hi>Kirckcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bright</hi> in <hi>Gatloway</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and afterwards Translated to the Church of <hi>Air,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Rutherfort</hi> in one of his Books, calleth, an Heavenly Prophetical, and Apostolick Man, assuring us, that of each Twenty Four Hours, he spent Eight in Prayer, if other necessary and urgent Duties did not hinder him: Yea, he spent many Days and Nights in Fasting and Prayer for the Afflicted condition of the Church, and for the Sufferings of the Reformed Churches abroad. It was oft his usual manner in the Coldest Winter Nights to Rise for Prayer; and oft-times his Wife (who was an Excellent Woman) hath Risen to seek him, and found him ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Ground Weeping, and Wrestling with the Lord by Prayer: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would be much of the Night in the Church of <hi>Air</hi> upon that account. One time especially she found him over-charged with Sorrow, whereupon he told her, That he had that to press him, which she had not, namely, the Charge of Three Thousand Souls which he must Answer for, whilst he knew not how it was with many of them. And at another time, when she found him alone, his Spirit was overwhelmed with Anguish and Grief, and when she Asked him the Reason of it? He Answered, That the Times that were coming upon <hi>Scotland</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Gospel, would be very Heavy and Sad, but she should not Live to see them.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was a Prisoner in <hi>Blackness</hi> he Wrote thus to a Christian Lady, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those large Joys which he had in his Sufferings for this Truth, That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is a King, and hath a visible Kingdom in the World, even his Church, which is as free to keep its Courts, and to Exert Discipline, by Vertue of an Intrinsick Power from <hi>Christ,</hi> as hath any Kingdom on the Earth: For which he was ready to lay down his Life; yea, that he would be glad and rejoyce to be offered up a Sacrifice for so Glorious a Truth. And in the close of his Letter, he foretold, that Judgment was coming upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> which should be Blood, first by an Intestine Sword, and then by the Sword of a Stranger, and that there should be a great Slaughter, both of Great Men and Mean; which many Lived to see Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who had the Letter among them long before the War began.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:62667:154"/>
                  <p> One <hi>John Steward,</hi> an Eminent Christian that lived at <hi>Air,</hi> coming to visit Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> in Prison, found him in a more then ordinary way troubled and sad, and enquiring of him what was the reason of it? He said, <hi>John,</hi> you should not be here, go home to <hi>Air;</hi> for the Plague of God is broken in upon that place; and cause <hi>Hugh Kennedy,</hi> Provest of that Town (who also was a choise Christian) to Convene the People in the Streets and Pray together, and the Lord shall hear <hi>Hugh Kennedy,</hi> and remove that Stroke. This at first Astonished the said <hi>John,</hi> and made him Question the Truth hereof, having come so lately from thence: But at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he found it so, and accordingly in every thing he found it so as this Man of God had foretold.</p>
                  <p>The King changing the Sentence of Death that was passed upon him at <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> into Banishment, he went over into <hi>France,</hi> where in a short time he Learned the <hi>French</hi> Language, and acquired such a Dexterity therein as was thought strange by them that knew it. <hi>Trochrig,</hi> in his Comment upon the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> sets down this passage concerning him; that being called to Preach at <hi>Salmurz,</hi> before one of the most Learned Auditories in all <hi>France,</hi> he performed it with such Boldness and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as though he had been before a mean Congregation. <hi>Trochrig</hi> being Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at it, and familiarly acquainted with him, Asked him, Whence he had that Confidence, Preaching before such a Judicious Congregation of Strangers, and in a strange Tongue? To which he Answered, In an Humble and Modest manner, as one rather Dejected then Elated, That when he considered his being before the Lord, and that he was delivering his Message, he could not regard the Persons, either of Great or Mean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilst he was Minister at St. <hi>John de Angeli,</hi> a Protestant Town in <hi>France,</hi> where his Ministry was Blessed with great Success, the Civil Wars breaking out, that City was Twice Besieged by the <hi>Popish</hi> Party, during which time these Remarkable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages fell out; The Town being straitly Besieged, and ready to be taken, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies having Raised a Battery, and by their near approach, had made a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Breach in the Wall, Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> being informed hereof (who had much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Citizens by telling them that their Enemies should not prevail against them) he went himself with the Canonier, up to the Walls, and desired him to Charge such a Peice of Canon, and Shoot; for God would direct that Shot, and cause it to prosper, which accordingly was done, and to the Astonishment of the Spectators, it dismounted the Enemies Canon from that Battery, and the Lord was pleased so to order things afterwards, that the King Parlied with the Citizens upon good Tearms, and only himself and Court came into the City, without profering any Violence.</p>
                  <p>Another marvelous passage was this, The <hi>Sabbath</hi> following some of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that place, fearing Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> his danger, did seriously deal with him, that he would not go forth, nor Preach that Day, for that the Court was there: But by no Intreaty would he be hindred from the discharge of his Duty, telling them, That he would adventure to Preach Gods Word to his People, and trust the Lord with what concerned himself (being much grieved at their Fear and Desponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) and had that Day a very great Auditory, both of Friends and others, who came upon the Fame of such a Mans Preaching: But whilst he was in his Sermon, a Great Man of the Court was sent with some of the Kings own Guard, to bring him presently before the King. And whilst he was entring the Church, with some difficulty by reason of the Croud, Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> turning himself towards the Door, desired the People to make way for one of the Great Peers of <hi>France,</hi> who was coming in: And when he was come near unto the Pulpit to Execute his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> with great Authority spake to him before all the People, and in the Name of his Master <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> charged him, that he should not Disturb the Worship of God, wherewith the Noble-man was so affrighted, that he fell a Trembling, yea, was forced to Crouch down, and make no farther Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance.</p>
                  <p>The Sermon being ended, Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> with great Submission, went to the King, who was much Incensed, and with a frowning Countenance, asked, who he was, and how he durst be so Bold as to Preach <hi>Heresie</hi> so near his Person, and carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with such Contumacy? To which, with due Reverence bowing himself, he Answered, I am, Sir, a Servant, and Minister of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> whose Truth I
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62667:154"/> Preached this Day, which if your Majesty did rightly know, you would have come to it your self, and heard it. And for my Doctrine, I did this Day Preach these Truths.</p>
                  <p>First, That Man is fallen, and by Nature is in a lost Condition: Yea, and that by his own Power and Abilities he is not able to help himself.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That there is no Salvation, or Deliverance from Gods Wrath by our own Merits, but by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and his Merit alone.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I Preached this Day the Just Liberties of the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> That your Majesty oweth Obedience to <hi>Christ</hi> only, who is Head of the Church: And that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as he is an Enemy to <hi>Christ</hi> and his Truth, so also to the Kings of the Earth, whom he keepeth under Slavery to his Usurped Power. The King for a time, being silent, and Astonished, turned to some about him, and said, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is a Man of God: Yea, after he Communed with him, and dismissed him with great Respect.</p>
                  <p>The Year following, The Differences continuing betwixt the King and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, that City was again Besieged, taken, and in part Plundered, as Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> did publickly foretel: At which time the King past a solemn Order, That none should in the least wroung Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> or any thing that belonged to him under the highest Penalties, and afterwards gave him a safe Conduct to Transport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into <hi>England,</hi> where he Died: King <hi>James</hi> refusing to give him leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into his own Country, though he was earnestly Petitioned by his Wife to grant that Favour to her Husband for his Health-sake. During his Sickness he was so filled and overcome with the sensible Injoyment of God, that he was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times over-heard in Prayer, to use these words, <hi>Lord hold thy Hand; it is enough: Thy Servant is a Clay Vessel, and can hold no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilst this Mr. <hi>John Welch</hi> was Minister at <hi>Air,</hi> there came two Men with Packs of Cloath to the Towns-end from a Neighbour Town, in a time when a Plague was in some places of the Country, yet the Town whence they came was not at all suspected to be infected. The Sentry at the Bridg stopped them till the Magistrate came, though they had a <hi>Pass,</hi> and though he could not disallow their <hi>Pass,</hi> yet would not the Magistrate suffer them to come in, till he had sent for Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> onely he bad them disburden their Beasts till he had considered what to do. A little after Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> coming, the Magistrate said to him; Sir, here are Men come from such a place; we have heard of no Plague there: Besides, they have a <hi>Pass</hi> from known Men: what would you advise us to do? Mr: <hi>Welch</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered nothing for the present, but uncovering his Head in the midst of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that followed him, and lifting up his Eyes to Heaven (yet without speaking) near half a quarter of an hour, at last he said, <hi>Bayly,</hi> cause these Men to load their Packs and be gone: for if God be in Heaven, the Plague is in these Packs. The Men going away, opened their Packs at <hi>Cumnock,</hi> which so infected the Town, that all the Inhabitants Dyed, not one being left to Bury the Dead.</p>
                  <p>One night, being under an extraordinary pressure of Spirit to go and pour forth his Soul unto God: he left his Wife in Bed, and going out into a Garden, he spent most of the night in Prayer and Praise: But his Wife, missing him so long, at length went to seek him, and not finding him in his ordinary place, she went into other Gardens by such passages as she knew: At last she heard a Voice, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near she heard him speak these words with great fervency, and accompanied with a flood of Tears, <hi>O God! wilt thou not give me</hi> Scotland? <hi>O God wilt thou not give me</hi> Scotland? She being afraid to interrupt him, went home, and heard not the close. At length he came home, and going to Bed, his Wife mildly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him for his unmercifulness to himself: then she asked him what it was that he was saying? For she told him, she heard him: Well said he, you had better have been in your Bed: I tell you I have endured a great fight for <hi>Scotland</hi> this night, and hardly could I prevail that a Remnant should be reserved: Yet God will be gracious.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards he arose another night (as his frequent manner was) but went not out into the Garden, but into another Chamber, where he so laboured and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his Wife hearing him, went several times to draw him to Bed: but he stayed his time, and then returned. His Wife with a modest expostulation, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him for tarrying so long: <hi>Hold thy Peace</hi> (said he) <hi>it will be well with us:</hi>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:62667:155"/>
                     <hi>but I shall never Preach another Sermon in</hi> Air. Then falling asleep, before he awaked, a Messenger came who was sent to carry him Prisoner to <hi>Edenburg</hi> Castle.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was Prisoner there, the Lord <hi>Uchiltry</hi> was Governour of the Castle, whose Sister was Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> his Mother in Law, being <hi>John Knox</hi> his Wife. This Lord being much imployed in King <hi>James</hi> his Court, had not oppertunity to shew his kindness to his Kinsman Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> as he should. But being sensible of his unkindness, he caused Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> to sup with him one night at his own Table, where also were several other Gentlemen, and among them a <hi>Popish</hi> Youth that sat towards the lower end of the Table: and Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> being by the Governour, sate at the upper end, laboured to entertain the Company with Grave and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Discourse, which all attended unto with seriousness, save this young <hi>Papist,</hi> who with laughter and derision sought to silence him, which Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But after Supper, the Guests sitting still, this Youth stood up at the lower end of the Table, and whilst Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> proceeded from grave to gracious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, the Youth grew to that insolency as with his Finger to point at him, and to make wry mouths at him, whereby he so grieved that Holy Man, that on a suddain he was forced to silence.</p>
                  <p>The whole Company, that were much delighted with his Discourses, were silent also▪ But a while after Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> being moved by the Spirit of God: brake forth into these Words: Gentlemen, the Spirit of God is provoked against us, and I shall intreat you not to be afraid to see what God will do amongst you before you rise from the Table: For he will strike some one of you with Death before you go hence. All were silently astonished, waiting with fear to see the issue: And while all Men feared themselves: except this insolent Youth, he fell down Dead among them.</p>
                  <p>One Day as Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> looked out of his Window in the Castle, he saw the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, to whom he said, <hi>God save you, my Lord:</hi> The Governour asked him how he did: and wherein he might serve him? In nothing (said Mr. <hi>Welch)</hi> if you be well, except you would carry a Petition to His Majesty for my Liberty to Preach the Gospel. I willingly will (said the Governour) therefore send it to me, Nay (said Mr. <hi>Welch)</hi> I am your Kinsman, and love you so well as to warn you not to undertake it except you resolve to deal truly in delivering it, and in getting me an Answer. I will bear the blame (said the Governour) if I do it not. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, my Lord, said Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> undertake it not unless you resolve to do it; for the hazard is great; So <hi>Uchiltry</hi> undertook it: But when he came to the King, finding him in a great Passion upon some other occasion, he judged it not meet at that time to present it; and afterwards neglected, and at last, quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got it, for which, his heart smiting him, he durst hardly be seen of Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> for Three Months after. Yet at length, his Conscience forgetting as well as he, he came to the same place where Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> at first called to him. And now Master <hi>Welch</hi> asked him how he did, and what was become of his Petition? The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour being surprized, answered; I delivered it to his Majesty; but he being in a Passion, it seems that it was neglected: for I have not gotten an Answer. Nay my Lord (said <hi>Mr. Welch)</hi> you should not lye to God and me; I know that you delivered it not, and I am sorry my Lord for your Lot: I warned you not to be false to God, and now I tell you, God shall take your Estate, and Honours in <hi>Scotland</hi> from you, and give them to your Neighbour, and this in your own time. This much troubled the Lord <hi>Uchiltry:</hi> And as it was foretold, so it came to pass: For he being the Eldest Son of the good Lord <hi>Uchiltry</hi> (one of the Reformers) was forced in his own time to quit all, and to give both his Estate and Honours to <hi>James,</hi> the Son of Captain <hi>James,</hi> the Second Brother, who was the last of that House.</p>

                  <head>Of Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> was by an extraordinary manner called to the work of the Ministry, having for a long time followed the Study of the Law both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and had some reason to expect a place among the Lords of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62667:155"/> the Session, his Father being a considerable Baron, and one that had many Friends: But a more pressing and irresistable Call from God, did otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of him.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was Minister at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> he shined as a Great Light through the whole Land: The Power and Efficacy of Gods Spirit most sensibly accompanying the Word which he Preached. He was a Terror to Evil-doers, and the Authority of God did so appear upon him, with such a Majesty in his Countenance, as forced Fear and Reverence from the Greatest in the Land; even from those who were the most Avowed Haters of the Power of Godliness. Yea, his Carriage had such an awful Impression upon King <hi>James</hi> himself, that he once before many, gave this Testimony of him, <hi>That</hi> Mr. <hi>Bruce was worthy of half his Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> was a Man that had much inward trouble about his own Spiritual Condition, and had been oft assaulted by Satan to question that Fundamental Truth, whether there was a God: This cost him many Days and Nights wrestling before he could clear it up to his own Soul, which occasioned him, when he came up into the Pulpit, after a short silence (which was his usual way) he would say, <hi>I think it is a great matter to believe that there is a God:</hi> telling the People, that it was not so easie a thing as they judged. It was known unto his Friends with whom he was Familiar, what extraordinary conformation he had hereof from the Lord: what Familiarity he did attain in his secret converses with God.</p>
                  <p>The great success of his Ministry at <hi>Edenburgh, Innerness,</hi> and other Places whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Providence called him, is well known to very many. Whilst he was confined at <hi>Innerness,</hi> that poor dark Country was marvellously enlightned by him, and many were brought home to Christ by his Ministry, and a Seed was sowen in those places which was not wholly worn out for many years after.</p>
                  <p>Famous Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> at his first embrace into the Ministry at <hi>Leuchars,</hi> was very Prelatick, and was, by the B. B. of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> brought in thither against the Parishes consent; So that upon the Day of his Admission, the Church Doors being by the People shut against him, he was fain to break a Window to get en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
                  <p>Not long after Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> hearing of an <hi>Exercise</hi> where Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> was to help, from a longing which he had to see and hear such a Famous Man, he would needs go secretly thither, and placed himself in a dark corner of the Church: where he might not be seen or known. When Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> was come into the Pulpit, for a considerable time he kept silence, as his manner was, which somewhat asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished Mr. <hi>Henderson:</hi> but much more when he heard his first words, which were these: <hi>He that cometh not in by the Door, but climbs up another way, the same is a Thief and a Rohber:</hi> This by Gods Blessing did so affect Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and made so great an Impression upon him, that it was the first means of his Conversion.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> had the Spirit of discerning in a great measure, and did Prophetically foretel many things which did afterwards come to pass: Diverse distracted Persons, and others who were past hope of recovery by the Falling-Sickness, were brought to him, who by the Power and Efficacy of his Prayers, were fully Recovered. He was a great wrestler with God, and had more than ordinary Familiarity with him.</p>
                  <p>A little before his Death, when he was at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and through weakness kept his Chamber, there was a meeting of divers godly Ministers at that time there, upon some special grounds of the Church concernment, who hearing that he was in Town, came to him, and gave him an account of the Actings of those times; Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> went to Prayer, and therein spread before the Lord the substance of their Discourse, which was a sad representation of the State the Church was then in, at which time there was such an extraordinary motion upon all present, and so sensible a powring down of the Spirit, that they could hardly contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Yea, there was an universal motion upon others who were in other parts of the House▪ though they then knew not the cause of it: And Mr. <hi>Weems</hi> of <hi>Lothaker,</hi> being occasionally present, at his going away, said, <hi>how strange a Man is this: for he draws down the Spirit of God upon us all, by knocking his Fingers upon the Tahle,</hi> which indeed he many times did.</p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:62667:156"/>
                  <p> He was deeply affected with the wickedness and profanity of many Ministers then in the Church, and the unsuitable carriage of others in so high a Calling, and did express much fear that the Ministry of <hi>Scotland,</hi> would prove the greatest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of that Church: Learned <hi>Didoclavius</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Altare Doenasce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> gives this Testimony of him: <hi>Robertus Brusius, Vir Genere, &amp; virtute Nobilis, Magistate vultus venerabilis, qui plura animarum millia</hi> Christo <hi>lucrificit, cujus Anima, si villius mortalium (absit verbo invidia) sedet in Coelestibus: Anima mea, cum Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma tua,</hi> Brusi, <hi>si ex aliena Fide esset pendendum.</hi>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Davidson,</hi> Minister of the Gospel at <hi>Salt-Preston,</hi> had an extraordinary Prophetick Spirit, and was Eminently Zealous and Faithful in a time of the Churches defection, whence <hi>Didoclavius</hi> in that aforementioned Preface, tearms him, <hi>Cato, &amp; constans Cato sui temporis:</hi> King <hi>James</hi> pressing the setting up of <hi>Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents</hi> in the <hi>Scottish</hi> Church: Mr. <hi>Davidson</hi> being present in an <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Dundee,</hi> where many were drawn over by the King to consent to it, rose up boldly in the <hi>Assembly,</hi> and in his own Name, and in the Name of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did enter a Protestation against that step of defection, and in yeilding up so far the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Church to please Men.</p>
                  <p>Whilst he was Minister at <hi>Salt-Preston,</hi> the Building of the Church was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by him, which also he much advanced out of his own private Interest: The Lord <hi>Newbattel</hi> (who had great Authority in that Parish) promising to promote it, from which, yet he afterwards drew back, so that the Work ceased; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Davidson</hi> said to him: These Walls that were begun to be Built shall stand as a Witness against you, that ere long God shall root you out, and your Estate out of this Parish, so that you shall not have a piece of Land in the same, which shortly after had a visible accomplishment.</p>
                  <p>In an <hi>Assembly</hi> of the Church Mr. <hi>John Spotswood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Law</hi> had a Process put in against them for some gross misdemeanours, where Mr. <hi>Davidson,</hi> finding a readiness in the <hi>Assembly</hi> to acquit them by reason of their good Parts and Gifts, onely with a reproof, he did with earnestness press their Deposition; But being crossed therein, he said, <hi>you will needs spare these two Men, whereat I am grieved: For the time is coming wherein they will trample upon your Necks,</hi> which prediction had shortly after its accomplishment.</p>
                  <p>He being on a time at Dinner with Mr. <hi>Bruse,</hi> who was then in great Favour with the King, in returning thanks after Meat he had this expression: <hi>Lord, thy Servant hear is a great Favourite at Court, and had in much Respect: But he shall ere long be as much Persecuted as he is now Favoured, and shall go down the Streets when many who now Esteem him greatly, will not vouchsafe to give him a Salutation:</hi> which afterwards came to pass.</p>
                  <p>At another time Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> and he, Dining together at the House of a Magistrate at <hi>Edenburg,</hi> who was then a Cordial Friend to godly Ministers, in his plain and free way, whilst he was giving of thanks, he said, <hi>Lord, this good Man for thy sake hath respect to thy Servants: But he little knows that within a short time he must carry us two, who are present hear to Prison:</hi> which words did much trouble that honest Magistrate, though afterward it came exactly to pass.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman neary related to a great Family in that Parish where Mr. <hi>David<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> was Minister, a violent hater of Piety, did upon that account Beat a poor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man that lived there, having not the least shadow of provocation from him; and among many sore strokes, he gave him one upon the Back, using these words, <hi>Take this for</hi> Mr. <hi>Davidsons sake:</hi> After which, this honest Man, was forced for a time, to keep his Bed, complaining most of the stroke upon his Back. The <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> following, in the close of his Sermon, Mr. <hi>Davidson</hi> speaking about the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Godly, and the Enmity which Wicked Men had to such, did parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly instance in that late Insolence, saying, That it was a sad Time, when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Men would thus openly adventure to vent their Rage against such as were Seekers of God in the place, having no cause of Provocation, saving the Image of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62667:156"/> God in the Person. And then, with great Authority added, <hi>He who hath done this, be he the Laird, or the Lairds Brother, e're a few Days be past, God shall give him such a Stroke, as all the Monarchs in the Earth cannot do,</hi> and the <hi>Saturday</hi> following, as this Gentleman, stood before his Door, he was stricken Dead with a Thunder-bolt, and had all his Bones broken.</p>
                  <p>This Mr. <hi>Davidson,</hi> not long before his Death, occasionally meeting with Mr. <hi>John Ker,</hi> a Young Gentleman who was lately come out of <hi>France,</hi> and had then no thoughts of entring into the Ministry, and was in a very Courtly Dress; Mr. <hi>Davidson</hi> did solemnly charge him to put off his Scarlet Cloak, and to lay aside his Guilded Rapier, and to betake himself to his Book: <hi>For you are the Man</hi> (said he) <hi>who must Succeed me in the Ministry at this place.</hi> This much Astonished the Gentleman for the present, yet did he Obey, and as it was foretold, did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Succeed him; and was a Faithful and Painful Pastor in that place many Years after.</p>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Patrick Simpson</hi> was sometime Minister at <hi>Cramond,</hi> and afterwards Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated to <hi>Sterling.</hi> In his Youth he attained to great Exactness in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and Read many Authors, and being told by some, that they wondered why he spent so much time in Reading <hi>Pagan</hi> Authors? He Answered, <hi>That he purposed to Dedicate all these Jewels which he borrowed from the</hi> Aegyptians, <hi>towards the Building of the House of God.</hi> He did much oppose himself to the Corruptions of the Times: And in the Year 1584, when the King gave an Express Charge. That they should acknowledg Mr. <hi>Patrick Adamson</hi> for Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> or else lose their Maintenance, he with great Vehemency opposed the same, though that Man was his Unkle by the Mothers side: and whereas some were willing to Subscribe, with this Proviso, <hi>According to the Word of God,</hi> He told them, That this could not secure their Consciences, it being <hi>Contradictio in Adjecto,</hi> to Subscribe to any Humane Institution, according to the Word, when the Word did Expresly Condemn the same.</p>
                  <p>He himself refused the offer of a Bishoprick, and afterwards, of a Yearly Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which he looked upon as a Design to Bribe his Conscience, which was more dear to him then all the World. And when the <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the State, he did openly own and avow the same, and in a very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner Denounced the Wrath and Judgment of God against the Accusers and Convictors of those excellent Men at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> who stood for the Liberty of that <hi>Assembly.</hi> And that notable Paper and Protestation which was given in to the Parliament, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1606. was penned by him, and with his own Hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Earl of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> subscribed by many Ministers, who met there upon that account.</p>
                  <p>His Life was most exemplary for Piety, and Faithfulness in the Service of his Master, which Preached no less in that part of the Country where he lived, then did his Doctrine. His Wife, <hi>Martha Barson,</hi> a Gracious Woman, and the Wife of his Youth, with whom he had lived in great Love, fell sick, which proved her last Sickness. In her weakness she was sorely assaulted by Satan, who suggested to her, That she should be given over into his Hands: And it ended in a visible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, which for a time grew upon her: So that, most unlike to her former practice, she would break forth into dreadful and horrid Expressions, and it was most violent on a <hi>Sabbath</hi> Morning, when Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> was going to Preach; whereupon, with an heavy Countenance he stood silent for a time, and at last Kneeled down and Prayed, which she no whit regarded: After which, he, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Company that were present, said, <hi>That he was sure that they who were now Witnesses of that sad Hour, stould yet see a Gracious Change, and that the Devils Malice against that poor Woman should have a shameful Foil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her Distraction still continued until <hi>Tuesday, August</hi> the <hi>Ninth,</hi> which Morning, at the very Dawning of it, he went into his Garden, and shut the Door, where, for many Hours he was alone: But a Godly Woman, one <hi>Helen Garner,</hi> Wise to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62667:157"/> one of the Bayliffs of <hi>Sterling,</hi> who had been with his Wife all Night; apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> might much wrong himself by much Grief and Fasting, by some help, she did climb over into the Garden: But as she came near to the place where Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> was, she was terrified with an extraordinary Noise, which made her fall to the Ground: It seemed to her like a mighty Rushing of Multitudes running together, and withal, she heard such a Melodious Sound, as made her Judg, that it was more then Humane. Whereupon she Prayed to God to pardon her Rashness, which her Affections to that Man of God had carried her to. Yet afterwards, going forwards, she found him lying upon the Ground; she earnestly intreated him to tell her what he had from God? He (till she had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised not to Reveal it so long as he Lived, yet giving her leave to do it, after his Death) said, <hi>O what am I, being but Dust and Ashes, that the Holy Ministring Spirit should be sent by the Lord to deliver a Message to me?</hi> And he told her that he had a Vision of Angels, who did, with an Audible Voice give him an Answer from the Lord, concerning his Wives condition. And returning into his House, he said to all that were present, <hi>Be of good Comfort, for e're Ten Hours be past, I am sure that this Brand shall be pluck'd out of the Fire.</hi> After, he Prayed by his Wives Bed-side, and whilst he was mentioning <hi>Jacobs</hi> wrestling in Prayer, she sat upright in the Bed, and casting by the Curtain, said, <hi>Thou art this Day</hi> Jacob, <hi>who hast wrestled, and also prevailed: And now God hath made good his Words, which he spake this Morning to you: for I am pluck'd out of the hands of Satan, and he shall have no more power over me.</hi> This interruption made him silent for a time, but afterwards, with great melting of heart, he proceeded in Prayer, and magnified the Riches of Gods Love towards her. And from that Hour she spake most Christianly, and comfortably, even to her Death, which was the <hi>Fryday</hi> following, <hi>August</hi> the <hi>13th Anno Christi,</hi> 1601. Her last words were with a Loud Voice, <hi>Come Lord, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> lived several Years after, even till <hi>March,</hi> 1618. At which time he said, <hi>Now shall this Month put an end to all my Labors;</hi> and accordingly, towards the end of it, he was removed by Death; at which time he expressed much Joy: Blessing the Lord for all his kindness towards him, that he had not been perverted by the sinful courses of those Times: and that he might say, That as the Lord had sed <hi>Elijah</hi> in the Wilderness; so in some respect, he had dealt with him all his Life long. Upon some of his Books were these words written, <hi>Remember, O my Soul, and never forget the Ninth of</hi> August, <hi>what Consolation the Lord then gave thee, and how he performed what he spake, according to</hi> Zach. 3. 2. <hi>Is not this a Brand pluck'd out of the Fire?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>ANno Christi,</hi> 1636. Divers choise Ministers and Christians in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> Mr. <hi>Levinston,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>kleland,</hi> were Three of them,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much Persecuted, intended to Transplant themselves into <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not from any fear of their own Sufferings, but that they might have more liberty to Serve the Lord in the Work of the Gospel, when the Door was shut against them in their own Country: At which time there was a strange and remarkable Providence appearing in sundry particulars: As</p>
                  <p>First, The Vessel wherein they went, in the midst of a Tempestuous Sea, and far from any Land, proved like a Riddle, by reason of its many Leaks, the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Ship being also broke off, so that the Pilot and Marriners despaired of safety, not seeing any means of deliverance in an ordinary way: But then God made a poor Seamon, whose company they had shunned, to be an Instrument of saving the Vessel, and all that were in it; for by a marvelous dexterity, he fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Rudder (which others had attempted in vain, and given over all hopes of affecting it) as one Eminently sent by God for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Some of these Eminent Ministers had a strong perswasion of their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and deliverance in the greatest Extremity, which they also declared before the Master and Passengers, whilst they were giving it over as a hopeless Business. Thus seeing an Invincible necessity of returning, though it was very Astonishing and bitter at the first look, yet it afterwards clearly appeared to be from the Lord. And one of the Ministers did express to the rest of his Brethren, That he was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that since the Lord would not accept of their Service in <hi>America,</hi> they should not want Work and Employment in the place whether he was sending them back by so remarkable a Providence, which also within a short time came to pass; so that they could not but say, that the Lord did in a very marvellous and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate way appear in that cross Wind, to make them Instrumental for that great Harvest which afterwards followed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It was also most Observable, That none of those, who upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Consciences, to enjoy the purity of Christs Ordinances, undertook that Voyage, miscarried, whereas Five Persons who went upon another account to enrich themselves, and had unexpectedly slipt into the Ship, all of them, but one, Died upon the Sea. It was also wonderful, that the Lord, as he had stilled the Raging of the Sea, so did he also quiet the Raging of the People, which they found by Experience to their comfort, and the terror of their Adversaries.</p>
                  <p>There was, not many Years since, in <hi>Scotland</hi> a Gentleman, whose Stile was <hi>Wastraw;</hi> a most Bloody Man, and Notorious for Profaneness, who made it his chief Business to stir up Quarrels, and to Engage Men in Blood. Amongst others, he provoked a Neighbouring Gentleman to Kill another in that place, which he did accordingly; but afterwards was much troubled in Conscience for it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this former person told him, That more of that Practice would be the best Cure for him, saying, that himself had Killed Six, and that at the first he was much troubled, but the oftner he did it, it became the more easie. One Day as he was Riding to a place where Two had appointed to decide a private Quarrel by Fighting, his Horse stumbled on the side of a steep Rock, and he fell a great way down, his Sword falling out before him, yet he received no hurt. By this strange Providence God awakened his Conscience, so that stopping his Jorney, he returned home with much Anguish and Remorse, and a strange change followed, whereby he witnessed his Tenderness and Repentance: Before his Death he spent much time alone in Mourning for his Sins: And the Day wherein he Died (though no such thing appeared to them about him) he was heard in his Chamber wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling very much in Prayer: But after long continuance, when he answered not at their Knocking, they broke open the Door upon him, and found him Dead, but upon his Knees in a Praying posture; and all the Blood in his Body swiming about him in the Floor, all the passages of his Body being opened to give it vent. Thus,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62667:158"/> though God giveth Pardon to his People, yet some Sins he will not let pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a visible Token of his Anger, but will take Vengeance of their Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>There was a notorious Thief in the <hi>South</hi> parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> not many Years ago, called <hi>John of the Score,</hi> who for many Years had followed that Wicked Trade. At length he met with a poor Man Traveling with Two Horses, which <hi>Score</hi> took from him: The poor Country-man falling upon his Knees, earnestly Begged, that for <hi>Jesus Christs</hi> sake he would give him the one again; for he had no more to maintain his poor Family with, but what he could get by their Labor: But all was in vain: For the Thief carried both away to his own Home, leaving the poor Man in a very desolate Condition. But not long after, <hi>Score</hi> became very Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and Melancholy, and could get no Rest nor Quiet, and yet knew not the cause, only he professed, that the Words which the poor Man spake, (though he was so great an <hi>Atheist,</hi> that he understood not what he meant when he spake of <hi>Christ,)</hi> did lie like a great weight upon his Spirit: And when he was sought after for his Robberies, he bad his Sons to shift out of the way, but for himself he could not flie, there being a restraint upon him, and something within him that bound him from going out of the way: And so he staid in his House till he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and brought up to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and there put in Prison: whilst he was there, a Godly Minister [Mr. <hi>Henry Blith,]</hi> and a Christian Gentleman <hi>[Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Cunningham,</hi> Tutor of <hi>Boniton]</hi> who had sometimes known him, gave him a Visit, holding forth to him his miserable Estate, and the danger that his Soul was in (for he was Condemned by the Law to Die) and among other Words, they shewed him the necessity of Flying to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> whereupon he suddenly Cried out. <hi>O what word is that! for it hath been my Death: That's the Word that hath lain upon my Heart ever since the poor Man spake it to me, so that from that time I had no power to shift out of the way:</hi> Afterwards, being told what an one <hi>Christ</hi> was, without whom he could not be Saved, he Cried, <hi>Oh, will he ever look to me? and shew me Mercy, who for his sake would not sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w Mercy to that poor Man, and give him back his Horse?</hi> Yet after further Instruction, a real and gracious Change did appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and he gave most convincing Evidences of the reality thereof: Yea, he attained to great Assurance before his Death, and upon the Scaffold, in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Street, where he was Executed, spake so wonderfully of the Lords dealing with him, and that with such Knowledg and Judgment, as left a Conviction upon all present, that he had the Grace of God in reality.</p>
                  <p>There was one <hi>Patrick Mackelwroth</hi> in the <hi>West</hi> part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had his Heart touched in a most remarkable way, by the Lord, and after his Conversion, (as he told many of his Christian Friends) he was so affected with the new World, into which he was entred, together with the discoveries of God, and of a Life to come, that for some Months together, he could scarce ever sleep, but was continually taken up in Admiration. His Life was very remarkable, for Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and near Converse with God, in his Daily walk. One Day after a sharp Tryal (having his only Son suddenly taken away by Death) he retired into private for several Hours; and when he came forth, he looked so chearfully, that to those who asked him the reason of it, and wondred at it in such a time; he told them, That he had got that in his retirement with the Lord, that to have it again renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he would be content to lose a Son every Day.</p>
                  <p>It had been long his Burden, that he had such a bad Memory, so that he could retain almost nothing of what he heard: And bitterly complaining thereof to a worthy Minister, [Mr. <hi>James English]</hi> of <hi>Dally,</hi> he advised him, That when he heard any Truth which he desired to remember, he should commend it to the Lord, and intreat him to keep it for him, and to give it to him back again when he should stand in most need of it: Which accordingly this Holy Man did put in practice most seriously, and when he came to lie on his Death-Bed, to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and divers other Christians that were present, he did solemnly declare, how wonderfully the Lord had Answered his Prayers: For whereas want of Memory had been his great Burden, now the Lord had given him back all those Truths that he had put into his Keeping, so that what he had heard many Years before, was now most clearly brought into his Remembrance, which he shewed by repeating many particular Truths, and Notes of Sermons, which at such and such times he had heard.</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:62667:158"/>
                  <p> All these <hi>Scotish Stories</hi> are related by a Godly old <hi>Scotish</hi> Minister, who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that he hath written nothing but what he hath either upon his own knowledg, or else from the Testimony of such Faithful Witnesses, as that he had no reason to question the Truth of them.</p>
                  <p>Not many Years since, in the Town of <hi>Air</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there was a poor Man Committed to Prison for the filthy Sin of Buggery. And before his Imprisonment, he was in the Judgment of all that knew him, a most stupid Brutish Person, far from God, and from the knowledg of him: But whilst he was in Prison the Lord did marvelous declare the power of his Grace, and in such a measure discovered to him his great Wickedness, that after many conflicts in his Soul, and great wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Prayer, a most kindly work of Repentance did appear in him, which was accompanied with great Assurance, insomuch; as when he came to the Stake, he could not cease from Crying out to the People, under the sense of Pardon, and that comforting Sunshine of Gods presence and favour, <hi>Oh! he is a great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver: He is a great Forgiver.</hi> Adding these words, <hi>Now hath perfect Love cast out all Fear: For</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>hath paid all: I know that the Lord hath nothing to lay to my Charge; for</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>hath paid all; and such are free indeed, whom the Son makes free:</hi> And thus Died in a Ravishment of Joy and Wonder.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> in his Younger Years, having his Heart touched by the word, being at <hi>Paris,</hi> went to the Protestant Church at <hi>Charenton,</hi> where he heard the <hi>Ninety First Psalm</hi> Read and Expounded, and God followed it with so much power, that he not only found it marvelous sweet for the present, but was sttengthened to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: Yea, had wrought in him a strong perswasion, that the Lord would make good to him all those Promises contained in it: which afterwards he found verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as with much comfort he Testified at his Death, saying, That a sat that time he had been holpen to close with that great Truth, <hi>Verse</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> of taking <hi>the Lord for his God,</hi> and got a sure claim thereto: Yea, that he would be his <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>Fortress,</hi> he had found it performed remarkably in the course of his Life. That he had been delivered from the <hi>Snare of the Fowler,</hi> and from the <hi>Noisome Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence,</hi> having in frequent hazards been delivered from many that did lie in wait for him: And sometime he was in great danger of the Pestilence, which was in those places where he was called to reside. Yea, in the time of the Civil Wars which were then hot in <hi>France,</hi> he had convincing Deliverances from many Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dangers, at such times as he was called by the Protestant Princes into the Field, where Thousands did fall on his Right and Left hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And upon his death Bed he did, with much comfort, declare in all the perticulars the Accomplishment of those Promises to him: Adding that he had found that God had <hi>given his Angils charge over him,</hi> and had often <hi>heard when he called upon him,</hi> and had been with him in <hi>trouble, and delivered him,</hi> yea, had <hi>satisfied him with a long life:</hi> And now (said he) I have no more to wait for, but the fulfilling of that last Promise in the <hi>Psalm, I will shew him my Salvation. Idem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Laird of <hi>Raith</hi> of a known and Ancient Family in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reformation of Religion in the Kingdom, was a Profess't <hi>Papist.</hi> But the Lord directed that great Servant of his Mr. <hi>Wiseheart,</hi> to come one Night late to his House, who, after some Repulses by a Servant, got access to this Gentleman, and told him, that he was come to offer the Gospel of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to him and his Family if he pleased to receive it. This was spoken with such Authority and Power upon the Gentlemans Conscience that he most kindly received him, and told him that he was <hi>Welcome.</hi> And it pleased God that a little after, this Visit was made so Succesful, upon Mr. <hi>Wisehearts</hi> Instructing him and his Family in the Truth, that they made a Publick Profession of the same, and the Gentleman Evidenced the Truth of his Conversion.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, by that Subtilty and Malice of <hi>Cardinal Beaton,</hi> this Laird of <hi>Raith</hi> was seized upon in the Laird of <hi>Grange</hi> his House, and carried Prisoner to the Castle of <hi>Edenburg,</hi> and so hotly pursued by that Wretched <hi>Cardinal</hi> (who was then in his greatest Power) that within a short time he was Condemned to Dye. His Lady being overwhelmed with grief upon her Husbands Sufferings, and the Forfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Estate, (having five Sons and some Daughters to provide for) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to draw him to a Recantation. But as one that was much with God, he told her that that God, for whom he Suffered (he was assured) would provide for his
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62667:159"/> Family, and Posterity; &amp; that she should yet live to see her youngest Son to be in a better Condition than himself had ever been, in which also came to pass. His second Son went into <hi>France,</hi> &amp; was there raised to great Honour, &amp; upon his return Home, purchased a considerable Estate, and was made Lord <hi>Melvin,</hi> and he bought also part of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> Estate. His third Son was Lord <hi>Tongland,</hi> and one of the Judges of the <hi>Sessions,</hi> and another of them was Laird of <hi>Halhill.</hi> And which was most strange, the <hi>French King</hi> (moved by the great respect he had for that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman Sir <hi>Robert Melvin</hi> the second Son formerly mentioned) did upon a Treaty with <hi>Scotland,</hi> move &amp; procure the taking off the Forfiture of that Estate of <hi>Raith,</hi> whereby the Eldest Son was restored to his Inheritance. And its known to this Day, how graciously the Lord hath witnessed his respect to that Family, which is now enjoyed by the Lord <hi>Melvin,</hi> who, by a continued Succession is descended from that worthy Gentleman who so suffered for the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the Sun of the glorious Gospel of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> began to spread its Rays in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> there was one <hi>James Faber,</hi> a Native of a Steeple in <hi>Picardy,</hi> a most Faithful and Eminent Minister of the Gospel there, who, in a time of Persecution, was forced (with others) to retire for Security to the Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> who was at <hi>Albert</hi> in <hi>Gascoin,</hi> who had him in high esteem. On a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Day the Queen gave him notice that she meant to come and dine with him, and for that end invited some learned Men, whose conference she took much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in. At Dinner Mr. <hi>Faber</hi> became exceeding sad, and now and then brake out into bitter weeping, of which the Queen complained, and required of him the cause why he wept when she came to be merry with him? To which he answered, <hi>Most Serene Queen, how can I be glad, or make others glad, who am as wicked a man as the Earth bears?</hi> And what is that wickedness (said she) you complain of, who are known from your Youth to have lived so holily? He Answered; <hi>I am now an hundred years old, free from the touch of any Woman, and remember not that have committed any thing that should be a burden to my Conscience, or that should make me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to leave the World, except one Sin, for which yet I am assured that there is a Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi> And as she pressed him to declare what it was? He could scarse speak for abundance of Tears, and said, <hi>How can I appear before the Throne of God, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taught others in Purity, and Sincerity, the Holy Gospel of the Son of God, many of which, having followed my Doctrine, have constantly suffered a Thousand Torments, and Death it self, whereas I in the mean time, like an unconstant Doctor did fly, and tho I had lived long enough, and should not have feared Death, but rather desired it, yet did withdraw my self, and thus cowardly transgressed the Command of my God.</hi> Hereupon the Queen (as she was most Eloquent) did by Reason and Examples shew him that this had befaln divers of the holy Servants of God. Others there present also did add such considerations as made him more cheerful. And thereupon he said, <hi>there remains now nothing but that I go to my God, and having made my</hi> Will, <hi>I have an Impression that I must delay no longer, knowing that the Lord calls for me.</hi> Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fixed his Eyes upon the Queen, he said, <hi>Madam, I make you my Heir, and to your Preacher</hi> Mounsieur Gerard <hi>I leave my Books: And to the Poor I give my Cloaths, and what else I have.</hi> The Queen, smiling said, what then Mr. <hi>Faber,</hi> shall I have? <hi>The Care, Madam</hi> (said he) <hi>to see this Distributed to the Poor.</hi> It is well (said she) and I solemnly Prosess, that this Legacy is more acceptable unto me, than if the King my Brother had named me his Heir.</p>
                  <p>After this he was more Joyful, and at last, he said, <hi>I have need of some rest: be you merry and joyful, and in the mean time adue.</hi> Having thus spoken, he laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self down upon a Bed that was near; where (as they judged) he lay sleeping, but was indeed <hi>faln a sleep in the Lord,</hi> without the least sign of any previous indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and when they were about to awake him, to their great admiration, found him dead This Narrative the Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> did relate her self to <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second, Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> when he lay sick at <hi>Paris,</hi> and it was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by a worthy Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Hubertus Thomas,</hi> a Counsellor to the said <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> who was present at this Relation of the Queens, from whom Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> had it, who hath set it down in an Epistle to his Brother.</p>
                  <p>There was a Famous Christian in <hi>Scotland</hi> called <hi>John Stewart,</hi> Provist of <hi>Aire,</hi> who from his very younger Years was much inclined to Piety. He had a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Estate left him by his Father: But considering the great straits and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous

He said, he <hi>knew</hi> the straits that many of them were in to hold up their Credit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had brought a little mony to lend to each of them; yet so, as that they should never offer to repay it, till he required the same.</p>
                  <p>Some time after he had distributed this Mony, the Plague having been much in <hi>Air,</hi> and they by Trade decaying, himself fell under some straits, and some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Persons in the place began to make it their sport, saying, that Religion had made him poor, and his giving much to others, like a Fool, made him now w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But after long waiting, he was informed for certain, that his Ship was taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi> which became a matter of great grief to him; not because he <hi>knew</hi> not <hi>how to be abased,</hi> as well as <hi>how to abound:</hi> But, fearing that the Mouths of wicked Men would now much more be opened, to reproach the Profession of Religion, which made him, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days keep to his Chamber. At length a Maid that had heard among the People that <hi>John Stewards</hi> Ship was Arrived in the Road, came running in, and cryed at the Door, that his Ship was come. But he, being at Prayer, would not stir till he had done serving his Master, and then went forth, and saw that it was a Truth. But as a further occasion of Exercise to him, there was a worthy Christian, and an Intimate of this <hi>[John Kennedy,]</hi> who for Joy, had gon forth in a small Boat to the Ship; but a suddain Storm arising, he was carried beyond the Ship, and in the Judgment of all that looked on, he and the Boat were devoured by the Seas: Yea, the Storm encreased to such an height, that they feared the loss of the Ship also, which did so deeply affect this gracious Man, that, retiring into his Chamber, he would be seen by none for three days. But at last, coming forth, he went to visit the Widdow (as he supposed) of his dear Friend: But whilst in that Family they were mutually witnessing their Grief, <hi>John Kennedy</hi> came in among them, who had not been cast away (as was supposed) but by a strange Providence had been driven far away to another part of the Coast. Hear many Mercies met at once: He vended his Commodities in the Ship, with which he payed all his Debts, and had Twenty Thousand Marks over to himself: Thus that <hi>Bread that was cast upon the Waters, after many Days</hi> was restored again: <hi>and by liberal devices the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man doth stand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>John Stewart</hi> when he came to dye, his Friends standing about him, he oft exhorted them to be humble: And concerning himself he said, It may be some of you doubt nothing of my good Estate now I am going the way of all Flesh: Yea, and I testify, that except when I slept, or was upon business, I was not these Ten Years without thoughts of God, so long as I could go from mine own House to the Cross, and yet I much doubt of my self, and am in a great Agony, and near the brink of Despair. But a day or two before his Death, he turned his Face to the Wall for the space of about two hours, and then Mr. <hi>Fergusson,</hi> a grave and godly Minister of that place, coming in, asked him what he was doing Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he turned himself, and said, <hi>I have been fighting, and working out my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear, and trembling▪ And now (I bless God) it is perfected, sealed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and now all fears are gone:</hi> and so he dyed comfortably.</p>
                  <p>In the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> there was a Godly and Gracious Gentlewoman, where the Rebellion brake out there, <hi>Anno, Christi.</hi> 1641. who, with some other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and her three Children, whereof, one was sucking on the Breast, fled, They had not gon far where by the <hi>Irish</hi> they were stripped stark naked, yet (to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) they spared their Lives; Probably thinking that Hunger and Cold would soon kill them. Afterwards, going on at the Foot of a River that runs into the <hi>Lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>each,</hi> another Company of <hi>Irish</hi> met them, and would have them cast into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:62667:161"/> This Godly Woman, nothing dismaied, asked only a little forbearance whilst she prayed. And as she lay naked upon the Frozen Ground, she resolved not to go her self to such an un-just Death. They called her and she refusing to come, They dragged her by the Heels along that rugged way to the River, to be cast in with the rest of her Company. But she turning on her Knees said, you should (I am sure) be Christians, and men I see you are. In taking away our miserable Lives, you will do us a Pleasure. But know as we never wronged you nor yours. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that you must dye also your selves, and give an account of this Cruelty to the great Judg of Heaven and Earth. Hereupon an <hi>Irish Priest,</hi> then present, said, Let us not take away their Lives, but we will put them into the <hi>Iland</hi> in this Lake, and a Boat being in the River, they put all these Eight naked Persons, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all Food into it, and carring them into the <hi>Iland,</hi> left them there. After four days of their being there, some of the Company dyed of Hunger and Cold; but neither this Woman nor any of her Children; For she lived by Faith upon the Word of God, and not by <hi>Bread only.</hi> The day after two of her boys crept a side and found the Hide of a Beast at the Root of a Great Tree, which the Mother and they Endeavoured to cast over them, there lying upon the Snow. The next day a little Boat passed by, whom she requested, for Gods Sake to carry them out of that desolate Place; But they being <hi>Irish</hi> would not. Then she begged a little Bread of them, They said they had none there (seeing Fire in the Boat) she begged a cole of Fire of them, which they gave her. And so with some small Chips, they made a Fire, and the Boyes, taking a peice of the Hide, laid it upon the Coals, and began to knaw the Leather. But this, without an extraordinary support, could do them little good.</p>
                  <p>Then they continued ten Days without any visible means of Delivery, and this good Woman professed that it was by Faith and Joy in God, that she so lived. Nor had they any Food but Ice and Snow, nor Drink but Water; yet she thought that God put more nourishment into them than ordinary, for she found them Clammy. Gods Providence so ordered it, that the next day a Boat carried them out to the side of the <hi>Band-Water,</hi> where yet they had Perished, but that she could not endure to see her Children dye in her sight: and tho her two Boyes were young, and so star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they were scarce able to go, yet she pressed them to go out of her sight, under a pretence of seeking some fire, and she bad them to hold their Faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards such a place, where (in that desolate Country) she knew they could have no Fire, yet, in such an Extremity, leaving room for God to work their safety, the poor Children had not crawled far before they saw two or three great dogs prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Man that had been slain. At the sight of them the Children were much affraid (who needed not to fear any thing, but living in such a Condition.) One of these Dogs came running and leaping upon one of the Children without doing him the least hurt, only fawned on him, and would run a little before him, and then tarry till the Children came up, and so by degrees he led them to an House where Smoke appeared, which was an <hi>Irish</hi> Mans who was protected by the <hi>English</hi> of <hi>Antrum,</hi> by which meanes they were marvellously preserved; and the Mother was sent for, and sucored by a party from <hi>Antrum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Husband of this Gentlewoman, was a sweat-humoured Gentleman and godly, and one who was used to frequent that famous <hi>Fridays-Meeting</hi> at <hi>Antrum</hi> before the Rebellion brake forth: But being ensnared by some <hi>Arminians</hi> that liv'd in those Parts, the worthy Ministers thereabout, after much pains taken with him, could not reclaim him; whereupon Reverend M. <hi>Blair</hi> said to another godly Minister, <hi>I am of opinion that this Gentleman shall either turn Patient, or Madder many Days:</hi> which was soon aftrr accomplished, for he fell so furiously mad, that they were forced to keep him bound; and thus he continued for a Year, only with some <hi>lucida intervalla.</hi> At the end of the Year, being very furious, the Devil taught him (yet by an over-ruling Providence of God) to feign himself sober: and then he intreated his Wife to free him from his Bonds, which she did accordingly: But rising at Breek-a-day, and wrapping himself in the Coverlet, he went to a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with a Resolution to drown himself: Yet when he was at the very Brink, he had this suggested to him: what a Fool am I to drown the Coverlet, which may be useful to some Body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he went back a little, and laid it down at the Root of a Tree, and then was fully purposed to throw himself into the River. But at the very Brink, this also was suggested: were it not best to pray before I dye. Hereupon, turning a little aside, he fell down to prayer, and ere he had done, his Reason and Understanding were Restored to him, with Peace of Conscience, and assurance of Pardon in as large a measure as ever in his Life he enjoyed it before, to the great Joy and Comfort of his Wife and Friends.</p>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Sir</hi> Philip Sidney, <hi>who Died</hi> An. Ch. 1586.</head>
               <p>SIR <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> was the first born Son of Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> who was a Man of an excellent wit, large Heart and conversation; and such a Governour, as sought not to make an end of the State in himself, but to plant his own ends in the prosperity of his Country; witness his sound Establishments both in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> where his memory is deservedly grateful unto this Day.</p>
               <p>His Mother was Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and Sister to the Earls <note place="margin">His Parentage.</note>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:62667:162"/> of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Licester:</hi> She was by nature of a large ingenious Spirit, whence, as it were, even racked with native strength, she chose rather to hide Her self from the curious eyes of a delicate time, than to come upon the stage of the World with any manner of disparagement: The mischance of sickness having cast such a kind of veile over her excellent Beauty, as the modesty of that Sex doth many times upon their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and Heroical Spirits. By this it appears that his Descent was apparently Noble on both sides. Yea, and it may probably be gathered, that this clearness of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Judgment, and the ingeniousness of his Mothers, brought so happy a temper in this well mixt Off-spring of theirs; who as he was their first born, so was he not the contraction, but the extension of their strength, and the very aim, and perfect Type of it.</p>
               <p>A Noble Man of Eminent Parts, that was brought up with him from his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, gives this Testimony of him: <hi>I</hi> (saith he) <hi>tho I knew him from a Child, yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew him other than a Man: With such a staidness of mind, lovely, and familiar gravity, as carried grace and reverence above greater years. His talk was profitable, and his very play tended to the enriching of his mind: So that even his Teachers found something in him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and learn, above that which they had usually read, or taught: Which Eminence, by Nature and Industry, made his worthy Father stile him,</hi> Lumen Familiae: <hi>The Light of his Family.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Instance that Reverend <hi>Languet,</hi> mentioned for honour sake in Sir <hi>Philip Sid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y</hi>'s <note place="margin">His Travails.</note>
                  <hi>Arcadia,</hi> learned <hi>usque ad-miraculum,</hi> Learned, even to a miracle; who wisely forseeing dangers at home from <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> went abroad, and setled at <hi>Frankford,</hi> where he was intertained Agent for the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and an under-hand Minister for his own King. He lodged in <hi>Wechels</hi> house, the Printer of <hi>Frankford,</hi> where Sir <hi>Philip</hi> in his Travels, chanced also to become a Guest. This ingenious old mans fulness of knowledge, travelling as much to be delivered of abundance by teaching, as Sir <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> rich Nature and industry, thirsted to be taught, and manured by him. This Harmony of an humble Hearer, and an excellent Teacher, so equally pleased them both, as out of a natural descent both in Love and plenty, the Elder grew taken with a Net of his own thread, and the Younger was taught to lift up himself by a Thread of the same spinning: So as this Reverend <hi>Languet,</hi> became a Nurse of Knowledge to this Hopeful young Gentleman, and without any other hire or motive than this <hi>Sympathy</hi> of affections, accompanied him in the whole course of his three years Travels.</p>
               <p>And when the diversity of years, and courses of Life enforced these dear Friends to part asunder, there yet passed such a continual course of intelligence by Letters from one of them to the other, as in their loss there be buried many delicate images, and differences, between the real and large complexions of those Active times, and the narrow <hi>Salves</hi> of this effeminate age: Because in this excellent mould of their friendship, the greatest businesses of Estate were so mixed with the sweet Remissions of ingenuous good Will, as men might easily discern in them (as in unflattering Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) that Wisdom and Love, in good Spirits have great affinity together. For a farther demonstration whereof, this same Reverend <hi>Languet</hi> (after he was sixty six years of age) framed to himself a journey into <hi>England,</hi> in the Company of Duke <hi>Casimire,</hi> only to see that excellent Plant of his own pruning, and polishing: By which loving, and unexpected meeting, neither of them became losers. At the Sea-side they parted, and made many mutual Tears ominous Prophecies of their never meeting again.</p>
               <p>That worthy Prince, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nassau,</hi> had long kept intelligence with Sir <hi>Philip</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fame had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Sidney,</hi> both by word and Letters, and that in affairs of the highest nature which then passed currant upon the Stages of <hi>England, France, Germany, Italy,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> And this young Gentleman had, by his mutual freedom, so imprinted the extraordinary merit of his young years, into the large wisdom, and experience of that excellent Prince, that, as Sir <hi>Fulk Grevil</hi> (Sir <hi>Philips</hi> intimate Friend) passed out of <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> meeting with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in the Town of <hi>Delph,</hi> among other discourse, he spake of the dangerous fate, which the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> States of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> did stand threatned with, under an ambitious, and Conquering Monarchs hand, meaning <hi>Philip</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having instanced in other Countries, he became to speak of <hi>England,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62667:162"/> other passages, he protested, that if he could judge, her Majesty of <hi>England</hi> (Queen <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> had one of the ripest and greatest Counsellours of Estate in Sir <hi>Phillip Sidney,</hi> of all that then lived in <hi>Europe;</hi> to the tryal of which he would leave his own credit engaged, untill Her Majesty might be pleased to employ this Gentleman, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among Her Friends, or against her Enemies.</p>
               <p>His Uncle, the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> (after Sir <hi>Philip</hi>'s death, and not long before his own) told a great Courtier, that when he undertook the Government of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> he carried his Nephew Sir <hi>Philip</hi> over with him, as one among the rest, not only despising his youth as a Counsellor; but withal bearing an hand over him as a forward young man: Yet notwithstanding, in a short time he saw this Sun so risen above his <hi>Horizon,</hi> that both he, and all his Stars were glad to fetch light from him; and in the end, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <note place="margin">His Prudence and Conduct:</note> that he held up the honour of his casual Government, and Authority by him, whilst he lived, and found reason to withdraw himself from it, after his death.</p>
               <p>Also, Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> his Father-in-law, that wise and active <hi>Secretary of State</hi> who (as the world knew) upheld Religion and Estate, by using a Policy, wisely mixed with reflections of either: For he had influence in all Countries, and an hand upon all Affairs; yet even this Man hath confessed to some great Personages, that his <hi>Philip</hi> did so far overshoot him in his own Bow, as those Persons, which at first were friends to Sir <hi>Philip</hi> for the Secretaries sake, within a while became so fully owned, and possesst by Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> as now he held them at the second hand, by his Son-in-law's native cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie.</p>
               <p>He wan great respect and honor among the most eminent Monarchs of the time. As first with his most excellent Majesty, King <hi>James,</hi> then King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whom his service was affectionately devoted, and from whom he received many pledges of love and favour.</p>
               <p>As likewise with the Renowned King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> and then of <hi>Navar,</hi> who having measured, and mastered all the Spirits in his own Nation, found out this Master-spirit among us, and used him as an equal in Nature, and so fit for Friendship with a King.</p>
               <p>Also the gallant Prince <hi>Don John de Austria,</hi> Vice-Roy in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> when this Gentleman, in his Ambassage to the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> came to kiss his hand, tho at first, in his Spanish haughter, he gave him access, as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent to a youth, of Grace, as to a stranger, and in particular competition (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) to an enemy; yet after a while, when he had taken his just <hi>altitude,</hi> he found himself so stricken with this extroardinary <hi>Planet,</hi> that the Beholders wondred to see what ingenious tribute, that Brave, and high-minded Prince paid to his worth; giving more honor and respect to this hopefull young Gentleman, than to the Ambassadors of might Princes.</p>
               <p>Again, In what due estimation his extroardinary worth was, even among enemies, will appear by his death. For when <hi>Mendoza,</hi> a Secretary of many Treasons against us, heard of it, he said openly, <hi>That howsoever he was glad King</hi> Philip, <hi>his Master, had lost in a private Gentleman a dangerous enemy to his Estate; yet he could not but lament to see Christendom deprived of so rare</hi> a <hi>light, in those cloudy times, and bewail poor Widow</hi> England (so he tearmed it) <hi>that having been many years in breeding one eminent Spirit, was in a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bereaved of him, by the hands of a Villain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed he was a true Model of worth: A man fit for great undertakings: For Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, <note place="margin">His rare Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> Plantations, Reformation of things amiss, and what Action soever is greatest and hardest among men; and withal, such a lover of Mankind, and goodness, that whosoever had any real parts, found comfort in him; yea, participation, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the uttermost of his power. The Universities abroad and at home, accounted him a general <hi>Maecenas</hi> of Learning, and learned Men: Dedicated their Books to him, and Communicated every Invention, or improvement of Knowledge with him. The Soldiers honoured him, and were so honored by him, as no man thought he marched under the true banner of <hi>Mars,</hi> that had not obtained Sir <hi>Philip Sydney's</hi> approbation.</p>
               <p>Men of Affairs in most parts of Christendom, entertained correspondence with him. But what should these be spoken of and mentioned, with whom his own ways, and ends did concur? Since his heart, and capacity were so large, that there was not a cunning <hi>Painter,</hi> skilful <hi>Engenier,</hi> an excellent <hi>Musician,</hi> or any other Artificer of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troardinary Fame, that made not himself known to this famous Spirit, and found him his

               <p>Yea, it will be confessed by all that knew him, that this one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

His Heart and Tongue went both one way, and so with every one that went with the Truth, as knowing no other Kindred, party, or end.</p>
               <p>Above all, he made the Religion which he professed, the firm <hi>Basis</hi> of his Life: <note place="margin">His Piety.</note> For his Judgment was, that our true-heartedness to the Reformed Religion in the beginning, brought peace, safety, and freedom to us; concluding, That the wisest and best way, was that of the famous <hi>William,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who never divided the consideration of Estate from the cause Religion, nor gave the sound party cause to be jealous or distracted, upon any apparance of safety whatsoever; Prudently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, that to temporize with the enemies of our Faith, was but (as among <hi>Seaguls)</hi> a strife not to keep upright, but aloft upon the top of every Billow: Which false-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness to God and Man, would in the end find it self forsaken of both, as Sir <hi>Philip</hi> conceived. For to this active Spirit, all depths proved but shallow Fords, he pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing into mens Counsels and Ends, not by their words, Complements, or Oaths, all barren in that Age, but by fathoming their hearts, and powers by their Deeds, and found no wisdom, where he found no courage, nor courage without wisdom, nor either of them without honesty and Truth. The Ingenuity of his nature did spread it self freely abroad: None that then lived when he dyed, could say, that he ever did them wrong, or harm, but many there were that thankfully acknowledged that he had done them good. Neither was this in him a private, but a publick affection; his chief ends being, not Friends, Wife, Children or himself: But above all things, the honour of his Maker, and Saviour, and the service of his Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> shewed his rare wisdom and ripe parts, in his youth and first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">His Policy.</note> when he was sent by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory, to condole the Death, and to congratulate the succession of <hi>Rodolph</hi> to the Empire. For under the shadow of this Complement between Princes, which sorted better with his youth than his Spirit, did he not, to improve that Journey, and make it a real service to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, porcure an <hi>Article</hi> to be added to his <hi>Instructions,</hi> which (as he passed) gave him scope, to salute the <hi>German</hi> Princes, who were interessed in the cause of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or their own native Liberty?</p>
               <p>And tho, to Negotiate with that long-breathed Nation, proves commonly a work in steel, where many blows hardly leave any print: Yet did this Master-workman quickly stir up their cautions, and slow Judgments to be sensible of the danger which threatened them hourly, by this fattal conjunction of <hi>Romes</hi> undermining superstitions, with the Commanding forces of <hi>Spain.</hi> And when he had once awakened that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Nation to open their eyes, and to look up, he as easily made manifest unto them, that neither their Inland seat, vast multitude, confused strength, wealth, nor hollow-sounding-fame, could secure their Dominions from the ambition of this brave as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring Empire; Howsoever, by the like helps, there had formerly bounded the same <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Austrian</hi> Supremicies.</p>
               <p>He recalled to their Memories, how by this Brother-hood in evil (like <hi>Simion</hi> and <hi>Levi) Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> had shed so much blood, as that they were justly become a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to all Governments, and could now be withstood, or ballanced by no other means than by a General League in Religion; constantly, and truly affirming, that to associate by a uniform bond of Conscience, for the protection of Religion and liberty, would prove a more solemn union, and <hi>Symbolize</hi> far better, against their Tyrannies, than any factious combination in policy, League of state, or other Traffick of Civil, or Martial humours, could possibly do.</p>
               <p>The next doubtful Stage which he had to act upon, was grounded upon a publick, <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> and specious Proposition of Marriage between our famous Queen, and the Duke of <hi>Anjou:</hi> About which match, altho he saw the great, and wise Men of those times, suddenly carried down, and every one fishing to catch the Queens humor in it; Yet when he considered their difference in years, Person, Education, State, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62667:164"/> between them; And then called to mind the success of our former Alliances with the <hi>French,</hi> he found many reasons to make question whether it would not prove <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> on their part: And if real, whether the Ballance swaied not unequally, by adding much to them and little to his Soveraign? The Dukes greatness being only in Name and possibility, and both these would either wither, or must be maintained at her cost. Her Estate was also in hand, and tho Royally sufficient to satisfie that Queens Princely, and moderate desires, or expences, yet perchance, inferior to bear out those mixt designs, into which his Ambition, or necessities might entise, or draw her.</p>
               <p>Again, Sir <hi>Philip</hi> considering the inconveniences, and mischiefs which came by Queen <hi>Maries</hi> matching with King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> tho he confessed that our Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>French</hi> to be less unequal; yet even in that he foresaw, that diversity in Religion would first give scandal unto both, and in progress, prove of necessity, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to one side: Because the weaker party here, being fortified by strong parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and an Husbands name at home, must necessarily have brought the native Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aign under a kind of <hi>Covert Baron,</hi> and thereby have forced her Majesty, either to lose the freedome and Conscience of a good Christian, the Honour of an excellent Princess, or the private reputation of an obedient Wife. Neither could that excellent Lady (as he conceived) with these, or any other cautions, have countermined the Mines of practice, whereby (it is probable) this Prince would have endeavoured, to steal the change of Religion into this her Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As First, by cavelling at the Authors, and Fathers that upheld her Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then by desgracing her most Zealous <hi>Ministers,</hi> through aspersions cast upon their Persons, and advanceing indifferent Spirits, whose God is this world, the Court their Heaven, and consequently their ends, to byass Gods immortal Truth to the fancies of mortal Princes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the subtile latitude of School-distinctions, publickly edging nearer the Holy <hi>Mother Church of Rome;</hi> and therein, first waving, the sounding the Peoples minds; If not with abrupt, and Spirit-fallen <hi>Toleration,</hi> yet with that invisible Web of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivancy,</hi> which is a snare to intangle great, or lesser Flies at the Will of Power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By a Princely licentiousness in behaviour and Conscience, fashioning <hi>Atheism</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong her Subjects: As knowing that in Confussion of thoughts, he might the more easily raise up Superstitious Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By a publick decrying of our ancient Customes and Statutes; and from that ground, giving Proclamations a Royal vigor in moulding of Pleas, Pulpits, and Parliaments, after the <hi>French</hi> mode, which in our Government is a confusion almost as fatal as the Confusion of Tongues.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By imploying no instruments among the People, but such as devise to sheer them with Taxes, to ransome them with Fines, to draw in Bondage under colour of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, so to bring the <hi>English</hi> People to the poverty of the <hi>French</hi> Peasants.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To lift up Monarchy above her ancient Legal Circles, by banishing all free Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, till the <hi>Ideas</hi> of native Freedom should be utterly forgotten.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Also in the practice of this Marriage, he foresaw and Prophesied, that the very first breach of Gods Ordinance in matching Her self with a Prince of a diverse Faith, would infallibly carry with it some piece of the rending distiny, which <hi>Solomon</hi> and some other of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Princes, justly felt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The course which he took in this great business, was not by murmur among equals, or <note place="margin">His Wisdom.</note> inferiours to detract from his Prince; but he made an humble Address of these reasons to the Queen her self, to whom the appeal was proper: So that altho he found a sweet stream of Soveraign humours in that well tempered Lady, to run against him, yet found he safety in Her self against that self-ness which appeared to threaten him in her. For this happily born and bred Princess, was not (Subject-like) apt to construe things, done reverently, in the worst sense: But rather, with the Spirit of anoynted Greatness (as Created to raign equally over frail and strong) more desirous to find wayes to fashion her People, than colours, or causes to punish them.</p>
               <p>After this he designed a Voyage, with Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> to the <hi>West Indies,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing (if God prospered them) to settle a Plantation upon the Continent of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi> and when the Fleet was almost ready to set sail, he stole from the Court (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Queen) purposing to have gone along with it himself; but before he could get off, the Queen being informed of it Commanded himback, promising to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62667:165"/> him employment, under his Uncle, the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> and upon <note place="margin">Made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Flush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </note> his return to the Court, was instantly made Governour of the Garrison of <hi>Flushing,</hi> and for Field employment, General of the Horse: In both which charges, his demeanour testified to the World both Wisdom and Valour, with the addition of honor to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by them.</p>
               <p>For instance, How like a Soldier did he behave himself, first in contriving, then in executing the surprise of <hi>Axil?</hi> where he revived that Ancient, and secure discipline of order and silence in their march: And after their entrance into the Town, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Band of choice Soldiers to make a stand in the Market place, for security to the rest that were forced to wander up and down by direction of their Commanders; and when the service was done, he rewarded that obedience of discipline in every one, liberally, out of his own Purse.</p>
               <p>Again, how providently did he preserve the Lives and honour of our <hi>English</hi> Army at that enterprise of <hi>Gravelin?</hi> where tho he was guided by directions given him; yet whither out out of Arguments drawn from the person of <hi>La Motte,</hi> Governour of <note place="margin">His foresight.</note> that Town, who had a general reputation of too much worth; either to deceive, or easily to be deceived; or out of the strength and importance of that place, precious to the owner in many respects, the least of which would redouble loss to the growing Ambition of a Conquerour; or whether, upon caution given by intelligence; or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever light of diversion else, he was resolute not to hazard so many principal Gentlemen, with such gallant Troops, and Commanders, which accompanied him in that flattering expedition. Yet because he kept this steady Counsel in his own bosome, there was great labouring on every side, to obtain the honour of that service: To all which gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant kind of competition, he made this answer; That his own coming hither was to the same end, wherein they were now become his Rivals: and also he assured them that he would not yield any thing to any man, which by right of his place, was both due to himself, and consequently a disgrace for him to execute by others. Again, that by the same Rule, he would never consent to hazard them that were his Friends, and in divers respects, his Equals, where he found reason to make many doubts, and so little reason to venture himself.</p>
               <p>Yet as a Commander, concluding that something was fit to be done, equally for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bience and tryal, he made the inferior Captains, try their chance by a Die upon a Drum head. The Lot fell upon Sir <hi>William Brown,</hi> his own Lieutenant, who with a choice Company presently departed, receiving this charge from Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> that if he found falshood, and not faith, he should presently throw down his Arms, and yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Prisoner; protesting that if they took him, he should be ransomed: If they broke Quarter, his Death should be severely revenged.</p>
               <p>On go these forlorn Companies with this their Leader, and before they came into the Town, found all outward signs exactly performed, and when they were entred, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Street safe and quiet, according to promise, till they were past an easie recovery of the Gate; when instantly, out of the Cellars under-ground, they were charged both by Horse and Foot: The Leader, following his Generals command, discovering the the Treason, threw down his Arms, and was taken Prisoner: The rest of the Company retired, or rather fled towards their Ships, but were still wounded, and some cut off by their pursuing enemies, till at last a Serjeant of a Company, with fifteen more (all <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's</hi> men) that is, such as could die to get honour and to do service for their Country, made an <hi>Halt,</hi> and being happily mixed of Pikes, Halberds, and Muskets, resolved to die with their backs to their Friends, and their faces to their Enemies: They retired, or stayed as occasion offered it self, and were in both hotly charged both with Horse and Foot, till in the end eight of them were slain, and eight left alive. The Serjeant was wounded on the side by a square Bullet out of a Field peice, who made this brave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat within view, at last, and under the Protection of their own Navy; Bringing home, even in his Wounds reputation of courage, and Martial Discipline into his Country.</p>
               <p>In a quarrel between the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and Count <hi>Hollock</hi> (who was the Head of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against the Earl) how discreetly did Sir <hi>Philip</hi> ballance that brave Count? when putting himself between indignities, offered to his Soveraign, through the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <note place="margin">His great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> he brought those passionate charges, which the Noble Count addressed upward to the Earl, by degrees down upon himself, where that brave Count <hi>Hollock</hi> found Sir <hi>Philip</hi> so fortified with wisdom, courage, and truth, beside the strong party of former friendship
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62667:165"/> standing for him in the Counts noble Nature: Yea, though sense of Honour, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things else, equal and unequal between them, were in appearance beyond possibility of peicing; yet this one inequality of Sir <hi>Philips</hi> right on his side, made the Count calm; and by coming to terms of expostulation, did only reconcile those two haughty Spirits, one to another, more firmly than before; But withal, through himself wrought, if not a kind of Unity between the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> and Count <hi>Hallock,</hi> yet at least a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal surcease of all violent jealousies, or factious expostulation.</p>
               <p>To be short, not in Complements, and Arts, but real proofs given of his sufficiency above others: In a very little time his Repututation, and Authority among the active people, grew so fast, that it had been no hard matter for him, with the disadvantage of his Uncle, and the distraction of our Affairs in those parts, to have raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Fortune there. But in the whole course of his Life, he did so constantly bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance Ambition, with the safe Precepts of divine and moral Duty, as no pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever could have enticed this worthy Gentleman, to break through the Circle of a good Patriot.</p>
               <p>Now we are come to speak of his death; wherein he shewed in a short progress to a long home, passing fair and well-drawn Lines, by the guidance of which, all <hi>Pilgrims</hi> of this Life may be humbly conducted into the Haven of <hi>Everlasting rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When that unhappy stand was to be made before <hi>Zutphen,</hi> to stop the issuing out of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Arms from a Siege; with what alacrity soever he went to Actions of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet remembring upon what just grounds the <hi>Ancient Sages</hi> describe the worthiest Persons to best Armed, he had compleatly put on his: But meeting the Marshal of the Camp, but lightly Armed, the unspotted emulation of his heart, to venture without any inequality, made him cast off his Caresses, and so by the secret influence of the Wise Gods Providence, he disarmed that part, where God (as it seems) had resolved to strike him.</p>
               <p>Thus they went on, every man at the head of his own Troop; and, the Weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Misty, they fell unawares upon the Enemy, who had made a strong stand to receive them, near unto the very Walls of <hi>Zutphen.</hi> By reason of which accident, their Troops fell, not only unexpectedly to be engaged within the level of the great shot that played from the Rampiers, but more fatally within the shot of their Musquets, which were laid in Ambush within their own Trenches.</p>
               <p>By this stand an unhappy hand, out of those Trenches, brake the bone of Sir <hi>Philips</hi> Thigh, with a Musket shot, above the left knee, which so shivered the bone that the Bullet could not be got out. The horse whereon he rode, was rather furiously cholerick <note place="margin">He is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> than bravely Proud, and so forced him to forsake the Field but not his back; which was the Noblest, and fittest Biere to carry a Martial Commander to his Grave: In which sad passage, going along by the rest of the Army, where his Uncle, the General was, and being thirsty with excess of bleeding, he called for some Drink, which was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought him. But as he was putting the Bottle to his mouth, he saw a poor Soldier carried along (who had eaten his last at the same Feast) gastly casting up his Eies at the said Bottle; which Sir <hi>Philip</hi> taking notice of, took it from his own head, before he drank, and gave it to the poor man, with these words: <hi>Thy necessity is yet greater than</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Compassion.</note>
                  <hi>mine.</hi> And when he had pledged this poor Soldier, he was presently carried to <hi>Arnheim</hi> in <hi>Gelderland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this place the principal Chyrurgions of the Camp attended his coming: Some mercenarily, seeking their own gain: Others out of a desire to honour their Art; but the most of them, with a true Zeal (compounded of love and reverence) to do him good, and (as they thought) many Nations in him.</p>
               <p>When they went about to dress his Wound, he, both by way of charge, and advise, told them, that whilst his strength was yet entire, and his Body free from a Fever, and his mind able to endure it, they might freely use their Art; cut, and search the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: For, besides his hope of health, he would make this farther profit of his pains which he should suffer, that they might witness, they had indeed a sensible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured man under their hands, yet one to whom a stronger Spirit had given power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove himself either to do or suffer. But if they should now neglect to use their Art, and renew his torments in the declination of nature, the ignorance, or over-tenderness, <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> would prove a kind of Tyranny to their Friend, and consequently a blemish to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Science.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:62667:166"/>
               <p> With love and care well mixt, the Chirurgeons began the Cure, and continued it sixteen Days, not only with hope, but rather with such confidence of his recovery, as the joy of their hearts overflowed their discretion, and made them spread the Intelligence of it to our Queen, and to all his noble Friends herein <hi>England,</hi> where it was received not as private, but as publick Good news.</p>
               <p>Only there was one <hi>Owl</hi> among all the other Birds, who, though looking with no less zealous eyes than the rest, yet saw, and presaged reason for despair. He was an excellent Chirurgion of Count <hi>Hollocks,</hi> who, altho the Count himself lay at the same instant hurt in the Throat with a Musket Bullet, yet he neglected his own extremity, to save his Friend, and for that end, had sent him to Sir <hi>Philip.</hi> This Chyrurgion (out of love to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) had made bold one day to return to dress his Wound, and whilst he was doing it, the Count chearfully asked him, how Sir <hi>Philip</hi> did? and being answered, with a heavy countenance, <hi>that he was not well:</hi> At which words this worthy Prince (as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more sense of his Friends wounds than his own) cryed out: <hi>Away Villain; never see my face again, till thou bringest me better News of that mans recovery; for whose redemption, many such as I were happily lost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now after the sixteenth day was past, and the very Shoulder-bones of this delicate Patient were worn through his skin, with constant, and obedient posturing of his body <note place="margin">Great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to the Chyrurgions directions; He judicious<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly observing the pangs which his Wound stang him with by fits, together with many other <hi>Symptoms</hi> of decay, but few or none of recovery, he began rather to submit his body to these <hi>Artists,</hi> than any farther to believe, or trust to them. During which suspence, he one morning lifting up the Bed cloths for change and ease of his body, smelt some extroardinary noisom favour proceeding from him, differing from the smells of Oils and Salves; and either out of natural delicacy, or at least, his care not to offend others, grew a little troubled at it: which they that set by, perceiving, besought him to let them know, what suddain indisposition he felt? Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> as ingenuously told them what it was, and desired them, as ingenuously to confess whether they smelt any such noisom sents or no? They all protested against it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their credits: whereupon Sir <hi>Philip</hi> gave this severe doom upon himself, that it was some inward mortification, and a welcome messenger of Death.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, when the Chyrurgions came to dress his wounds, he acquainted them with these peircing intelligences between him, and his Mortality: which though they opposed by the Authority of Books, parallelling of accidents, and other artificial proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; yet moved they no alteration in this worthy Person, who judged too truly of his own estate, and that from more certain grounds than the vanity of opinion of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Artificers could possibly pierce into. So that afterwards, how freely soever he left his body subject to their practice upon it, and continued a Patient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond exception; yet did he not change his mind: But as having cast off all hope, or desire of recovery, he made and divided that little span of Life which was left him, in this manner.</p>
               <p>First, he called the Ministers unto him; who were all excellent men of divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note place="margin">Piety.</note> and before them made such a Confession of his Christian Faith, as no Books, but the heart can truly and freely deliver. Then desired he them to accompany him in Prayer, wherein he craved leave to lead the Assembly, in respect (as he said) that the secret sins of his own heart were best known to himself, and out of a true sense of them, he was the more properly enabled to apply the Eternal sacrifice of his blessed Saviours Passion and Merits to himself. And his Religious desires, were easily assented to by this humbly devout and afflicted Company; and he, in the performance of the Duty, however they were all moved, and much affected, and those sweet motions were witnessed by their deep sighs, groans, and tears: Yet could no man easily judg of himself, much less of others, whether these heavenly Raptures proceeded from sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for him, or admiration of him: The Fire of this <hi>Phaenix</hi> hardly being able out of any Ashes to produce his equal as they conceived.</p>
               <p>After a while he concluded his Zealous, and fervent Prayer; whether to give rest to that frail, wounded flesh of his, unable to bear the bent of Eternity so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, any longer: Or whether to abstract that Spirit more inwardly, and by chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it were) the Cud of Meditation, to imprint those excellent Images in his Soul; who can tell but God?</p>
               <p>Not long after he intreated these Divines, to recal to mind what was the opinion of the Heathen, touching the immortality of the Soul. First, to see what true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62667:166"/> she retains of her own Essence, out of the light of her self. Then to Parallel with it the most pregnant Authorities of the <hi>Old and New Testament,</hi> as supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Revelations, sealed up from our Flesh, for the Divine Light of Faith to reveal and work by. Not that he wanted Information or Assurance: But because this fixing of a Lovers thoughts, upon those external beauties, tended not only to the cheering up of his decaying Spirits; But, as it were, a taking possession of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marcessible, and eternal Inheritance, which was due unto him, by vertue of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-hood in Christ.</p>
               <p>The next thing that he did, was the calling for his <hi>Will;</hi> which, tho at first sight <note place="margin">Publishes his Will.</note> it may seem a descent from Heaven to Earth again; yet he that observes the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of those offices, which he practised in bestowing his own, may discern, that as the Soul of Man is all in all, and all in every part; so was his goodness equally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed into the greatest, and least actions of his short Life; which <hi>Will</hi> of his, will ever remain for a witness to the world that those sweet and large, even dying Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his, could no more be contracted with the narrowness of pain, grief, or sickness, than any sparkle of our immortality can be privately buried in the shadow of Death.</p>
               <p>The last <hi>Scene</hi> of this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> was the parting between the two Brethren; the <note place="margin">His Death.</note> weaker shewing wonderful strength in suppressing his sorrow, and the stronger great weakness in expressing of it. So far did invaluable worthiness, in the dying Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, enforce the living to descend beneath his own worth, and by abundance of Childish Tears, bewail the publick in his particular loss. Yea, so far was his true remission of mind transformed into ejulation, that Sir <hi>Philip</hi> (in whom all earthly Passions, did even, as it were flash, like lights ready to burn out) recalled those Spirits together, with a strong virtue, but weak voice; mildly blamed him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing the frail strengths left to support him in his final combate of separation at hand. And to stop this natural Torrent of perfection in both, he took his leave with these admonishing words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love my Memory, Cherish my Friends; Their faith to me may assure you that they are honest. But above all Govern your Will, and Affections, by the Will, and Word of your Creator; in me beholding the end of this world, with all her vanities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manner of his Death and the mourning for his loss, his Exequies and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs made upon him, see in a brief account given of his Life and Death in my first Volume of Lives, page 35 in the third Alphabet.</p>
               <p>After his death the States of <hi>Zealand</hi> became Suitors to her Majesty and his Noble Friends, that they might have the Honour of burying his Body at the Publick charge of their Government. A memorable Example of Thankfulness, by honouring, and well handling the Dead, to encourage the living: Which Request, had it been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Reader may please to consider what Trophics, it is likely, they would have erected over him for Posterity to admire, and what Inscriptions would have been devised for Eternizing his memory.</p>

His Valour.</note> in his <hi>Irish Chronicle</hi> tells us) he came into <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Captain in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Reign, <hi>Anno Christ.</hi> 1601. <hi>September</hi> the fourth: And did brave, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable service against the Earl of <hi>Tyr-owen,</hi> and his Adherents. And those Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, as the Lord made him instrumental to promote peace, so was he as vigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to preserve, and continue it afterwards. Many combinations of Theevish Crews, <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> and Trayterous Conspiracies, in the Province of <hi>Connaught,</hi> and in the confines of <hi>Ʋl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> he dissipated; making some of the most notorious Offenders, by exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, <note place="margin">His Justice.</note> a terror to the rest: And on the other hand, delivering the poor innocent from such as were too strong for them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>He brake the jawes of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of their Teeth. The blessing of them that were ready to perish came upon him; and he caused the strangers heart to sing for joy. He put on Righteouss and it clothed him, and his Judgment was a Robe, a Diadem,</hi> Job. 29. 12, 13. 14. Many years together did he shine as an eminent and bright star in the <hi>Irish Horizon.</hi> He was nothing daunted, or discouraged with the false Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of some, or with the weak, and foolish credulity of others. For he knew, that as the shadow follows the body of such as walk in the Sun; so doth <hi>envy</hi> attend worth and virtue. <hi>In Sole ambulantes necessario umbra sequitur; In honore &amp; Dignitate viventes</hi>

                  <hi>Invidia comitatur,</hi> saith <hi>Maximus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before the eruption of the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion, it pleased God to visit him with sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <note place="margin">His Conversion</note> and thereby to convince him of his sins, and of his need of a Saviour. And upon his recovery he sent for some Spiritual <hi>Physicians,</hi> to whom he ingenuously opened the Estate of his Soul, and took their Counsel what he might do to procure Pardon and Reconciliation with God, and he had fully observed what they said, and as carefully put it in practice to the everlasting good of his Soul. For he was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ever-after, to be a very constant and due resorter to the Publick Ordinances, and a large contributer towards their maintenance, having in high esteem the faithful Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers <note place="margin">Ministers loved</note> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> for their <hi>work-sake,</hi> and expressing singular affections to the generation of Gods people.</p>
               <p>He was like unto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that famous <hi>Centurion,</hi> frequent in Prayer, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Alms-deeds. His Noble prowess rendred him terrible to his Enemies round about, and the Lord of Hosts made him very succesful in his undertakings. For as <hi>David</hi> said of <hi>Jonathan: From the Blood of the Slain, and from the fat of the Mighty his Sword returned not empty.</hi> His rare dexterity in animating and encouraging his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, his winning demeanour, affable and seasonable Speeches, and his Prudent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his affairs, made him great among his People, and accepted (with <hi>Mordecai, Hest.</hi> 10. 3.) of the multitude of his Brethren: For all saw that he sought the welfare of his Nation, and put his life in his hand to procure their safety.</p>
               <p>After the breaking out of that horrid Rebellion, which began <hi>October</hi> 23. <hi>Anno Christ.</hi> 1641. presently the <hi>State</hi> at <hi>Dublin</hi> had information that the design of the Enemies was to besiege <hi>Droheda,</hi> whereupon they presently sent all the forces, which could then be possibly raised, to the strengthening of that Garrison, after whose departue, they had no considerable strength left in <hi>Dublin</hi> for the defence of that City, which was the Metropolis of the Kingdom, and which being lost, all had been lost with it, and some of those which they had, were Persons little to be confided in.</p>
               <p>The numerous and subtile Enemies being quickly informed hereof, presently drew together all their strength, and begirt the City round. In this forlorn, and almost desperate condition, some of the Ministers pressed the Council dayly for a Publick Fast, as the only remedy left unto them: But it could not be obtained (through the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness of some who should have been most forward in such a work) till the twelfth of <hi>November</hi> following: And it pleased God that very Evening after their General Humiliation, to give them a signal, and gracious return to their Prayers; whereby <note place="margin">Prayer preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</note> they were experimentally taught, that their best weapons were (as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaks) <hi>preces &amp; Lachrimae:</hi> Prayers and Tears.</p>
               <p>For as the Spirit of God came upon <hi>Othniel,</hi> and raised him up to deliver <hi>Israel</hi> in their deep distress <hi>(Judg.</hi> 3. 9. 10.) when they cryed unto him: So did the Spirit of Magnanimity and fortitude, suddenly fall upon this Noble, and magnanimous Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and ancient, expert Soldier, who had long before that day, been aged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit by reason of sickness, hardly able to set his Feet to the ground. Yet in the mighty strength of God he went in to the Council-Table, and tendred his service to go forth against the Enemy, accounting and esteeming it (as he told them) mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Eligible and desirable to die in the Field, than to be slain within their Houses.</p>
               <p>This motion was no less acceptable, than it was seasonable: But some judged that it would prove abortive, saying, The good mans Spirit is willing, but his Body is too weak for such a work. Others demanded where he would have Men for the service? But the present and pressing exigences would admit of no long consultations.</p>
               <p>The State knew his pristine valour, commended his present resolution, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him their ready and best assistance, at this time he only was left of all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient worthies who had been ingaged in the Wars of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom time had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er worn out, or age and infirmities had disabled from such an undertaking: But
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62667:167"/> the Lord renewed his strength as the Eagles. For when he heard the rueful and doleful outcries, and beheld the prodigious, and never enough to be lamented mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of the stript and starved <hi>English,</hi> which surpasseth all expression, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly <note place="margin">Sympathy.</note> moved in his Spirit, and prayed unto the Lord to endue him with strength from Heaven, that he might be able before he dyed to give three or four defeats to those bloody and barbarous Rebels, who were the Authors of such great Indignities, and of the numberless, and unconceivable sufferings of an innocent and helpless People.</p>
               <p>This Prayer the Lord hearkened and assented to: For immediately of weak he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <note place="margin">His Faith.</note> strong, and to the admiration of all men, he went forth in confidence of the assistance of Almighty God, and by Faith put to flight those that rose up against him, so that all could not but see and acknowledged, that the Lord was with him. For having received the afore▪mentioned acceptance and encouragement from the <hi>State,</hi> he went forth, and with all speed took up all men which came next to hand, most of which were such as had been stripped, and half starved, and that never had been trained to the Wars. These <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e led forth, to the number of seven Hundred (at the most) into the County of <hi>Wicklow,</hi> where the strength of the Enemy was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred, and there he charged, and fell upon them: At the first encounter his raw Soldiers were disranked, and put into some confusion; But he with admirable skill and dexterity, soon rallied them together again; fell upon the Enemy, and by Gods special assistance routed them, and returned with the loss of any one man, excepting <note place="margin">His Victories.</note> one only, whom himself shot as he was running over to the Rebels.</p>
               <p>This mercy seemed to the Protestants in <hi>Dublin</hi> no less than a Resurrection from the dead, and afforded them cause and matter of joyful thankfulness to Almighty God the giver of Victories. By it also they were animated and encouraged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their weekly dayes of Fasting, Prayer, and Humiliation, unto which they had an exceeding great concourse of the <hi>English</hi> in their Congregation: And as <hi>Josuah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> prevailed, whilst <hi>Moses</hi> held up his Hand: So as long as they continued in <note place="margin">Prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</note> Publick Prayers and supplications, their Armies prevailed abroad till they became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Field, during the space of a whole year and an half.</p>
               <p>After that first action Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> went out again with his party, took and burnt <hi>Claneart,</hi> a place neer to the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which the Enemies had filled with Rapine and Blood: He took in also the Garrisons of the <hi>Naas,</hi> and <hi>Trim:</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd the Rebels out of the <hi>Navan.</hi> And lastly he encountered with the whole Body of the Enemy at <hi>Kilrush,</hi> where he fought a pitch't Battel with them, and routed their vast multitudes, and would have pursued them farther if he might have had his will, with such heat and vigour: But he was commanded back: And now the number of his desired Victories being made up, with some overplus, in his last battle neer unto <hi>Trim,</hi> he was slain, being shot (as it was verily believed) by one of his own Party, into the body, having a little before, with three or four Troops of horse, <note place="margin">His Death.</note> chased three or four Thousands of the Enemies for the space of two Miles, and left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four hundred dead upon the place.</p>
               <p>Thus dyed this Honourable Patriot, and Noble Champion in the Lords work, and Victorious, in the sixty fifth year of his Age, wherein (as <hi>Cato Major</hi> said of Q. <hi>Maximus,) Hic Bella gerebat ut Adolescens, cum plane grandis esset.</hi> He warred in his old age, as if he had been a young man. He was like <hi>Caleb</hi> for strength, as able <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Josu.</hi> 14. 11.</note> for the War, both to go out and come in, as he was in the day when he was first sent over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> having a quarter of an hour before his Death, slain with his Sword, a Rebel of a great Stature, hand to hand.</p>
               <p>The greatness of the Adversaries rejoycing at the fall of this great Man, shewed the greatness of the Protestants loss, in the loss of him. But nothing befel him, but what hath befallen the dearest of Gods Servant. <hi>Sampson</hi> is reckoned in the Catalogue of Believers <hi>(Heb.</hi> 11. 32.) who slew more at his Death than in all his Life: Yet he perished among the uncircumcized <hi>Philistians.</hi> By the the Sword of the <hi>Philistines</hi> gracious <hi>Jonathan</hi> afterwards fell upon Mount <hi>Gilboa,</hi> which occasioned much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to <hi>Israels</hi> unplacable Enemies. Faithful <hi>Ʋriah,</hi> was also betrayed by <hi>Joab</hi> at the Kings Command, and cut off by the Sword of the Children of <hi>Ammon.</hi> Yea, Godly <hi>Josiah,</hi> to whom there was none like, before or after him, among all the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> yet was he slain by the Sword of <hi>Paraoh Necho.</hi> The Sword devoureth one as well as an other: And all things fall a like to all, and no man can judge of love or hatred by all that is before him.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:62667:168"/>
               <p> This Noble Champion counted it more eligible and honourable to die in the Field fighting for his Religion, and Countrymen against the <hi>Popish</hi> barbarous <hi>Irish,</hi> than to be murthered in his house by them: Wise men in all Ages have agreed upon this <hi>maxim,</hi> which was <hi>Augustus Caesars</hi> Motto, <hi>Oportet Imperatorem stantem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi> This was the Noble Knights desire, and God gave him his option: He was taken away by this eligible and honourable death; for he died on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, being upheld by his Son, riding behind him, till he was brought into his own Quarters.</p>
               <p>One thing more was very remarkable, and therefore is not to be forgotten; that whilst they in <hi>Dublin</hi> continued their weekly Fasts, and Dayes of Humiliation, the Protestant Party constantly prevailed in the Field, and became Masters of the Field, for the space of a whole year and an half, as was hinted before: But some of the City Ministers, being sore pressed with this long continued burden of keeping two weekly <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> as they called it, made their address to the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for mitigation, Alleadging that their Enemies were well brought under: That their Straits and Fears were removed: That now they were become their Enemies Superiors, and therefore they judged that a Monthly Fast might well suffice. And at length, their daily importunity prevailed, so that they were reduced to a Monthly Fast. But no sooner had they intermitted one of their former Fast dayes, but that the very next day came the dismal and deplorable News from the Army that Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> was slain.</p>
               <p>These things were attested and declared by <hi>faithful Teat,</hi> D. D. then Lecturer in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> in his Sermon Preached in <hi>Christs-Church, May</hi> the <hi>14th.

                  </gap> came together with his Wife <hi>Mary,</hi> to shelter themselves and to enjoy the free Profession of the true Protestant Religion (for which they had left the fruition, and possession of all their Temporal, and worldly goods and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, which were very considerable) under the protection of that famous Nursing-Mother of Gods afflicted Children in those bloody times, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed memory, here in <hi>England,</hi> in the fourth year of her Reign; taken up his Residence at <hi>Colchester</hi> aforesaid, where he lived many years in very good esteem, and was very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and industrious in setting up and promoting the great and useful Manufacture of making <hi>Sayes,</hi> and <hi>Bayes,</hi> first brought into <hi>England</hi> by those Exiles for the great good and profit of our Nation: and God exceedingly blessed him, not only in his Calling, but in giving him a hopeful issue. He died in a good Old Age in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as both these Parents had made Piety their chiefest, and greatest interest, and the free exercise of Religion their best purchase, so they were alwayes exceeding diligent <note place="margin">His Education.</note> and solicitous to season their Children, and this their Son <hi>John</hi> especially, from the very Cradle, with the knowledge, fear, and nurture of the Lord, and that with such a blessed success upon their godly labours, that they hereby found the seeds of Piety springing up in him, which being watered by the constant use of the publick Ordinances, by Gods grace and blessing, continued and grew up to maturity, and he never departed from it to his dying day.</p>
               <p>His carriage and deportment through the whole course of his Life, both in his general and particular Calling, and in all his Relations, was not only inoffensive but exemplary. <note place="margin">His holy carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in his youth.</note> For even in his younger years, he was never given to, nor delighted with those vain and sinful sports and pastimes to which youth ordinarily is too much addicted, and so hard to be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62667:168"/> weaned from. His usual Recreation was to turn from one honest, or pious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another. He was from his youth brought up to the Calling of a Merchant, and was alwayes very careful, active, and industrious therein. And when he had leisure from it, or was tired with it, he would betake himself to reading the sacred Scriptures; To learning Languages, or reading best Histories, especially such as treated of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, <note place="margin">His industry.</note> and deliverances of the Church of God: And that shewed how the Gospel was propagated and spread from one Country to another: All which he made (in a manner) his own: Such delight he took, both in the perusal, and rehersal of the same upon all occasions; and yet these were no hindrance to his attendance upon the publick Ordinances, whereby he might nourish Communion with God at any time.</p>
               <p>He used often to bless God, for that according to his earnest prayers, when he <note place="margin">Thanksgiving.</note> came first to <hi>London,</hi> he had kept him from bad Company, and from all allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and engaging occasions of haunting Taverns, and such like places of Debauchery, whereby so many young men came to be ruin'd and undone.</p>
               <p>When he was grown up to some greater maturity of years, and grace, and of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, he began to Trade for himself; wherein his singular care and punctual exactness in keeping his word and promise; His industry and prudence in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging his affairs, was soon taken notice of, and he had more credit given him in his first beginning, than many who had been for some time Traders before him. Every one was ready, yea, desirous to trust him, and to deal with him; which great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he nevertheless used soberly and moderately, undertaking no more, than he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> to mannage, and what he had once undertaken, he with all vigilance, and industry at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, following the Duties of his Calling diligently, and Gods blessing did so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his endeavours, and affairs, that his Estate encreased apace, and yet he would often say, <hi>that he was not hastily rich.</hi>

               <p>With this pious Consort he lived comfortably many years, and had by her several <note place="margin">His Children.</note> gracious Children, eight in all, whereof six (namely, two Sons, and four Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) died in their minority. The two Daughters which survived, the Elder <hi>Hester,</hi> who was first married to <hi>John Manning,</hi> Esq; an eminent Merchant of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> by whom she had three Children, but they all died before him. And after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease, she was married to Sir <hi>Thomas Honywood,</hi> Knight, of <hi>Marks-hal</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> who lived long and happily together, much beloved and honoured by all that knew them: By him she had seven Children, of whom two Sons and one Daughter survived the rest. The younger Daughter <hi>(Elizabeth)</hi> was married to a worthy Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Maurice Abbot</hi> (Son to Sir <hi>Maurice Abbot,</hi> sometime Lord Mayor, and an honourable Alderman of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and Brother to those two famous <hi>Abbots,</hi> Doctor <hi>George Abbot,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Robert Abbot,</hi> the eminently Learned, Bishop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury)</hi>

               <p>For the nourishment and encrease of Piety in his Soul, and maintaining Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">His holy Duties</note> with God, he was constant and diligent in attendance upon the publick Ordinance and means of Grace, not only in the <hi>Dutch Church,</hi> whereof he was made a Member, but also in the Parish Church wherein his Habitation was, and wherein were several Lectures, which he frequented, as I my self observed, who was his near Neighbour for many years. And in private by reading the Scripture, and meditating therein, he had so possessed and filled his soul with an heavenly Treasure, that most of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses, and letters to his Friends, favoured of an heavenly frame of heart, as one that had his Conversation in Heaven, whilst his Commoration was upon the earth: And he often expressed a great deal of heart-grief and astonishment, at most mens heedlesness <note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> and negligence about businesses and duties that did so much and so nearly concern the everlasting salvation of their precious, and immortal souls.</p>
               <p>His real piety and acquaintance with God appeared sufficiently, as by many other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoveries; so in a special manner by those streams of true Christian charity, which <note place="margin">His Charity.</note> freely, and uncessantly flowed from him, as water from the fountain; or Life-hony that droppeth from the Combs without pressing. Yea, he was not only willing and ready to communicate, and impart himself to the wants and necessities of such as were in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, but was a great provoker, and encourager of others to the like duty; setting (all as it were) on fire with compassion that came near him.</p>
               <p>But his bounty did never run so freely as in those times wherein any publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities befel the Church and people of God: No care, no trouble, no pains, no cost was then judged too much, whereby he might testifie his <hi>Sympathizing</hi> bowels with <note place="margin">His Sympathy.</note> them, for their sorrows and afflictions, whether at home or abroad. They which are strangers to a bountiful heart, will scarce believe what sums of money he disburs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in works of Charity since the year 1620, in the respective Persecutions, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Rochel,</hi> in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in <hi>Germany:</hi> And more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Lower,</hi> and <hi>Ʋpper Palatinate:</hi> And therein, above other places, in the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued distresses of the City of <hi>Frankendale:</hi> Besides many other Cases nearer home in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> And in that cruel and barbarous Massacre in <hi>Piemont,</hi> not long before his death, when a general Collection was made for those poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures who survived that storm, the Minister and some other of the Parish wherein he lived [Saint <hi>Bartholomews Exchange]</hi> going to his house to see what he would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and sending up word to him, what was the occasion of their coming, he came to <note place="margin">His Bounty.</note> them, and told them that they had a Collection in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregation for them, where he had contributed twenty pound. And (saith he) <hi>the Devil hath tempted me to put you off with this Answer; but he shall not prevail, and therefore here is ten pound for you more upon this occasion.</hi> This was told me by the Minister [Mr. <hi>Thomas Cauton]</hi> a day or two after.</p>
               <p>And that God who gave him such largness of heart and freeness of hand, gave him also wisdom and understanding, to mannage and order all his affairs with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> He knew both when and where to spend, by which prudence he was still able to do more good; And he always found, and acknowledged both the Temporal, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual returns, and comforts of this his Beneficence. And this made him always (as God blessed him) to lay aside a part and portion, which he as truly and carefully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed upon the first opportunity, that tendred themselves to him.</p>
               <p>But if God was pleased at any time to exercise him with Crosses and Losses of any kind, in his outward estate (whereof he had his share among other of Gods dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) by casualties at Sea or Land, at home and abroad; in his several employments, or in his Relations; and especially in his body by divers great infirmities, and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, principally toward, and in the latter part of his life; yet in all these he shewed abundance of Christian patience, and holy submission to the good hand and pleasure <note place="margin">His patience.</note> of the All-wise God and his heavenly Father, and merciful Redeemer: Comforting himself very much by meditating upon the Example of <hi>Jacob, Joseph, Job, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> &amp;c. and of others of Gods faithful Saints, and Servants in all Ages, who had drunk of the same Cup before him; with whose Histories he was exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</p>
               <p>He was frequent in praising God for his mercies extended to his outward man, <note place="margin">His thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62667:170"/> who had so long vouchsafed, and continued to him the blessing of his sight and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such a good and comfortable measure, as that thereby he could partake of, and enjoy the benefit of Gods holy Ordinances both in publick and private: And for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, that in all his troubles and afflictions, God never long withdrew, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the time of his last sickness, he did not much vent himself by discourses: But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired <note place="margin">His last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> themselves and unbosomed his heart, and spread his condition before the Lord in Prayer. About three weeks before his Decease he was sorely afflicted with the Head-ach, in extremity, and with the Cholick, in so much as he began to find some impatience to seize upon him; But he soon recollected his thoughts, and checked himself, saying: <hi>How often, and how fervently have I besought the Lord, that he would be pleased to fit and prepare me for himself, and for his everlasting Kingdom; And why then should I find fault, and repine against his Dispensations, now when he thus really and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doth prepare me, making me by these very pains and torments, to loath this wretched world so much the more, and to long for my blessed and happy change and dissolution, and to be with</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Death.</note>
                  <hi>my Redeemer.</hi> And thus he continued for the most part longing to be with. <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> even to his last hour, which was <hi>July</hi> the <hi>13th. Anno Christi</hi> 1655. in the seventy ninth <note place="margin">His Faith.</note> year of his Age.</p>
               <p>When death came, he looked it in the Face without consternation, as of which he was not afraid, being implanted into <hi>Christ,</hi> and thereby freed from the slavish fear of death. His Meditations and his Speeches were much upon this subject, whereby he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to familiarize Death both to himself and others; knowing that this was a very effectual means to make us apply our hearts to wisdom, that is to say, to the fear of God, the only <hi>Antidote</hi> against all base and servile fears.</p>
               <p>And as in his troubles and afflictions he shewed a great deal of filial submission to the good will and pleasure of God, his heavenly Father; so it was a great Comfort and refreshing to all that conversed with him, to observe and hear his continual Thankful Remembrances of Gods Mercies and Goodness to the Church, whether abroad or at <note place="margin">Thankfulness.</note> home: And to that Land or Nation wherein he lived: As also to any of his near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or dear Friends, as well as to his own Person. This was a string that he would be often touching: An Argument he delighted to hear and speak of: He would ever and anon cry out most feelingly. <hi>O what cause have we to bless and praise our good and merciful God, who yet preserveth, delights in, delivers and favours us, and passes by and forgives our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold infirmities, trangressions, and provocations, which are aggravated by our great and brutish ingratitude! O that at the length we would love him, believe in him, and walk in his fear and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to our everlasting happiness.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Feasts.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Every year upon the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> which was the day when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown, that put an end to the <hi>Maryan</hi> Persecution, he made a Feast. And before it was ended he would stand up and tell his Guests, what cause there was of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing upon that day for Gods signal mercy shewed to <hi>England,</hi> in restoring the Light of the Gospel; Quenching the Fires in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and continuing the Peace and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Gospel for so many years, the Number whereof he would alwayes tell them what it was. Also upon other occasions of joy he would invite, and freely entertain his Friends, and tell them that he desired their Company to <hi>eat Bread with him before the Lord</hi> (as <hi>Jethro,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> did): And would take occasion to speak of some signal Mercies and Deliverances, whereof his Memory was a Living Library, especially of those grand Deliverances, both before and since the Reformation of Religion in <hi>England:</hi> As also the Deliverances of the Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> and in the <hi>Low Covntries,</hi> whereof he would often Discourse in so punctual, and feeling a manner, as if himself had been an Eye witness, yea, a sharer in them: Taking and using many Arguments from thence to stir up himself and others to have a sense and feeling of the Bonds and Miseries of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, remembring that themselves are in the body: And he would say, that <hi>their case might have been ours: And who knows but that it may yet be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He would often with holy Admiration and Thankfulness take notice of this Mercy, that when his Father (being for Religion forced to fly for his Life) stood doubtful (as many others did) whether he should repair for shelter, to <hi>Frankendale</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> or into <hi>England,</hi> God was pleased to direct, and incline his heart to make choice of <hi>England</hi> for his place of Refuge: And this Mercy was much heightned, considering the sad ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62667:171"/> and miseries that that place and Country afterwards fell into. And this made him to have the greater fellow-felling of their calamities, wherein himself and his might have been involved: whereas on the contrary, God had not only kept him and his in peace and safety, but had exceedingly blessed him in his outward Estate: And this made him very mindful and careful to send them relief upon all occasions. <note place="margin">Prudence.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Together with all these eminent Graces, God had likewise endowed him with a large portion of Wisdom, Judgment, and Understanding, in many things of moment and importance, grounded upon much experience, observation, and practice of his own, for which he was deservedly much esteemed by men of no small place, and account: He still <hi>brought out of his Treasury things both New and Old;</hi> and knew how so pertinently to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, produce, and compare the same, that it was a great pleasure, and no less profit to hear him discoursing of the same.</p>
               <p>His pious and indefatigable care and pains which he took in bringing up his Children, <note place="margin">Piety.</note> and governing his Family in the fear and admonition of the Lord, was in part hinted before. And truly his constant endeavour was to bring them into acquaintance, and communion with God, and to make them to stand in a filial awe of him: He called fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently upon them to read and meditate, and delight themselves in the word of God: To be well grounded, and setled in Religion, that they might not be <hi>carried about with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wind of Doctrine.</hi> As also he admonished them to fly and shun all Idle courses, company, and dalliances. To be painful, careful, and diligent in the Duties of their perticular Callings, and Imployments: To be exact and orderly in all their Affairs: So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and frugal in the use of all Gods good Creatures: Full of bowels of pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to the afflicted and distressed Members of <hi>Christ,</hi> and in general, to all that were in need: That they should be cheerful and ready to Communicate to all such: To be loving and helpful one to another; Obedient to all good Orders; Submissive to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and to all in Authority; Respectful to Ministry; Civil and Upright in their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with all; And watchful at all times; to be in a readiness whensoever the Lord should call them hence, to give an account of their Stewardships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he would tell them, that in all these things he exhorted them to no more than himself endeavoured daily to practice before their Eyes. And that the great care which he had, both for their Souls and Bodies might remain with them after his Decease, not long before he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he left this Letter to his Daughter and Grand-Children for their Instruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beloved Daughter, Dame</hi> Hester Honywood, <hi>and Beloved Grand-Children</hi> Maurice Abbot, <hi>and</hi> Elizabeth, Thomas, John Lamot Honywood, <hi>I do wish you all the blessing and peace of</hi>

                  <hi>God the Father, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, his dear Son, our Saviour and Redeemer: And that his fear and love may be so rooted, and grounded in you, that it may knit, and bind your hearts together in love and amity, as my heart hath been to every one of you; ever praying for you all, that God of his mercy would bless you all, and plant his fear in your hearts, and unfeigned faith in</hi> Christ Jesus <hi>in your souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I desire that no strife, nor envy, nor grudging arise about the dividing of the Estate which the Lord of his mercy hath lent me. For I setled my Land after prayer, by the best Counsels and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise I could: And my personal estate I have by Will (after Prayer) to the best of my skill, in all good Conscience, as equally drawn it as I could; so I would, after I am dead, have you receive it from God, with a thankful and contented mind, and pray to the Lord to bless it to you, and every one of you to his own Posterity. I having been by Trade a Merchant; what by Gods blessing I have advanced, I have endeavoured, and laboured to gain it honestly, and to keep faith, and a good conscience alwayes, ever acknowledging that these following Parties had a share in my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, as in all other mens,</hi> viz. <hi>The Commonwealth, the Service of God, the Ministers, and the poor Members Christ; of whom, as I have endeavoured to be careful, so would I have every one of you to be zealous for the service of God, heartily affectionate to the poor Members of</hi> Christ; <hi>And to give, with the Relief, a comfortable word, when occasion permits.</hi>

               <p>IT's certain that the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and of <hi>Grace</hi> also, hath ever set an <hi>high value</hi> upon the <hi>Memonies</hi> of all just and worthy men; such as have <hi>honoured</hi> and <hi>blest</hi> the World by their <hi>living</hi> in it; as we see proved and illustrated by the ingenious <hi>Writings</hi> of several <hi>Learned and Great Men,</hi> both in the Heathen and the Christian World; besides what we see bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter discovered and confirmed in the sacred Text, where it is said, <hi>The name of the wicked shall rot, but the memory of the Just is blessed. Nature</hi> says, <hi>That the good Lives of men merit praise and an open acknowledgment;</hi> thereby to draw others to the same <hi>perfections,</hi> thereby to preserve the <hi>value</hi> of Mankind, and to <hi>better</hi> the circumstances of an idle impertinent <hi>World,</hi> with the <hi>good</hi> of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, States, Towns and Families: <hi>Grace</hi> says, <hi>That nothing is so good, sweet, and pleasing, both in Life and Death, as to imitate the dear Jesus, and to copy out the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Rules of the Gospel;</hi> to the confirmation of this we may draw in all that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in <hi>whole Divinity,</hi> or treated on in the <hi>holy Bible:</hi> Referring to the case in hand, It was well said by a <hi>Worthy Divine, That it is barbarous Inhumanity in Nature, injurious Detraction in Morality, and wilful disobedience in Divinity, to bury the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Reputation of those in silence and obscurity, whom the Lord by the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Grace hath raised to eminency, and exalted above the Standard of the World:</hi> For what is <hi>humane</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>praise worthy</hi> in Morality, or <hi>commanded</hi> in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, but what belongs to <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy Living?</hi> Then certainly we may make bold to <hi>caress</hi> the <hi>Memory</hi> of him who bears our Title, Sir <hi>Nathaniel Barnardiston;</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:62667:172"/> a Person not fit to be mentioned without a <hi>Preface,</hi> being so <hi>eminently Religious,</hi> and <hi>much to be Honoured;</hi> as we shall easily see, if we search into some only of the most <hi>memorable</hi> passages of his <hi>Birth, Life,</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, To begin with his <hi>Birth.</hi> Both Natural and Divine: Natural, Thus: <note place="margin">His Birth. Natural.</note> He was born in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in that admirable year <hi>One Thousand five hundred eighty and eight;</hi> A year that ever deserves to be with in Letters of God; a year in which the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> designed to have taken away the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>English Protestants,</hi> and with them to have put an end to their <hi>holy Religion;</hi> a Design car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with the utmost Endeavours imagineble, and appeared, when it began to Act, much like the Title of the Navy, that should have managed it, to wit, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible;</hi> but it pleased God wonderfully to overcome and dash in pieces all this Pompous <hi>Strength, Pride,</hi> and <hi>Hope.</hi> It was no small Glory for a man to date his <hi>Nativity</hi> from such an <hi>Eminent Time;</hi> and this Gentleman would often <hi>please</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the remembrance of it. And on the other hand, God did not a little add to the Honour and <hi>Grandeur</hi> of the year by his being born in it.</p>
               <p>He was not of a mean or low <hi>Original,</hi> though its possible for one arising from <note place="margin">Not of a low Original.</note> such a Fountain to be <hi>Great and Worthy)</hi> but he derived his <hi>Pedigree</hi> from an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Family,</hi> containing no small number of Noble <hi>Ancestors;</hi> He was the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Third Knight, lineally desended of that Family, which still enjoys the Paternal Estate they had before the Conquest.

               <p>It is therefore necessary and becoming to shew how the Almighty <hi>honoured</hi> him <note place="margin">Divine Birth.</note> in giving him another <hi>Birth,</hi> more Noble and Great than the most losty Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ever enjoy'd; here we may say <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Time of his Conversion,</hi> it was when he was <hi>young,</hi> the Lord enabled <note place="margin">The Time of his Conversion</note> him to <hi>Remember his Creator in the days of his youth,</hi> by casting in the Seed of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi> when he was at School, the very time when others of his Rank and Quality give up themselves to the greatest degrees of <hi>licencious Wantonness,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Excesses; pretending that the <hi>heat of Nature,</hi> and strength of the <hi>lusts of Youth,</hi> produce a sufficient Apology and Discharge for the same: But at that very time did <hi>Infinite Grace</hi> so effectually seize on him, That with the devout young <hi>Abel</hi> he did offer his <hi>First-fruits</hi> unto God.

O then to be abstemious, to be crucified with Christ, to be mortified and wholly dead to all these things, is rare and glorious!</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>matter or occasion of his Humiliation;</hi> this was eminently remarkable; <note place="margin">Matter or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of his Humiliation.</note> the Lord being pleased to go out of his ordinary way or method he commonly useth in the Conviction and Humiliation of such as bear his date and character in the World, to wit, by charging upon their Consciences <hi>some notorious actual sin,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:62667:172"/> as we find by frequent experience, but yet it was otherwise with him; For living more innocently than (for the most part) young Gentlemen do, upon a time hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> opened, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5. <hi>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> From which words the <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>odiousness</hi> of <hi>Original sin</hi> being demonstrated and pressed home, it pleased the Lord so deeply to awaken and affect his Mind and Conscience thereby, as that in the whole follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing course of his Life, from that very time, it was a means to <hi>abase all high thoughts of himself,</hi> and to make him <hi>lye down at the Footstool of God in the mournful sense of his own emptiness and vileness;</hi> yea, he was more solidly and constantly humbled and broken for it, than for all the Fruits of it, which every day make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance by actual transgressions in the Lives of the most, yet by this means was happily prevented in him: For as <hi>Pliny</hi> says (in his Natural History, <hi>lib.</hi> 7.) <hi>That they that are once stung with Scorpions, are ever after priviledged from being stung with Wasps and Hornets,</hi> so he that is first deeply humbled for this <hi>Root, Mother,</hi> and <hi>Nurse</hi> of all Wickedness and Corruptions (to wit, <hi>Original sin)</hi> shall seldom have cause afterward to be wounded with the <hi>guilt of Actual transgressions;</hi> this was well confirmed by the following Life of this <hi>holy Youth.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Foundation of his Faith,</hi> it was more to be observed, or taken special notice of than the rest; for whereas the greatest number of Men <hi>ground their Faith</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Foundation of his Faith.</note> upon that which can only be the <hi>Proof of it,</hi> that is, <hi>the evidences of their love to God;</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> having learned better things, ground it <hi>upon the discovery of the all sufficiency of Christs merit, revealed in the Gospel;</hi> and a third sort lay the ground of their Faith <hi>upon the general offer of God in the Gospel, tendering Christ to them;</hi> His Faith was not only built <hi>generally</hi> upon the <hi>Evidences of Gods love to sinners,</hi> but <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi> upon the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as it is <hi>the Law of Faith,</hi> held forth unto him in the first Epistle of St. <hi>John</hi> 3. chap. ver. 23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we should believe on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> From which place was very happily urged by him that then Preached, <hi>That in the Gospel there was not only granted a liberty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ, if we pleased, but a necessity imposed, that requireth us to believe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or no.</hi> It pleased the Lord by this Doctrine so to prevail with, and overpower his Heart by the Authority of this Precept, that he <hi>durst not refuse it,</hi> but <hi>submitted unto it;</hi> and so his <hi>confidence,</hi> or <hi>foundation</hi> of his Faith, was exercised in <hi>pure obedience</hi> unto God. Which, being the most Evangelical and sublime re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Christ; namely, upon no other ground but the <hi>authoritative Will</hi> of God, was that which produced this <hi>honourable second Birth</hi> in him; wherein his Faith was more established, than it usually is in most Believers through all the days of their Lives.</p>
               <p>Now we have shewed you the <hi>Birth</hi> of this Great Man <hi>Divine</hi> as well as <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi> you cannot but say, That as he was <hi>Genere nobilis,</hi> so he was <hi>Sanctitate nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior:</hi> Great by his <hi>Natural Birth,</hi> but greater by that which was <hi>Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> concerning his <hi>Life;</hi> which we shall find was as <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>gracious,</hi> as <note place="margin">His Life.</note> his <hi>Birth</hi> was <hi>raised</hi> and <hi>remarkable,</hi> if we compare those exact <hi>Descriptions</hi> we find of such a <hi>Life</hi> in the holy Text with the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of this holy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. Whether we draw the Description of his Life from what the <hi>Psalmist</hi> lays down, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 1. <hi>Blessed are the undefiled in the way, which walk in the Law of the Lord.</hi> Or, from what <hi>Zacharias</hi> doth propose, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74, 75. <hi>Serving God in Holiness and Righteousness all the days of our Lives.</hi> Or, lastly, from what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did practice, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 16. <hi>Exercising himself to have always a Conscience void of offence towards God, and towards Men.</hi> We shall find, I say, his <hi>Life</hi> to be a <hi>Copy</hi> or <hi>Counterpane</hi> of all these, and so to be very <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>gracious;</hi> and this we must draw from the whole of what is to be said under this General Head.</p>
               <p>For the illustrating this, I shall set before you Four Particulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>His Personal Capacity as a Man, including part of his constitutive Character.</hi>

                  <item>2. <hi>His publick Capacity, as a Magistrate or States-man.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>His Relative Capacity, belonging to his Family.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>His Religious Capacity, belonging to God and the Church.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For his Personal Capacity, as a Man,</hi> including <hi>part of his constitutive Character.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Personal capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as a man.</note> And here take him in the <hi>composition</hi> of his <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> (say it was distinct from the stiperaddition of renewing perfecting Grace) and you shall see he was <hi>lovely;</hi> yea, so lovely, as to invite and please the observation of the Great and Wise. <hi>The make of his Body, even from Head to Foot</hi> (not to be too particular) <hi>was competently</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62667:173"/>
                  <hi>Gentile and Brave; His Soul was Comprehensive, Vigorous, Noble, Great and Active; His Presence and Aspect smooth and pleasant, yet Grave, and often striking Reverence and Awe into the minds and deportment of such as looked upon him;</hi> especially, <hi>such as came before him when he was exercising the Office of a Magistrate.</hi> I may say of his, as was said of <hi>Basils</hi> Countenance, whilst he was performing holy Exercises, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That so much Divine Majesty and Lustre appeared therein, that it made the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> Valens <hi>tremble to behold it.</hi> And in like manner this most exact and holy Gentlemans <hi>severe deportment</hi> was so effectual, that it banished from his <hi>presence</hi> all those scurrilous and sordid Gestures and Practices, which the debauchery and impudence of too many of considerable Degree fear not to act in the sight of God and their Betters. This will be further confirmed, if we do but recite four Lines of a large <hi>Elegie</hi> upon his Death, writ by a knowing impartial Hand; thus,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Shall I not once again on Earth behold</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Countenance so grave, so brave, so bold,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Which <hi>with a look</hi> could daunt the face of sin,</l>
                  <l>And make offence <hi>to hide it self within.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <p>As there were none more flexible and complying than himself to the most <hi>easie desires</hi> of those who were just, honest, and good, be they of the lowest Rank of men in the World; so on the other side, there was none could put on a <hi>braver obstinacy,</hi> or move <hi>peremptory refusal,</hi> than he would do, to the most lofty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or most zealous Importunities, even of the greatest Men, if what was urged was <hi>unjust,</hi> or against his happy Rule of Life, the <hi>Word of God.</hi> This was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of what was said by another, of those many <hi>excellent Persons</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doled his Death, and justly adorned his Person and Memory by their Elegies; as follows,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Most</hi> perfect Image <hi>of the</hi> God <hi>above,</hi>

                     <hi>Not</hi> driven <hi>by</hi> violence <hi>or</hi> base command.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>It was said at his Funeral, <hi>That there was in him a blessed conjunction of those things which rarely meet in any other,</hi> to wit, <hi>an admirable facility and easiness to be intreated,</hi> with a great yieldingness of Spirit, even to Inferiours, when any good might be done thereby: and yet also <hi>a strong, resolute, unmoveableness and stedfastness of mind in opposing all evil in whomsoever:</hi> so that he was truly what was reported of <hi>Athanasius, Magnes &amp; Adamas,</hi> a <hi>Loadstone</hi> for his sweetness in drawing on that which was <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and an <hi>Adamant</hi> for his Courage and Stoutness in suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Evil.</hi> In regard of the former, I may say as was said of <hi>Titus,</hi> the Emperour, that he was <hi>Deliciae humani generis,</hi> the delights of mankind; and in respect of the latter, he was <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> a true <hi>Israelite</hi> without guile.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For his publick Capacity, as a Magistrate or States-man.</hi> So, <note place="margin">Publick capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. Justice of the Peace.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As he was <hi>Justice of the Peace,</hi> he was exceeding active and useful; he ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised <hi>Justice</hi> in its own due time and way; he never befriended the <hi>Great</hi> to the prejudice of those that were <hi>little</hi> and <hi>mean</hi> in the World; he ever held the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of <hi>Justice</hi> in an even hand, and acted as impartially, as if all that came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him had neither had Interest in him, nor any Acquaintance at all; he was only <hi>a terrour to evil doers, but a praise and encouragement to all them that did well;</hi> by this means making <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> grow round about him.</p>
               <p>When he was <hi>High-Sheriff,</hi> (which he was in the One and twentieth year of the <note place="margin">High Sheriff.</note> Reign of King <hi>James)</hi> he was to God, his King, and the Country for which he served, one of the most exact that ever bore that Office. One passage here I must not let slip; As serving of God was one principal business in every place he was employed in through his Life; so here, though he neglected no business that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his present Office, yet he had a special care to have God faithfully ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that even in the Week-day, <hi>taking with him his Sheriffs-men to a Weekly Lecture at some distance from his House;</hi> thereby dignifying that Office at an higher rate than usually, if not at any time, is performed.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62667:173"/>
               <p> He was also usually placed in the high Trust of a <hi>Parliament-man;</hi> for he was <note place="margin">Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> constantly chosen on every occasion as a <hi>Knight</hi> for his own Native County; not, that he had a Patent for the place, as some of his Enemies did report, out of envy at the Peoples honouring him by their constant Election, but because he was ever found to have a noble <hi>Resolution and Care to discharge the Trust that was committed to him;</hi> whereby it came to pass that no sooner was one to be chosen, who should be intrusted with a power over the Lives and Estates of his Country, but presently the <hi>thoughts, eyes</hi> and <hi>resolutions</hi> of all Men were fixed upon him, and all cryed for a <hi>Barnardiston, a Barnardiston.</hi> Which Trust he received upon him, not out of any <hi>Popular ambition,</hi> to advance his own greatness; nor, out of any self-end to <hi>raise his own Estate,</hi> by exhausting the publick Treasury, or to enrich himself by other mens ruine; nor out of <hi>lofty arrogancy</hi> that he might <hi>domineer and trample</hi> upon his <hi>Neighbours</hi> in the Country, under pretence of the Priviledge of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-man; much less to abuse that Peace to an <hi>impurity,</hi> and sheltering of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in <hi>Riot, Excess, Pride</hi> and <hi>Lasciviousness;</hi> but out of a Mind and Conscience devoted to the Service of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> beyond which neither <hi>fear, favour,</hi> nor <hi>flattery</hi> could draw him to Act or Vote at all, absolutely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to defile himself by any miscarriage, let the inducement or temptation be what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
               <p>Now consider him as a <hi>publick Person,</hi> and was he not <hi>Pater Patriae, a true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Countrey?</hi> which Title he did as certainly deserve as ever did <hi>Curtius, Claudius,</hi> or the <hi>Decij;</hi> for although he did not in every particular what is said of them, <hi>Pro toto terrarum orbe se devovere,</hi> devote himself for the defence of the whole Earth; yet for his Countrey and the defence of the just Rights and Liberties thereof, he did not refuse voluntarily to expose himself to a <hi>Gulph of hazards and sufferings;</hi> witness his suffering under the Imposition of Ship-money, Coat and Conduct-money, and the Loan; for refusing whereof he was a long time impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned in the <hi>Gate-house,</hi> and afterward confined for a longer time in <hi>Lincoln-shire,</hi> above sixscore miles from his own usual abode.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For his Relative capacity, belonging to his Family.</hi> Here he was really what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <note place="margin">Relative capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city belonging to his Family.</note> a good and holy Man. And here we'l consider him in his carriage and acting both as <hi>Inferiour,</hi> and <hi>Superiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As an <hi>Inferiour</hi> towards his <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Grandfather;</hi> where he did in every <note place="margin">As Inferiour.</note> thing answer that Relation he stood in to them. So that you will see he knew as <note place="margin">A Son.</note> well how to <hi>honour, serve</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> as to <hi>command, cherish</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> He enjoy'd his <hi>Father</hi> a less time than his <hi>Grandfather,</hi> his <hi>Father</hi> being removed by Death long before his <hi>Grandfather;</hi> but yet we may easily gather what his carriage to him was, from the high and extensive value he set upon his Memory; as, he used to please himself to discourse of his <hi>Father,</hi> affirming that he was a very <hi>godly</hi> Man, and that it was a <hi>great disadvantage</hi> for him to part with him so young; these things, and others, he would often declare to his Children and Friends, dropping many Tears, to shew his great and strong Affection; and when he made his Will, he there exprest an importunate desire to his Executors that the <hi>Bones</hi> of his <hi>Father</hi> might be digged out of the Earth, (where they were buried) and laid by his own Body in a new Vault, he ordered his Executors to erect for the same purpose; thus, though he could not <hi>live</hi> with his Father as long as he would have desired, yet he designed that their Bodies or Relicks, should lye together till the happy Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection day; which certainly did denote a <hi>noble Veneration,</hi> and a most raised <hi>Filial Affection.</hi> As to his <hi>Grandfather,</hi> he always behaved himself in all suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">A Grandson.</note> to his <hi>Relation;</hi> Two things here we may record, as <hi>First,</hi> how the <hi>Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> when young was educated under the Great Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in <hi>Geneva,</hi> being sent thither by his Guardians in the miserable and most unhappy days of our Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and this we can say, that if the <hi>Grandfather</hi> failed to live according to that Education in some part of his Life, yet his <hi>Grandson</hi> endeavoured to live it for him; which he not only did in an eminent Degree, but for that reason also; looking upon the Goodness of God, in extraordinary Mercies or Providences to <hi>Progenitors,</hi> to be obliging to <hi>Posterity,</hi> so as to invite to a good Improvement, as the best way of <hi>thankfulness,</hi> the best way of preventing the Divine <hi>displeasure,</hi> and the best way of <hi>reconciliation</hi> to God, and true <hi>advantage</hi> to a Mans own Soul. Again, <hi>Secondly,</hi> There was another thing fit to be recorded, to wit, <hi>his constant importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Grandfather,</hi> upon every vacancy of Church Livings, <hi>to give him leave to</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:62667:174"/>
                  <hi>Present,</hi> because he was likely, according to the common course of Nature, to have the longest enjoyment of such men; which, his <hi>Grandfather</hi> submitting to, was the occasion of eminent and worthy Divines being put into such Livings as became void, there being many belonging to that Family. This was much to the credit of his Grandfather, more to his own comfort and joy, and most of all to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity and happiness of such Towns and Parishes as this Blessing fell upon. All the days of his <hi>Grandfathers</hi> Life he was ever endeavouring to do him good, and help him in any of his Affairs, all which he did with great Humility, Respect, and Honour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As a <hi>Superiour;</hi> and here his Relation honoured the Degree of an <hi>Husband,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">As Superiour.</note> a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Grandfather,</hi> and a <hi>Master;</hi> in all which he appeared and acted in an eminent way. As,</p>
               <p>An <hi>Husband;</hi> he seemed here to imitate the practice of the <hi>Lord Jesus towards</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Husband.</note>
                  <hi>his Church,</hi> in his conjugal love, protection, and full contentation and delight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he became a Pattern and Mirrour of Matrimonial <hi>sweetness and faithfulness:</hi> and as it is said by one of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> concerning <hi>Methuselahs</hi> Wife, <hi>That she had nine Husbands in one,</hi> for age and years; so I may say of this Gentlemans Lady, that she had nine Husbands in him alone, <hi>for his amiable Carriage and Graces.</hi> These were, it is true, acted while he was Living, but he left a Testimonial in his <hi>Will</hi> of his <hi>living</hi> Affection after his own <hi>death,</hi> over and above the <hi>Marriage Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> to shew his endearedness of her, by his affectionate remembrance when he himself was gone.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Father</hi> he was also; and what manner of one his <hi>Children</hi> have declared in <note place="margin">As a Father.</note> their <hi>hearts, lives,</hi> and <hi>filial deportments;</hi> they have always affirmed that he ever performed not only the part of an <hi>earthly Father,</hi> in the due discovery of all <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming bowels</hi> and <hi>tender affection</hi> to their Bodies, but also performed the Office of an <hi>heavenly Father</hi> to their Souls, by a <hi>constant endeavour</hi> and <hi>serious study</hi> for their Education in the most exact and strict way of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>paternal</hi> Religion; one te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonial of which was his continual bestowing on them <hi>spiritual</hi> Counsels and <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> Instructions, the grand scope and end of which was to incite and stir them up to a <hi>strict watchfulness over themselves,</hi> and a <hi>close walking with God;</hi> and it was usual with him, after the giving such Instructions unto them severally, to take them into his Closer, and there pray over them and for them. If at any time they had displeased him, so excellent was his moderation and wisdom towards them, that he would never <hi>correct</hi> them, nay, not so much as <hi>reprove</hi> them in his <hi>displeasure,</hi> but still waited the most cool and convenient time, wherein they seldom disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that he was angry, by any other effect <hi>but his silence.</hi> And, on the other side, he was so ready to encourage them in any Acts of well doing, that for the most part his extraordinary <hi>respects</hi> and <hi>favours</hi> towards them, were bestowed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the notion of rewards of their Duty, than the issues of his Bounty; still <hi>professing before them</hi> (as he usually did to his Friends upon their discoursing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the extraordinary Blessings of God upon them in their Travels abroad, and their Returns home again) <hi>that he took infinitely more content in beholding one grain of Grace, and evidence of true Regeneration in his Children, than if their Estates and Gains abroad had been multiplied an hundred fold;</hi> if withall they had come back again prophane, or no more than meerly Civilized, without the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.—He was ever a <hi>kind and dear Father</hi> for <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Wishes,</hi> for <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Prayers;</hi> and for <hi>numerous Letters</hi> constantly sent to his Children; many of which, being very excellent, might have been inserted for the good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of others, only they would have swell'd his Life beyond what is thought convenient.—Though he was ever importunate to have all his Sons em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, not taking it as becoming to have any of his live out of useful Callings; whereby they might bless and better their Generation, yet he ever desired rather to have them <hi>good</hi> than <hi>great.—</hi>In his Will he exhorts them all <hi>to fear God,</hi> and <hi>love one another; and that, if any difference happened amongst them, as ever they bore any duty or love to him, or as they would expect the like from their own Children, they would leave all such differences to the Arbitrement of the rest of their Brethren, and would stand to their Award.—</hi>In the said Will he also leaves Ten Pounds to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mr. <hi>Fairclough,</hi> his Parochial Minister, with this desire, <hi>That whilst he lived he would give good Advice and Counsel to his Children.</hi> Thus you see he was a most dear, most affectionate, and most Religious Father. You shall also see more of this, when we come to speak of his Death.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:62667:174"/>
               <p> He was also a wise and careful <hi>Grandfather,</hi> not only instructing these little <note place="margin">As a Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> sweet Relations while he lived, but also using endeavours to command them to be <hi>good, honest,</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> when he was dead; as appears by what he lest under his Hand in his last Will, so often mentioned, where he bequeaths them several Legacies, but with this <hi>Proviso, That if any of them would not be ruled by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, it should be in the power of their Parents to lessen or take away what he had left them, first giving it under their Hands to his Executors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was also an excellent Master to his Servants; giving them all that was just, due, and necessary for their maintenance and encouragement. He ever gave them <note place="margin">As a Master.</note> good Example in himself, and failed not to instruct them in the most useful things for the benefit of their Souls and Bodies. <hi>As he walked within his house with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Heart, so he hated the work of them that did turn aside; and did not permit any prophane person to stand before him, or to wait upon him; his eyes were ever fixed upon those that were faithful in the Land, that they might serve him,</hi> Psal. 101. This was the reason that he had so many excellent Servants; his Family being a true Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery for the qualifying and accomplishing such; so that one, who was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Family, affirms, <hi>that at one time he had ten or more Servants</hi> so eminent for Piety and Sincerity, that he never saw the like, all at once, in any Family in the Nation; such, whose Obedience, joyned to their Governours care, produced so rare an effect, that they truly made his House a <hi>spiritual Church and Temple,</hi> wherein were daily offered up the spiritual Sacrifices of <hi>Reading the Word,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> Morning and Evening, of <hi>singing of Psalms</hi> constantly after every Meal, before any Servant did rise from the Table: also the chiefest of them did usually, after every Sermon they heard, call the rest into the Buttery, (a place of most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in other Houses) and there repeat the Sermon unto the rest, before they were called to the repetition of it in their Masters presence.</p>
               <p>By this time you may easily see how excellent this Gentleman was at Relative Duties; he was not a Saint abroad, and a Devil at home, as is but too truly said of some that make no small show in Religion, but he was a Saint in all places and Relations; which will appear by what follows.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are to consider him in his <hi>Religious Capacity, belonging to God and the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Religious Capacity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to God and the Church.</note>
                  <hi>Church:</hi> In which he was no less excellent than in any of those that went before.</p>
               <p>Here we may <hi>(first)</hi> see with how much Piety ond Devotion <hi>he exercised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self towards God;</hi> he ever lived and acted with such a <hi>reverential Awe,</hi> and most <hi>devout respect</hi> towards the Almighty, that his Life seemed little else but one entire <note place="margin">Belonging to God.</note>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies</hi> of Devotion. Yet we will a little see what he was in particular Duties of Religion; and here whether we instance in secret or publick Exercises, <hi>he did so earnestly devote himself unto them, that for my part</hi> (saith a Godly Divine that was his close Observer) amongst Persons of his Quality, <hi>I think he hath left very few Superiours behind him, if any Equals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In Private Duties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's recorded to the everlasting praise of the young Lord <hi>Harrington,</hi> so famous for Piety, that it was his constant use to Pray twice every day in secret, twice with <note place="margin">Private Duties</note> some choice Friends and Servants, besides his Family Duties. But I am assured, by those that closely observed this gracious Knight, that it was his practice to pour out his Soul before the Lord in secret thrice every day, and sometimes oftner, if he could gain opportunity; besides his Family Duties, and days of extraordinary Humiliation, which he importunately embraced upon every occasion. This I can testifie (saith Mr. <hi>Fairclough)</hi> upon mine own experience, that for many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether when I was first acquainted with him, I seldom visited him or he me, but if any convenient place could be found, <hi>we might not part except we had prayed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.—</hi>Nor was he more frequent in secret Prayer, than constant in secret reading the Scriptures; which he ever made sure work to begin and close up with Prayer, that he might obtain the blessing of God thereon: afterward he ever read other choice Authors, of which he had store; but not long before his Death he took singular delight to read Mr. <hi>Baxters Saints Everlasting Rest,</hi> and Preparation thereunto; which after his death was taken notice of to be nothing else but <hi>the gracious event of the Divine Providence,</hi> sending it as a Guide to bring him more speedily and directly to that Rest.—His constant converse with single Persons, was so Divine, as to merit a place among his private Duties unto God; for his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62667:175"/> Speech was ever free from the least unsavouriness, boasting, or passion; consisting of nothing but love, sweetness and modesty; all his Discourse ever <hi>ministred Grace unto the Hearers,</hi> it was ever a pure Stream from the pure Fountain of his Heart; so far from the least appearance of lightness, or excessive Mirth, that in Thirty years together none ever heard one syllable from his mouth tending to any wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton expression, that might offend the most chast Mind or Ear; but as the Poet affirmed, <hi>Vernas efflat ab ore rosas,</hi> his Tongue dropped Honey, and his Breath was as sweet and fragrant as Roses in the Spring.—Thus you see with what an industrious Holiness he used his precious time when less or more retired, so that <hi>Nunquam minus solus, quam cum solus,</hi> is a true saying of him, <hi>He was never less alone, than when alone,</hi> his God and he was most abundant company.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In Publick Duties.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Publick Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Though in private Duties, his noble Actings in or for Religion, were so much hid, as to be only like the <hi>Beams of the Sun</hi> striking under, or through a cloud; yet in his Publick Exercises unto God his Graces and Activity had their <hi>Tabernacle in the Sun,</hi> so that they did shine in a most resplendant way.</p>
               <p>If we begin with his <hi>Sanctification of the Sabbath,</hi> we shall find he addrest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thereto with so much delight, that notwithstanding he rose early every day in <note place="margin">Sanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> the Week, yet he rose more early on the Lords-day, so early, that usually he was the first up in the Family; then called his Children and others up, that they might have sufficient time to prepare themselves for a more reverent and devout attendance upon the Lord in his Publick Ordinances; and for himself he usually spent much time every Sabbath Morning, before he came to the Congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His value of, and constant attendance upon, the Ministration of the Word</hi> publickly dispensed, shewed him so <hi>eminent,</hi> and <hi>zealously concerned,</hi> and taken up therein, <note place="margin">Attendance on the Word Preached.</note> that it was difficult for any in the whole World to out-do him. What the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>James</hi> requires in a blessed Hearer, was his punctual practice, that is, <hi>He was swift to hear;</hi> he could never satisfie his own Conscience, if he was not present to joyn with the Congregation before there was one word spoken, or one Petition sent up to the Lord; his unweariedness in this course while he lived, was always visible to them of those Congregations where he resided. You'l see something more when we come to speak of his Death.—The Congregation being dismissed, the first thing which he did usually, after he came within his own Doors, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to betake himself to his Closet, <hi>to beg a blessed dew from Heaven, to water the seed sown in his Heart that day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Preparation for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper was transcendent;</hi> though <note place="margin">Preparation for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper.</note> he ever exceeded the most in diligence and reverence in other Duties of Gospel Worship, yet in his consciencious preparation for, and fruitful improvement of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> he did exceed himself; for the most part he spent all the time he could redeem in a <hi>fourth night</hi> before the Sacrament, in his Closet in <hi>reading, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and examination of his spiritual state,</hi> with other Duties of Preparation ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto; and what he practised himself in this kind, he constantly called upon others under him to do the like. We shall presently see further how eminent he was in preparing for the Sacrament, as also in advancing publick Catechising under the next Head; which is, in the <hi>(Second place)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To consider him in his Religious Capacity, belonging to the Church of God:</hi> in which <note place="margin">His Religious Capacity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church. Love to the Ministry.</note> we shall fully see his incomparable use and worth, if we seriously weigh the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His warm Love, and durable Affection to an holy Ministry.</hi> They who were faithful and godly in this Function, had not of his Quality a more <hi>faithful and hearty Friend</hi> and <hi>Well-wisher</hi> in the whole World; none so earnestly and frequently prayed for them, none so highly prized their Calling and Labours as he did; he was fully of that good mans mind, who openly professed, <hi>He had rather fall with the Ministry of</hi> England, <hi>than stand in greatest power with their Enemies.</hi> When some talked of mortal bloody times, and dark, black days a coming upon us, he replied, <hi>That those would be accounted dark black days indeed, when the Lights of the Ministry were extinguished,</hi> than the shortest Life would be accounted best. It was said at his Funeral, whosoever in the Congregation have been losers by his death, <hi>We of the Ministry have the greatest loss;</hi> if the Hearers put on blacks, the Preachers have cause to mourn in Sack-cloth.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:62667:175"/> 2. <hi>His extraordinary care and endeavours constantly to present to every Living where</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Care to make good Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>
                  <hi>he was Patron, such as were right qualified and holy Men.</hi> You may refer to this <hi>Head</hi> what was said before, in speaking to his behaviour to his Grandfather; to which I shall add, That he was not only careful in his Grandfather's time, but ten times more in his own; so that when any Place belonging to his Gift was vacant, he would spend many daies in <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> to invite the <hi>Direction</hi> of God, to guide his bestowing thereof; professing many times with all possible seriousness, <hi>That his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did more tremble to set his hand and Seal to a Presentation, than to any other Writing or Deed whatsoever;</hi> lest (said he) I should thereby bring the loss of the <hi>Peoples Souls</hi> to be required of me or my Posterity, through my negligence therein. And therefore when by all his own eare, and advice of Friends, such an one would not be procured, as for sufficiency and abilities could give satisfaction to the conscience of this rare Patron, then he left it wholly to the <hi>better sort of the People</hi> in that Place, to chuse their own Minister and Pastor. Oh how happy was all those Towns where he was Patron, for they might be sure to have fair play for their Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>His doing all he could to draw his Neighbours to the Life, Power and universal practice of Religion.</hi> This was admirable kindness to the Church: for she is little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended <note place="margin">Drawing his Neighbours to the Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> by <hi>like-warm,</hi> much less by <hi>lifeless</hi> Professors. He alwaies heartily joyned with his Minister (the fore-mentioned eminent Mr. <hi>Fairclough)</hi> in every Design that might advance holiness, and make the Church to grow; nay, engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to do all things that could be proposed for that end. I will here mention two excellent Practices of his tending directly to the design in hand; the first was about Catechizing, the other the Sacrament of the Supper of our Lord.</p>
               <p>As to Catechizing, he saw it was necessary for <hi>Old</hi> People as well as <hi>Young,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the obtaining Saving Knowledge, that he proposed it to the Heads of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in the Town and Parish of <hi>Ketton</hi> (both <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>poor)</hi> That when the Children or Servants were Catechized, if they could not give Answer at any time to the Question asked, the Father or Master should answer for them; he engaging that he would do the like for his Children and Servants; he, having laid out some time and several importunate Arguments, did preyall to the setting up of this practice, which by his Example succeeded well; which, through the grace of God, was of admirable Advantage to the informing of ignorant Minds, and the building up them and others in the most holy Faith.</p>
               <p>In the next place, as to the Sacrament of the Supper of our Lord; here he did all he could to assist the Minister in hindering the openly wicked from participating of this holy Ordinance, to their own great disadvantage, as also the scandal of the Church; in order hereunto he agreed with the rest of those that were to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, <hi>That publickly he and they should declare their owning of the Baptismal Covenant;</hi> accordingly this gracious Knight did himself begin this holy undertaking, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Communicants did declare <hi>his Faith in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and did undertake, through the assistance of the Holy Spirit, to perform whatsoever his Sureties had promised in his Baptism upon his account;</hi> in which he was imitated by all others that did communicate; which did silence and keep the visibly Profane from medling with that sacred Justification and Action, they being fully convinced of the reasonableness of the practice. This surely was doing what he could to advance the <hi>Life, Power</hi> and <hi>Ʋniversal Practice</hi> of Religion among his Neighbours? and I am sure it was advantageous to the Church. But so was also,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>His constant commemorating and rejoycing in the Deliverances of the Church.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his practice was herein universal, and did contain his abundant joy in the <hi>success</hi> and <hi>deliverances</hi> of the Churches abroad, in any part of the World; yet we shall consine his Actings to our own Church in this Nation, and tell you that he did Annually commemorate and solemnize <hi>The thrice happy Day of Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration,</hi> her entrance upon the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to the glorious rescuing of the Reformed Religion, from the bloody designs of the inhumane Papists. He also did every year observe and celebrate the <hi>Fifth of November,</hi> with all becoming expressions of Joy, from the wonderful deliverance from the <hi>Gun Powder Treason,</hi> a Treason as black as Hell it self, attempting the utter destruction of our King, Prince, Nobles, principal Church-men, and all the Leading States-men of <hi>England,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the change of our Religion and ruine of our Church. But because the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> many of them to this day, like the Whore in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> wipe off this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their sin and shame, saying, There was no such thing; notwithstanding
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62667:176"/> the finding their cruel Preparations, owned and vindicated by the desparate Traitors, with many other undeniable circumstances; I shall add one farther confirmation of their undoubted guilt, often affirmed and mentioned by this excellent <hi>Knight,</hi> not a little adding to the confutation of these lying <hi>Pseudo-Christians,</hi> to wit, That a day or two before the perfect Discovery of this Horrid Plot, (which was when <hi>Faux</hi> was apprehended) he being for some considerable time in the <hi>Temple</hi> Garden, where he was then a <hi>Student,</hi> did observe <hi>several men walking there together, and constantly whispering, looking and acting much concerned,</hi> all of whom within a few daies after he found to be those bloody Conspirators, by going to view them in Prison. Well, on these daies, (I say) of our Churches Deliverance, he did annually express all becoming joy and thankfulness, by Divine Praises, and other usual civil waies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing. See <hi>Esther</hi> 9. 22, 26, 27, 28.</p>
               <p>Thus I have shewed you something, and but something, of what this <hi>Holy Man</hi> was in his Religious capacity towards God and the Church. I have, I confess, but mentioned (as I say) <hi>something</hi> of his <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Excellencies,</hi> for divers are omitted wherein he was as eminent as in any I have named. It's necessary indeed that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in one, I mean, <hi>his Charity to the Poor,</hi> in which he did <hi>Cloath</hi> and <hi>Feed</hi> great number of those that dwelt round about him constantly year by year while he lived, and left them Legacys in <hi>several Parishes</hi> when he dyed; yea, so <hi>extensive was his Heart in the practice of Charity,</hi> that it reached even as far as the <hi>Poor</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> whose necessities he did highly commiserate and supply.</p>
               <p>But thus much for his <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And lastly for <hi>His Death:</hi> and surely if their Death be blessed, <hi>That</hi> (with <note place="margin">His Death.</note> St. <hi>Paul) have finished their Course, and kept the Faith: That</hi> (with good old <hi>Simeon) have beheld the Salvation of Christ;</hi> or that <hi>rest from their labours, their Works follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them?</hi> then it will appear that his <hi>Death</hi> was as <hi>blessed,</hi> as his <hi>Life</hi> was <hi>gracious,</hi> and his <hi>Birth Honourable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we shall find six Things remarkable. 1. His <hi>Preparation</hi> for it at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. 2. His <hi>welcoming</hi> the <hi>Messenger</hi> thereof when it drew near. 3. His <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness,</hi> even then to <hi>be absent</hi> from holy Ordinances and Exercises. 4. His most <hi>fervent performance</hi> of such <hi>Duties</hi> as he was <hi>capable of.</hi> 5. His <hi>excellent</hi> farewel <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> to his Children. 6. His <hi>peaceable</hi> and joyful <hi>Departure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His Preparation for Death at some distance.</hi> He was unwilling to be surprized, and therefore did use endeavours for several years before it came to be ready, but <note place="margin">His Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Death.</note> especially for two years before he was, ever thinking of it and fitting for it: then he made his last Will and Testament, and writ it with his own Hand, upon this very ground (as he there expresseth) that after he had so disposed his Affairs, and set his House in order, he might have nothing in the World to <hi>look after,</hi> or to <hi>look upon,</hi> but his blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>Salvation by him.</hi> In which last Testament, he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers so much <hi>Assurance,</hi> and confidence, of the Lord's everlasting <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>love</hi> unto him, as if at the same time, like the fore mentioned <hi>Simeon,</hi> he had <hi>embraced the Lord Jesus in his Arms.</hi> As in the beginning of his Will he heartily begs the guidance of God to direct him in the wise disposal of what Divine Goodness had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him, so in several other places he doth <hi>annex</hi> and <hi>twist</hi> in so many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Counsels</hi> and precious <hi>Instructions,</hi> tending to the everlasting Inheritance of his Posterity, that it rather resembles our <hi>Saviours Testament,</hi> conveighing the Legacys of the Covenant of Grace, or an heavenly Sermon, then any political Instrument to dispence only earthly Possessions. It was observed of him, That after his <hi>Will</hi> was finished, he seemed to have little to do, but to be gone to the better World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much at ease and rest, as if he had indeed wholly done with this World, in which he continued (as is said) about two years after, but alwaies acted at the same rate of willingness and readiness to be gone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His welcoming the Messenger of Death, when it drew near.</hi> He did not then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">His welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of Death.</note> to the usual method of most, seem shy and averse to be gone, as if so be he were <hi>not ready,</hi> but was <hi>heartily ready;</hi> for as soon as ever there appeared on his side a small swelling, in which none but himself conceived any danger, he being then at <hi>Hackney,</hi> did send Fifty Miles for Mr. <hi>Fairclough,</hi> his Minister, to discourse him, and taking him to walk with him, presently fell into conference of <hi>the worth and immortality of the soul, of the manner of its Subsistence and actings, when it was separated, of the Joyes of the other World, and the vanity and emptiness of all things in this</hi> as being most suitable to his present condition; and herewith he was so deeply
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62667:176"/> and spiritually affected, that at their parting he exprest himself in the following manner to Mr. <hi>Fairclough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, <hi>I now much wonder that any man, that fully believes these things to be realities, and not meer notions (being in my condition) should be unwilling to dye; for my own part, I will not be so flattered, with any carnal content, as to be desirous to live longer in this World, where there is little hope left that the Lord hath any more work or service for me to do, except it be to suffer for keeping a good Conscience, in witnessing against the Apostacys and impieties of the Times;</hi> and now it is a great <hi>favour of God to be sent for speedily.</hi> After this, he being removed to <hi>London,</hi> for greater conveniency of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, he there made the same profession, <hi>Of his desire to be desolved and be with Christ,</hi> unto several Friends, and Visiters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>His unwillingness even then, to be absent from holy Ordinances and Exercises.</hi> His pains and weakness growing so fast upon him that he was thereby hindered the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, <note place="margin">His unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to neglect Ordinances.</note> first of <hi>publick Ordinances,</hi> in the Church, and presently after sometimes of those that were <hi>private</hi> in the Family; which was the greatest grief that burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Mind, as you shall see in what follows—One Sabbath morning observing the People of the Family, where he lodged, getting themselves ready to joyn with the Congregation belonging to that Place, <hi>He fell into a great passion of sorrow, and wept very much,</hi> and with <hi>David, Poured out his Heart,</hi> because he had <hi>gone with the multitude, and led them to the House of God,</hi> but now was necessitated to want the benefit of that, which his <hi>Soul so much thirsted after.—</hi>Again, The Week before he died, he was perswaded in respect of the extremity of his pain once or twice to go to bed before <hi>Family Prayers;</hi> but the night following, being again perswaded to it, he told them <hi>he would not be intreated to do so any more,</hi> for he said, <hi>He was sure that he slept the worse those nights for the want of it,</hi> spiritually using the Proverb, <hi>Whet is no Let.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>His most fervent performance of such holy Duties, as he was capable of.</hi> Because <note place="margin">His perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all Duties as he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> able.</note> he could not enjoy those that were <hi>Publick,</hi> as I have said, he therefore gave up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so much the more earnestly to the exercise of <hi>secret reading</hi> the Scripture, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and Prayer, so long as his strength would hold out; <hi>but one Wave followed another so fast,</hi> that he was disabled thereby to be so frequent and constant in those secret Duties of communion with the Lord as he desired; for which he made many complaints to his Sons, and others, as they came about him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>His excellent Advice to his Children.</hi> The day before his Death, his Children <note place="margin">His advice to his Children.</note> being about him, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> were, after he had blessed them all, and put up his Prayers to Heaven for them, and gave them his last Advice and Counsel; in four Particulars. <hi>First,</hi> He admonished them <hi>to take heed of Worldliness and vain glory.</hi> Shewing what a vast difference there was between a <hi>gracious, humble</hi> Man, and a <hi>proud graceless</hi> Man, both in the estimation of God, and all men that were good and wise. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He perswaded them <hi>to live in love and unity together;</hi> yet so as they should ever count it their Duty to wrath over one another, and never be afraid to tell one another of their faults lovingly, and not be <hi>Mealy-mouth'd,</hi> as his expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they should <hi>take heed of timorousness, and sinking from the Truth,</hi> by reason of the oppositions of the Times against the Scripture-power of Godliness, shewing the danger of complying with man against God. <hi>Fourthly, He commended them unto the Word of Gods Grace, and the Word of Grace unto them:</hi> Requiring them to be constant in reading the Scriptures, and to joyn Prayer thereto, for a blessing before and after.</p>
               <p>After these Counsels, one of his <hi>Sons</hi> (telling him, how much he hoped the words of a dying Father would be regarded by them) desired him to deal impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially with each of them, and discover unto them what <hi>Evils</hi> he had noted each of them most prone unto, and what Duties he had observed any of them most negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in; he did perform what was desired with so much plainness, that one of his <hi>Brothers</hi> standing by, desired him to use the same fidelity to him, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he did: A piece of <hi>Affection</hi> rarely found expressed with wisdom.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>His peaceable and joyful departure out of the World.</hi> He enjoyed just before his <note place="margin">His peaceable and joyful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</note> death, and even to the last, such an abundant <hi>Peace</hi> and ravishing <hi>Joy,</hi> as could not be hid, his <hi>Soul</hi> being so filled therewith, that it even overflowed, and poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all those that enquired after his condition. This appeared, <hi>First,</hi> to his second Son, who observing him to grow faint, did desire him to be chearful; to whom he answered, <hi>Son, I thank the Lord, I am so chearful in my heart, that I could laugh</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:62667:177"/>
                  <hi>whilst my sides Ake.—</hi>Then to his <hi>Brother</hi> at the same time, enquiring how he found himself, he answered much to the same purpose, saying, <hi>O Brother, blessed be God, I have abundance of ravishing joy within me.</hi> The same answer he gave to his <hi>Eldest Son,</hi> who being called to him, he enquiring of his Father, <hi>How it was with him?</hi> he presently fell into an earnest Prayer, <hi>That the Lord would be pleased to give him an happy deliverance out of this World, and a glorious Meeting with his Saviour.</hi> Which Prayer of his was so graciously answered, that as long as he enjoyed any use of Speech, he <hi>acknowledged the sence of this inward Joy;</hi> and after he had said, <hi>I have peace within, I have peace within,</hi> he spake no more, but lying for a while (as it were) in a slumber, at last he opened his eyesagain, and <hi>lifting up his hands towards Heaven, fell asleep in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you see that his department of <hi>Life</hi> was as <hi>comfortable,</hi> as his entrance into it was <hi>Honourable,</hi> or his abode in it <hi>gracious</hi> and acceptable both to God and all good men.</p>
               <p>He left the <hi>miserable,</hi> and went to the <hi>happy World,</hi> on the 25th of <hi>July,</hi> in the year 1653. when he had lived <hi>full Threescore and five years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Corps being carried down from <hi>London,</hi> was met about twenty Miles from his own House by Two hundred <hi>Persons,</hi> most of them of Quality; and his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, at <hi>Ketton</hi> on the 26th of <hi>August</hi> following, was attended by many <hi>Thousands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When his Body was just going to be Interred, it was said of him, by one equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>impartial</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> who knew him much better than other men, <hi>That his Life had been so free and pure from any scandalous sin, or any other actual Evil course, that for thirty years together, he did not remember, that ever he knew him soiled with any spot, which might give occasion to any to suspect his eminent integrity and sincerity, but his heart was yet upright before God;</hi> a thing very rare to betaken notice of in this World.</p>
               <p>The observation of his admirable holy Life (to all that were intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with him) rendred him, <hi>The Beauty of Grace, and Glory of Christianity,</hi> as was once said of a <hi>German Divine.</hi> His <hi>gracious Accomplishments and Practices,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing numerous and more illustrious <hi>than all</hi> other Ornaments, presented him <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> to <hi>all</hi> men <hi>while he lived,</hi> and <hi>being Dead</hi> (as so many redulent Flowers stuck upon his Hearse) did give such a pleasant and odoriferous perfume in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils of all <hi>Spectators,</hi> that the memory of them surely will ever remain among all future Generations, who shall have the advantage to understand, how the Lord was pleased to <hi>dignifie</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> him, first, with a <hi>Spiritual Birth;</hi> and <hi>after with a Gracious Life;</hi> and last of all, <hi>with a most blessed Death;</hi> for of these we may truly say, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> says of <hi>Constantine, Faelix Nativitas, felicior vita, felicissima Mors,</hi> his Birth was good, his Life better, and his Death most glorious of all.</p>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Mr.</hi> John Row, <hi>who Died, February Anno Christi,</hi> 1659/60.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IOhn Row</hi> the Son of <hi>Lawrence Row,</hi> was born in the Parish of <hi>Shobrook</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Parentage</note> in that remarkable year, 1588. And when he was an Infant, he was laid aside in his Cradle for dead: But it pleased God that one of his Sisters, having a little more courage and resolution than the rest, went to look upon him once more, and putting her <note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> hand to his mouth, she thought that she felt a little breath, whereupon, some means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presently used, he began to revive, and probably by this early and signal Providence, the Lord intimated that he had reserved him for some more than ordinary service, and this the future course of his Life did evidently shew.</p>
               <p>Being arrived to a competent Age, he was by his Parents set to School at <hi>Crediton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Education.</note> where he profited so much, both in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, that he was almost fit for the University, and had accordingly been sent thither in order to his training up for the Ministry, but that it pleased God to take away his Father a little before the intended time, concerning which himself would often say, <hi>that we frequently err in our judgments of things:</hi> And that, <hi>God sees not as men see.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being frustrate of the hopes he had of going to the University, however he would not lose that little Learning which he had got at School, only the <hi>Greek</hi> through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use was somewhat worn out with him: But he still retained the exact knowledge of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, which was of great use to him till his dying Day.</p>
               <p>He was of a sharp and pregnant Wit, of a great, deep, and penetrating Judgment: <note place="margin">His Character.</note> Himself indeed complained of some deficiency in his Memory, but others discerned it not. For they judged him to excell in that as well as in other Abilities of the mind. As for his natural temper and disposition, he was a man of great ingenuity, of much can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and sweetness: They which knew him intimately, judged him to have as noble and generous a soul, and to be as far from any thing that savoured of a base, disingenuous, and sordid Spirit, as ever any that they knew. He was exceeding Affable, and Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto all, and that without the least shew or suspition of seeking his own ends in it: His temper inclined him to be pleasing unto all, without morosity; and there was not the meanest Person which could say, that he was neglected or despised by him. He was very careful to give a due respect unto all, and never was any more curious to pay a just reverence to those that were above him in rank and quality.</p>
               <p>In his Deportment and Behaviour he was humble, sweet, and candid; as ready <note place="margin">His Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to hear others speak as to speak himself, and usually he would give others leave to speak before him. This (together with his Grace) was elevated to such an height, as that, the worst of men had not any evil to speak of him. And yet (that which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but somewhat rare to be met with) altho his natural Candor and Abilities were such, yet was he a man of great Presence and Authority. He seldom spake in any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious matter▪ but his speech carried with it a wonderful and peculiar kind of Authority: And such a Majesty shined in his Conversation, as that some (and those reputed both Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Pious) taking notice of the excellency of his Spirit, the Lustre of his Graces, and how much his conversation differed from the most of men, have professed, that when they have been in his Company, they had a kind of awe upon them, and they could not be so free, whilst they were with him, as when they were among others.</p>
               <p>When he was young, his tender Parents (according to their measure) instructed him in the grounds of Religion, and caused him, together with themselves to attend upon the publick Ordinances, by which he came first to have a taste, and relish of Religion in his heart. When his Father was dead, he went to live with Doctor <hi>Bodley</hi> (Brother to the famous Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley</hi> who was the Founder of the University Library in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford)</hi> a man of eminent Piety and Exemplary Holiness, who at this time was Minister <note place="margin">His Conversion</note> of the Parish where Mr <hi>Row</hi> was born, and where his Parents lived. From this holy man Mr. <hi>Row</hi> learned much, yea very much of the work of God upon his soul: And as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62667:179"/> he learned much from him, so he was not a little beloved of him, the Doctor bearing as tender a respect to him as if he had been his own Child.</p>
               <p>Living thus with Doctor <hi>Bodley,</hi> and afterwards, for a while with another Godly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman [Mr. <hi>Thomas Gale</hi> of <hi>Crediton]</hi> he had opportunities of frequent going to <hi>London,</hi> where he heard those Preachers as were in the greatest Repute in those times, as Doctor, <note place="margin">His Progress.</note>
                  <hi>Gouge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stock,</hi> &amp;c. and by them he was much holpen forward in spiritual knowledge and quickned in his love to the ways of God. But Doctor <hi>Bodleys</hi> Counsel, together with his holy Example (he being a man of an Austere Life, and most strict Conversation) seemed to be that which had most influence upon him, and to have the greatest impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon his Heart: For nothing was more familiar with him, through his whole Life, than to be speaking, upon all occasions, what he had seen, and heard, and observed in this worthy Doctor. The Sermons also and Preaching of Doctor <hi>Bodley</hi> was of great use to him. For this was Mr. <hi>Rowes</hi> observation concerning him, that whatever the subject were that the Doctor had been treating of, yet still, when he came to the Application, the use that he would be sure to make of it, should be to drive men to Christ.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine was so firmly rooted and rivited into Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> that all which knew him intimately, could not but say that they never knew any man that was a greater advancer of <hi>Christ,</hi> or that did more inculcate this great principle upon all whom he had occasion to coverse with, namely, <hi>That they should have a great care to deny themselves and to live upon Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More particularly what were the first gracious workings of God upon his heart, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self set down in a Paper under under his own hand, where having before related the Mercies of God towards him, and his care and providence over him in his Infancy, and Childhood, he goes on thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither did my gracious God cease to do me good in the days of my youth, whereat I may</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note>
                  <hi>justly admire: O the depth and riches of his unchangeable Grace! For here were I able to set out the true Idea of my then deformed heart and life: But better it is to confess the same to my gracious God, and to pray him not to remember those sins of my youth: Both which I have done; to wit, both confessed them and begged pardon of them, and by Gods Grace intend to do to my dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day. Yet thus much I think good to unfold, for the praise of the glory of Gods Grace, that, whereas I was by nature prone to all sins, of all kinds, especially to those two Monsters, Pride and Voluptuousness and in the latter of these an Inventer of new kinds of sinning, yet the Lord gave me not up to mine own hearts lusts altogether: But even then began, not only to restrain me, but also by the means of Grace to do me good. O Lord, my Salvation is of thee alone. For if ever any should be saved by their own Merits, very likely was it that I should be farthest off; For thou resistest the Proud. But the Gifts and Calling of God are without Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence it came to pass that the same gracious God (who out of his unchangable Love ordained me unto Life) stirred up the Spirit of Doctor</hi> Bodley <hi>to admonish me to take heed of Pride, and those overweaning conceits of my self, which he espied in me, and counselled me to buy a</hi> Bible <hi>and to read the same: which Admonition and Counsel the Lord was pleased to bless in such wise, that ever since that time, I have in some weak measure kept a constant course of reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, except some few short intermissions;</hi> By which means, I do acknowledge to the Glory of my God, that my poor soul hath received no small benefit. By this it appears that Pride and the love of Pleasure were his Master sins in the dayes of his youth; which caused him often to say in his familiar Discourse, that Ease, Pride, and Pleasure were the great sins of youth. He would also very frequently speak of this passage, that there was but one thing which he mainly desired in the days of his youth, which if it had been granted, would have proved his ruin; And that was, that he might have had the same liberty, that another young man of his acquaintance had granted unto him, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came to a miserable End. Afterwards he often acknowledged what a Mercy it was that he was so restrained by his Parents, and that God gave him not his own Will.</p>
               <p>The Lord having thus begun the good work of Grace in Mr. <hi>Rowes</hi> heart, it was <note place="margin">His Growth in Grace.</note> much improved by the Counsel, Ministry, and holy Conversation of Doctor <hi>Bodley,</hi> with whom he continued for sometime, even till the Doctors death. And the Doctor, after some experience of him, perceiving his Ingenuity, Fidelity, and Inclination to Religion, bare a very great and tender affection to him; yea, such was his love to him, that, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Child of his own, he intended to have done much for him at his Death: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing surprized with somewhat a suddain sickness, whereof he died, and not being able by reason thereof to do what he inteded, Mr. <hi>Rowes</hi> hopes were wholly frustrated of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62667:179"/> enjoying any thing that the Doctor purposed to do for him. And this Event he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon (as he was ever wont to construe it, in his familiar Discourses with his Friends) as the wise Providence of God towards him, that he might see his whole dependence to be on the Lord for what he had.</p>
               <p>About the twenty fifth year of his Age he was disposed of in Marriage, about which <note place="margin">His Marriage.</note> there were some remarkable Providences which he thought fit to Record in these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When I was desirous to enter into the state of Marriage, I was assayed with Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, Voluptuousness, and Ambition, and would surely have undone my self by some, or by all these evils, had not my gracious God, by disappointing my unsanctified desires for seven years space, or more, prevented my Folly. Oh what a misery is it for vain youth to have its will! O what a Blessing to bear the Yoke betime! Especially when God will open the Ear to discipline, as (blessed be his Name) he did mine at last. And here I may justly break out in admiration of the riches of his Grace, that brought light unto me out of my darkness, I mean, a great light of Grace into my soul, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the great darkness of mine own sin into which I fell. My Pride went before my fall; so sin drew on sin: and sin was punished with sin: Yet (O depth of Grace!) this Fall was the cause of my Rising; I mean, in Grace. Thus my Gracious God did me good by mine own evils, and made my greatest sins the occasion of my greatest humiliation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And though Voluptuousness, Ambition, and Covetousness were the Idol sins of my youth, yet my Gracious God preserved me from the gross acting of those sins, either by Murther, Adultery, Fornication, Theft, or any other unlawful way of gain: I say, that it was my gracious God that preserved me, and therefore let his Name have all the Glory. As for me, I should have run mad in Pride with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and burst asunder in Covetousness with <hi>Judas,</hi> and drowned my self in a daily course of delicacy with the <hi>Glutton</hi> that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> mentions, had I not been kept by the power of God alone. Only, only to thy Name, O Lord be the praise.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>My desire of Marriage was corrupt through Covetousness, Voluptuousness, and Ambition, as I said, and my gracious God crossing those unsanctified desires of mine for divers years, did at length teach me to desire Marriage for better Ends: And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun to set my mind in order, he also brough on the blessing. For first he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared my heart to seek him by Prayer for a meet helper, and then he opened his Ear, and granted my request; so that even in the same day wherein he had stirred me up in a more than ordinary manner to seek a blessing in my Marriage by Prayer, he was pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give me evidence that he had heard me, in sending me an honest Christian, which came to me on purpose to break the matter for Marriage with her, which afterwards God gave me to Wife.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Match Satan attempted to hinder, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y stirring up a near Friend of mine to fail in performance of his promise made to me, for my preferment, which justly might have alienated the minds of my Wives Parents from me, but that my gracious God would not suffer Satan to do me that mischief; yea, more than so, he gave me Grace to seek Reconciliation with that Friend of mine that had so deeply wronged me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Family into which he matched was godly, who rather embraced Mr. <hi>Rowes</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because of that which they had heard concerning his good Affections to Religion. She whom he took to Wife was a very godly and sincere Woman, though she walked in darkness and had no Assurance of Gods love the greatest part of her life, yet when she lay sick and was upon her death-bed, she complaining that she had no assurance of Gods love, or that when she died she should be received into glory, Mr. <hi>Row</hi> besought the Lord very earnestly for her, and the Lord was so far prevailed with, that a little before her death, he gave her assurance of being received into his heavenly Kingdom, and this in a more than ordinary manner.</p>
               <p>After Mr. <hi>Rowes</hi> Marriage he continued in his Father-in-laws house at <hi>Pinhow</hi> in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</note> four years; a place enriched with divers worldly contentments, but all imbitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of the Ministry Gods word, as himself recorded it. <q>There (saith he) I had just occasion given me to repent of my former fulsomness and weariness of that heavenly <hi>Manna.</hi> But here again my gracious God that never ceaseth to do me good, did as well provide the Plaister, as give the wound, He wounded my Conscience by want of the Ministry, thereby bringing to my remembrance my sin in undervaluing the plentiful Ministry which I once enjoyed: But he healed the breach again, not only by forgiveness and repentance, but also by providing for me the Ministry of a worthy Servant of his in a neighbouring Parish.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Row</hi> being now weary of living any longer in the house of his Father-in-Law,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62667:180"/> for the aforesaid reason, and hearing that there was an able Preacher at <hi>Crediton,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved <note place="margin">His remove to <hi>Crediton.</hi>
                  </note> his Family and habitation thither, on purpose to enjoy the means of Grace, and continued there to his dying day: And he would often exhort his Children and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that in choosing an habitation, their first care should be to plant themselves under a godly and powerful Ministry, and for this purpose adding that Text, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 8: <hi>Go forth by the Footsteps of the Flock, and feed thy Kids besides the Shepherds Tents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after his coming to <hi>Crediton,</hi> he was made <hi>High Constable,</hi> in which office he continued twenty years; in which place his care, diligence, and zeal was such, for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing and punishing of Vice, that his name became a terror to the wicked and prophane. And his prudence, charity, and compassion were not inferior to his zeal. For he used first to seek to win Offenders by good Counsel, and gentle Admonitions, before he would use the severity of the Law against them; and he had a special care to let men see that his heat was not against their Persons but against their Vices: And such was Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence <note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> with him, such the Authority and Majesty which shone in his carriage, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was forced to punish many for their misdemeanours, yet none had power so much as to lift up an hand against him. One instance is remarkable.</p>
               <p>A certain Rustian being punished by him, for some gross misdemeanours, vowed that the next time he met him he would stab him, and being put into the stocks, his rage was such, that not being able to have his Will upon Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> he struck at the stones with his Knife for very madness: Yet afterwards when he met Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> and might <note place="margin">Special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> have had opportunity to revenge himself upon him, yet the Lord so overpowred him that he was as a man struck dumb, and had not a word to say.</p>
               <p>Many of his Friends that knew his abilities, often solicited him to take the Office of a Justice of a Peace, but such was his humility and modesty, that he would by no means yield to it, saying he had neither Abilities, nor an Estate fit for it, and that it was a way <note place="margin">Humility.</note> to make Authority contemptible when Inferior persons were put into such Places. He was very circumspect to cut off all occasions of Offence from such as would be ready to take it. Being used in his younger days to shoot in the long Bow for his Recreation, once meeting with an Offender against the Law, he rebuked him for it. The man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>Why may I not as well do this as you shoot with a Bow?</hi> Upon this he laid it aside <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> and would never shoot afterwards.</p>
               <p>He was of a very peaceable temper: He would never soment differences, but sought all he could to compose them. If any jarring was between him and any others, the fault was usually theirs, because he could not comply with their corruptions, but sought their Reformation. He was a great Peace-maker, and spent much of his time in <note place="margin">A Peace-maker.</note> composing differences among neighbours and friends: Many Law Suits he prevented; many differences between near Relations he reconciled; and the Lord so blessed these his endeavours, that he was seldom free from such imployments. Upon an occasion he said to a Relation of his, that he might have encreased his Estate much more, had he spent that time in prosecuting his own affairs which he spent in the businesses, of other men. He made made other mens occasions and conditions his own; he deeply <hi>Sympathized</hi> with their distresses, and in his Prayes he would as affectionately Pray for them as for himself: And when he had undertaken their businesses, he would Act as vigorously in their behalf as if it were his own concerns, though he neither sought nor reaped any advantage to himself by it.</p>
               <p>He was Forty years old e're he attained that great blessing of Assurance; But having once obtained it he never lost it; so that he enjoyed the comfort of it for above Thirty <note place="margin">Assurance.</note> years: And as himself said, he maintained it by a diligent and constant use of all the means of Grace, both publick and private, and by taking an account of his heart, at least once every day. And that at sometimes he had more special Experience of the Witness and Testimony of the Spirit, together with that of his own; concerning which himself thus expresses it in a Letter to a Friend: In answer to your desire to receive a few of my thoughts and experiences concerning the Witness, or Testimony of the Spirit in Assurance;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I do acknowledg (to the glory of God) that God hath given me some Experience of his Love (and at sometimes more than at other times) in the Testimony of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bearing Witness with my Spirit concerning mine <hi>Adoption,</hi> and so consequently of my <hi>Justification, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> But this is better felt than expressed; yet in some measure (as the Lord shall enable me) I will endeavour to answer your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire herein. First, that there is such a priviledg given to some of Gods Elect on Earth, as to have Gods Spirit to bear Witness with their Spirits that they are the Children of God, appeareth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62667:180"/>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, that this Testimony is given to Believers after that they are effectually call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Grace, appeareth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. by which they are assured of the Grace of God: But that every one that is effectually called to Grace hath this Testimony presently given, I dare not affirm; but do rather think that some may wait a longer time than others before they do receive it. For mine own part I believe that I was effectually called divers years before the Lord gave me this Assurance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, the truth of the Testimony of this holy Spirit in mine own Soul, I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned from false flashes, and unsound comforts by this, that this Testimony doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes when it comes, raise the Soul to more desires after more intimate Union and Communion with God: Works more Self-abhorrency, and more to please God, and fear to displease him, and (in a word) drives me nearer unto God, whereas false flashes leave the Soul loose.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Again, for the continuance of this blessed Testimony in the Soul, I do find that an holy, humble, constant waiting on God and Communion with him in his Ordinances, joyned with a constant care and endeavour to walk with God, in uprightness in all the duties of my particular Calling, and Relations, are blessed means to keep up and encrease this Assurance: But the neglect, or remiss usage of these doth diminish the Oil of this blessed Lamp, and unsanctified Liberty so far grives the holy Spirit as to suspend his Testimony for a time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another asking him about the Testimony of the Spirit, he answered, <hi>It is a secret o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowering, that I am his and he is mine: I am my welbeloveds, and my welbeloved is mine.</hi> He observed that the likeliest means to attain Assurance was, to propound Spiritual ends to our selves in desiring of it; not so much that we might be quiet and free from trouble in our Consciences, but that by the knowledg and apprehension of Gods love to us, we might be able to give to God the glory of his own Grace, and be carried out to higher pitches in our obedience. For (said he) <hi>there may be much selfishness in seeking peace. I find it best when I am come to the greatest heights of Peace, to study my duty; what it is that God would have me to do, and to follow him therein: Otherwise I meet with a Cloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his accounts which he made up every day, the method that he used in his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Meditation.</note> was to consider what God had done for him, and what his carriage had been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; And he said, when he consider'd what Gods carriage towards him had been, there he saw that God had been doing him good in a constant tenor: But when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon himself, there he saw many failings: whereupon he said, there was no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction done by him that was ever so good, but there was some circumstance or other that he saw himself imperfect and defective in: And he said, <hi>I have accounted it a great pitch, when the Lord hath shewed me some defects in my best Actions that I may go clean out of my self unto Jesus Christ:</hi> By this constant practice of his in reviewing his Life and Actions, he kept much inward peace of Conscience: And usually, at the close of the day, after the casting up of his accounts and fervent Prayer, the Lord made it out out to him, that all was pardoned: And by this means at the last he attained to as an habitual a perswasion of the love of God as most have attained unto, so that he walked in the light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from day to day. Much of his Prayers were, that his faith might be so strengthened as to see and behold the love of God in all the passages of his Life, that (with <hi>Abraham)</hi> he might give the Lord glory by believing.</p>
               <p>He was very jealous of losing this blessed priviledge, namely, the sense that he had of the love of God and the light of his countenance that he walked in. He said, they were two things that he mainly desired of God: First, that having been a Professor of Religion so long, he might be kept frame scandalous sins. Secondly, That God would not hide his face from him; Saying, that he was a man of a low Spirit, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods presence he could not subsist. And therefore (said he) I saw it necessary to be kept under Affliction, that I might be humble. Knowing that God would not reveal himself to proud persons.</p>
               <p>Besides this habitual Peace and assurance, he had many particular comforts from the Lord at several times, and upon several occasions; usually when he laid him down <note place="margin">His Comforts.</note> to rest at night, he had the promise Sealed to him; <hi>Fear not—I am thy shield, and thy exceeding Great Reward.</hi> When he had been begging such a pitch of Holiness, the Lord hath hinted to him, <hi>I will satisfie thee:</hi> When the Lord took away his first Wife, whereupon he was troubled how to dispose of his Children, the Lord comforted him with this: <hi>They are thine but for a time, but they are mine for ever.</hi> Having been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62667:181"/> with a sit of the Stone, he wrote thus to a friend: <hi>These are to let you know how Fatherly the Lord dealeth with us: Tho afflicted, yet not forsaken. That which sweetens all my Afflictions is, the inward Peace which the Lord is pleased to give me in all my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pain.</hi> When he was in any special strait or difficulty, and needed Counsel what to do, the Lord did always, first or last (after his earnest seeking to him) make his way plain unto him.</p>
               <p>The Lord did also many times give him secret hints what he was about to do, <note place="margin">Discoveries of future events to him.</note> which also came to pass according to these Scriptures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 14. <hi>The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him: Gen.</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>the thing that I do?</hi> When any great thing was approaching Relating to himself, his family, or the Church, he had usually some intimations from God before-hand concerning it. On a time he was observed to be very sad, saying that God intimated to him that he would make some change in his Family, but what it would be he knew not; and he made this use of it, to set his House in order; and not long after the Lord took away a near Relation, which proved a great affliction to him. And tho the Lord did many extraordinary things, and such as were not usual or common, yet did he not expect them, neither did he (as <hi>Luther</hi> speaks of himself) indent with the Lord that he should give them unto him, much less would he boast of things of this (whereof he had many) unto others. He was content with the plain, naked word of God, which he magnified, and all his study and delight lay therein: And tho he met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extraordinary things in his own experience, yet spake he of them seldom, and but to a few; which (he said) he did, partly to prevent Spiritual pride, and partly lest weaker Christians should be discouraged, who had not attained to what the Lord had done for him; and partly that such as never knew what belonged to such things might not make a Scoff at them when they heard them.</p>
               <p>He was much in Prayer, and had a singular ability in Meditation, and this made him a wise Man, and a wise Christian, He would seldome answer any serious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Meditation.</note> but he would first pause a while. He was much delighted in a saying of Dr. <hi>Prest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That the Greatest Musers are the best Artists.</hi> He was so much taken up in Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he found himself much spent by it, and would say, <hi>That Meditation was a spending thing.</hi> Sometimes in a Morning before he rose, he would be Meditating an hour or two together: When he was riding, or walking abroad (if he was alone) he would still be in Meditation. When he went about his worldly affairs, he would contrive them before hand, and spend what spare time he had in Heavenly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: He seldom prayed in secret, but would fit himself for it by Meditation; Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he preferred a short Prayer after long Meditation, before a long Prayer without Meditation: When ever he heard a Sermon, he spent a considerable time in Meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon what he had heard.</p>
               <p>He used to say, <hi>That if he were in a place wherein he might have opportunity of hearing more than two Sermons a day, he should not like it so well to hear much, unless he could have liberty to digest it by Meditation.</hi> In Meditating upon the things he heard, he would diligently look into all the Texts that were quoted; often speaking of that famous Instance of the <hi>Bereans,</hi> of whom the Holy Ghost testifies, that they were <hi>more Noble</hi> than those of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> because <hi>they searched the Scriptures, whether those things were so.</hi> This Meditation helped him greatly, insomuch that by a diligent inquity into the Scriptures, and musing upon what he had heard, he was sometimes carried much farther than what the Minister had touched upon: And when he came to repeat those Sermons in his Family (as his constant Practice was) having Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated upon them before-hand, he would clear up those passages as had most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in them, or that had been delivered more darkly. And if the Preacher was of meaner parts and gifts, and what he had delivered might not seem so useful, he would so explain, and illustrate what he heard, that the Sermon was always ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred profitable in his Repetition of it.</p>
               <p>After his <hi>Repetition</hi> on the <hi>Lords days,</hi> he used to call his Children and Servants to an account of what they had learned of that which had been taught; If any had been careless, he would admonish and reprove them for their negligence, and shew them the danger they were in, by reason of their unprofitableness under the means of Grace: Such as were apt and forward to remember, he would commend and encourage them, often mentioning that Speech of our Saviour, <hi>To him that hath, shall more be given; But from him that hath not, shall be taken away even that which he hath.</hi> And,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62667:181"/> tho where there was occasion, he would speak with great Authority, yet when he came to discourse with his Children and Servants about these things, he would speak with much familiarity and condescention to the meanest of their capacities, thereby insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating himself into their affections, begetting a Love in them to the word, and taking opportunity thereby to make things more plain and easy to their understandings.</p>
               <p>He was much and frequent in Prayer: He often prayed with his Wife alone; And <note place="margin">Frequent in Prayer.</note> when any great occasion fell out in the Day, he would retire into his Closet to ask Counsel, and a Blessing from the Lord. Every Month he kept a private Fast by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, (besides what he did upon emergent occasions) to seek the Lord, and the better to prepare himself for the Lords Supper, at which time also he had much upon his heart the concernments of the Church; when ever any affliction befel him, or any in his Family, or of his Relations, his constant course was, to seek the Lord in an extraordinary way. And if there were any great business that he was to undertake, or any great strait wherein he needed divine Counsel, or Protection, he still set time apart in a more than ordinary manner, unto which he used to have some gracious return or other.</p>
               <p>And besides his set times of Prayer, he was frequent in holy Ejaculations, which proceeded from the Spiritual frame of his heart; he was very punctual in keeping his times and seasons for Prayer, Reading, and Meditation. Tho his worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness were sometimes very urgent, yet was he always very loth to abridge himself in his wonted course for holy exercises, and if at any time he was abridged of his full time, he would redeem the next opportunity, to regain what time he had lost. He used to say, that when he did hasten over holy duties out of an eager desire to follow his worldly business, he did many time meet with a cross in them, but when he did spend his ordinary time, God did make his other Business to prosper the better; or if not, his mind was brought to submit to the Will of God.</p>
               <p>In all his Prayers, whether alone or with others, his heart was greatly affected and <note place="margin">A holy heart.</note> carried out with much holy Zeal and fervency. In his old age his heart would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten melt and be dissolved into Tears, and his affections seemed to be as vigorous as the affections of young converts; when he joyned with others in Holy duties he was far from remiss and careless carriage. His deportment was so Reverent, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such affections that the Minister under whom he lived, would profess, that he found himself much quicked by observing his lively affections: If at any time he found a deadness coming upon him, it grieved him more than any outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In a Letter wherein he had spoken of a bodily distemper, he adds this; <hi>That which troubles me now is the distemper of my Spirit; because I find my self less lively in holy thing, and more unactive than formerly: Yesterday (blessed be God) I found some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he awoke in a Morning before his ordinary time, yet he would get up; and his manner was to spend some time in Meditation, for the most part about the great work of our Redemption, and on the Eternal Sacrifice of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> which he offered up to his Father for the taking away of his peoples sins: And he used to Counsel his Children, every morning to take a turn at the <hi>Cross of Christ,</hi> and to think of his Sufferings, which (said he) will be a means to make you love Christ the more. As he dressed himself in a morning, he would drop some holy Instructions or other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those that were about him; and when he was ready, his first work was to retire into his Closet, where he spent a considerable time in Reading, Meditation, and Prayer.</p>
               <p>Every morning he read some part of the Scriptures, with some Commentary upon the same, especially with <hi>Calvins Exposition,</hi> which he much delighted in for the Spirituality, and solidness thereof.</p>
               <p>Having ended his private Devotions, he used to call his Family together, to whom he Communicated what he had learned by his own Meditation, and by what he had <note place="margin">His Exercise in the morning.</note> learned from the Authors which he read: And whatsoever his worldly business were, he would rarely omit this excercise in his Family. And such was his modesty and humility in mannaging this business, that he would tell them, that he would not take upon him to interpret the Scripture, but only would communicate to them what he had learned from Judicious Divines. By this constant course of Reading and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation he became expert and mighty in the Scriptures, so that in his Family duties, he would open the Scriptures with much clearness of Judgment, the Lord enduing him
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62667:182"/> with a more than ordinary ability to make things plain and familiar to the meanest capacity: And when he came to apply things to those of his own Family, he would carefully consider every ones condition, and those whom he feared to be still in the State of nature, he would lay open to them the danger of their present condition, and what a sad thing it was for them to remain out of <hi>Christ;</hi> And whatever the matter was that he had been speaking of, his Exhortation still was, to press them to look after <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom the Father had laid up all Grace, and from whom they must expect to receive all Grace; And his exhortations were set on with great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: And there was so great a presence of God with him, that many (besides his own Family) who occasionally came to his House, and heard him, will have cause to Bless God for him to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Having spent a quarter of on hour or little more in these exhortations, he would close up the duties with Prayer, wherein he would not be long: but his Prayer was so substantial, that he would comprehend the whole of Religion in a short Prayer. His Prayer seemed to be nothing but a digested Meditation acted by the Spirit of God; every passage in it had its weight, and not one Sentence could well be spared. Tho he varied in his Form, yet the substance and materials of his Prayers were for the most part the same, yet still he took in the other necessities of his Family, as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Providences of God gave occasion. The main scope at which his Prayers were levelled, was the glory of God; he was still carried above himself to eye and aime at that, and still he would thus be expressing it; <hi>Lord glorifie thy self in our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Glorifie thy self in bestowing this or that Grace upon us.</hi> The matter of his Prayer was still commensurate to the word; what the word required of us as a duty, either in our general or particular Callings, or in Relation to the various Providences of God, that was still the matter of his Prayers; he was most eminent in this, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very large and comprehensive Charity, he would still take in the concernment of the Church Catholick, and would constantly pray for all that Election where ever they were.</p>
               <p>In the Evening, before Supper, if he could get liberty, he spend would some time in <note place="margin">His Evening Exercise.</note> Reading the works of some Eminent Divine; and he took most delight in Dr. <hi>Prest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> Books, wherein he was so conversant that most of the choifest passages in his Writings, became very familiar with him. Then he betook himself to his constant course of Prayer and Meditation. After Supper he caused his Children, and the young Scholars that were in his House (which for many years was never empty of such, who were sent to the Grammer School, and by their Parents were placed in his Family, to enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his Instructions and holy Example,) each of them to Read a Chapter; which being done, he would call together his whole Family, and would spend the rest of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Catechising,</hi> or in repeating some Sermon that had been Preached in the week day.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was approaching, he would endeavour so to order his affairs, that he might dispatch his worldly business in due season, and so have the more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <note place="margin">Sabbath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note> in the Evening to set his heart in order for the the duties of the <hi>Lords Day;</hi> when it was come he would spend most of the Morning in secret Prayer and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he used to be shorter in his Family duties on that day than on others, that so they might not be hindred from attending upon the Publick Ordinances. And his care was to be there at the Beginning; and he used to say, that it was fitter for them <note place="margin">How spent.</note> to wait for the Minister, than that the Minister should wait for them; And he would often mention the example and Speech of <hi>Cornelius</hi> (Act. 10. 33.) <hi>We are all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God:</hi> The Morning Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon being ended, he would spend the little time he had before Dinner in looking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Notes, and in Meditating upon what he had heard.</p>
               <p>Dinner being ended, he used to repeat the Sermon to his Family, and so hasten to the Congregation. After the Sermon he used to spend a considerable time in secret, and the rest of the Evening was spent in Repetition of the Sermon, and in calling his Family to an account of the things which they had learned.</p>
               <p>He highly esteemed and Reverenced Godly Ministers, tho they were very mean and of low parts and gifts he would shew much respect to them; And according to his <note place="margin">His high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of Godly Ministers.</note> own practice, he would often exhort his Children, and those about him to have an high esteem of the Gospel Ministry, often pressing upon them those words of our Saviour <hi>Christ, He that heareth you, heareth me, and he that despiseth you, dispiseth me, and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.</hi> He would mind them also of what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said, that <hi>Faith came by hearing, and hearing of the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:62667:182"/>
               <p> He would often tell them, that God could, if he so pleased, speak unto them himself; but choosing to condescend to our infirmities, he rather speaks to us by men like our selves: He could have spoken to <hi>Cornelius</hi> himself, or have caused the Angel to Preach to him; but he bids him to send for <hi>Peter,</hi> who should tell him what to do. He could not endure that any should account our Ministry <hi>Anti-Christian,</hi> but upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions would vindicate them against all opposers, and would say, <hi>That unless we firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Ministry to be the appointment of</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>we cannot so profit by it as we ought to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He would say that it was lawful for us to covet the best gifts, if we might enjoy them, but we must not despise the meanest. He said, <hi>When you come to the Ordinance, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is between God and you, and whether the Instrument be of meaner or greater Parts, yet this is the Portion that God allots you.</hi> And he said, <hi>That there was not the weakest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that ever he heard, but the Lord did him good by it. When I meet with a Sermon that doth not like me, I first look into my self to see if there was nothing amiss there; And if there were no fault there, I would then scan it over again. For we many times blame the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, when as the fault is our own, that we have not prayed for him as we should have done.</hi> His love to the word was such, that tho there were two Ministers in the place where he lived, and a weakly Lecture, yet even in his old age he would ride six or seven Miles to enjoy the benefit of a weekly Lecture at <hi>Exeter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His desires were much carried out for the Conversion of Souls. He seldome pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Conversion of Souls desired.</note> but he would pray with great affection for all in his Family, and for all others that belonged to Gods Election, that were yet uncalled: And in his Family exercises he would still be speaking somewhat that might make them see their need of <hi>Christ;</hi> and that which he pressed most was, that they would labour to get into <hi>Christ,</hi> and to make sure of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was full of bowels of compassion to those that were under Temptations, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress <note place="margin">Compassion to the Tempted.</note> of Conscience, several of which did resort to him, and some did abide in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily for a season, the better to enjoy the benefit of his Counsel and Prayers; and God was pleased so to bless his endeavours, that they went away with peace and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Himself also was not without his Temptations, tho his assurance remained unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. <note place="margin">Temptations.</note> Once indeed in sickness, he was strongly assaulted by Satan, who suggested to him that he was an Hypocrite, and that all he had done was in hypocrisie; But the Lord put it into his heart to answer, <hi>Be it so, yet now I will cast my self upon the grace of God in Christ,</hi> and hereupon the Temptation immediatly vanished. And he was not without other Temptations, especially unto Infidelity. A day or two before his death he complained to a near Relation, that he had been troubled with grievous Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to question whether there were such an one as <hi>Christ,</hi> and whether there had been such Actions done by him as are Recorded? But the Morning after, these words were dropped into him: <hi>I was Crucified for thee: I shed my Blood for thee.</hi> This melted his heart exceedingly, that when his Temptation was of so grievous a Nature, yet the Lord should so condescend to him, that he could not speak without Tears.</p>
               <p>He had had also several other conflicts, so that he once brake out into this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression: <hi>O it is hard keeping up till we come to Heaven: It is hard fighting:</hi> And again; <hi>Before we receive our Crown, we must strive and finish our course: Temptations will arise.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His benefit by Afflictions.</note> But blessed is the man that endures Temptation; For when he is tryed he shall receive the Crown of Life. He said, <hi>that he had been Ten years striving against one corruption, and at last the Lord brake the neck of it:</hi> As also, <hi>I have been striving against the heighth of my Spirit these forty years.</hi> And as he had his inward conflicts so he was seldome without some outward Tryal and Afflictions. He said, it was one of his exercises e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Morning, to expect what God might try him with in the Day, either by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions or Temptations: Adding, <hi>I thought I had undergone many Tryals, so that now I might hope to be quiet, but still the Lord provides some new ones.</hi> And in a Letter to a near Relation, he said; That his life was made up of mixtures of encouragements and difficulties: And, I <hi>do think it may be much conducing to the glory of God, and to our Advantage, if we still expect such mixtures, knowing that we are thereunto appointed, and that so we may in every days success intreat the Lord for Grace suitable to our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and necessities; whereas, if we should limit the Almighty to have our Wills satisfied, we may displease him and create crosses to our selves:</hi> And as he was seldome without some
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62667:183"/> affliction or other, so they were of singular use to him. He said, <hi>whenever I was out of the way, the Lord shewed me clearly that I was so, and that this or that was not right, and this he did usually by Afflictions.</hi> He sayd, <hi>He never had any Chastisement in all his Life, but the Lord had shewed him some miscarriage by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His afflictions made him pray much; and that was his constant course when any Tryal befel him, to set time apart to seek the Lord in an extraordinary manner: And in all his afflictions, his great request to the Lord was: That he might be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his holiness thereby. When his Family was visited with the smal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ox, he was mightily stirred up to pray, that this Visitation might end in the Reformation of it, and that they might set to the work of God with all their might: And this was usually the fruit of all his Afflictions, to make him more active in the ways of God.</p>
               <p>When one of his Relations had been sick, he wrote thus unto him: <hi>Truly I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lords mind is to wean us from the world, and from Self: Now the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the good pleasure of his Will in us to the utmost, that we may cleave unto him whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully, by the wisdom and strength of the Lord Jesus in us: Be not dismayed at your Afflictions; the Lord will turn them to Good.</hi> A few years before his Death, the Lord tryed him by suffering his house to be on Fire, upon a Saturday-night about <note place="margin">A special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> ten a clock, most of the Family being in Bed, and himself asleep: Being awakened by some that first descried the danger, and called upon to arise for his safety, the first thought that God put into his mind was, that <hi>God in Judgment would remember Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> And God in mercy answered his Prayer: For only his Out-houses were burnt, and his Dwelling-house was preserved, which yet joyned to the other. Yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God was wonderfully seen in its preservation, and his Friends, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and the Poor of the Town came in to his assistance, and tho all his Goods were carried out, and there were many necessitous people, who might have convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away several things, yet such was their Love and Respect to him, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they had of his Charity, and readiness to do them good, that he lost not any thing, but all his goods that were carried forth, were preserved intire, without the loss of any one thing. And that which added much to the Mercy, was, that the Fire was so soon quenched, and his Goods set so soon in order by the help of his Friends, that he had liberty to attend upon the Ordinances the next day, and to Sanctifie the <hi>Sabbath</hi> according to his wonted manner.</p>
               <p>This affliction he attributed to his not putting away an evil Servant (whom he had <note place="margin">Afflictions sanctified.</note> often admonished, and yet he was not reformed) tho he oft had thoughts of putting him away, but being slack in doing it, he thought that this was the reason why the Lord so corrected him. When at an other time the Lord had made some breach upon his Estate, he said, <hi>The Lord had hereby shewed him, that if he leaned too much upon these things, God would take them all away.</hi> Also speaking about afflictions in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he said, <hi>For mine own part I do acknowledge to the glory of God, that our only wise God and heavenly Father hath taken the best course with me. O how lazy had I been and worldly, if the Lord had not hedged up my way: But blessed be God who will not suffer me to live after the Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was very sensible of the least Mercy, and a curious observer of every Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <note place="margin">Mercies sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> When at another time his House had been in danger of burning, writing to a near Relation, he thus expressed himself. <hi>The Lord make us really Thankful, and teach us what to render for all Mercies and deliverances; Especially for that great deliverance from wrath to come; and for the hope of Eternal Life, which God, who cannot lye, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</hi> He was very curious in observing the least check or rebuke from Providence in every thing that befel him. And upon the least cross, he would presently hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself before the Lord, and pray that he might understand his meaning in it.</p>
               <p>His great design was, that he might glorifie God in his whole Conversation; He studiously watched all opportunities for that end: And his great Prayer was, that <note place="margin">Gods Glory sought.</note> werever he came, he might either do or receive good: And prayed, that we might not only Glorifie God, but that we might do it intentionally. He did not speak of the things of God customarily, or because others spake of them; but if opportunity were not offered, he would seek it, and fasten some good discourse upon those with whom he conversed. The Minister that Preached at his Funeral had this passage: <hi>The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral bent</hi> (sayd he) <hi>and biass of his Spirit was towards God, and towards his Name;</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:62667:183"/>
                  <hi>The very quintessence of his Spirit carried him that way, and that intensively and constantly: I could never observe in him that he intended any thing more, or minded any thing so much as the Glory of God. Did you converse with him about Worldly affairs, he would reduce you by little and little, to some Heavenly discourse: There would all the Lines of his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference Center.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His humility and Modesty was such, that if any godly Ministers were present, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Humility and Modesty.</note> whom he took to be his superiours, he would wait to see whether they would speak any thing for Edification; if they were silent or more slack, he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to engage them in good discourse, or else, before they parted would set in on foot himself: He used to be troubled if he was long in any Company, and nothing was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Edification. When he spoke of the things of God, he did it with much Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: The weight of the things he spake of, was much upon his Spirit, and he had his heart wholly taken up with them. Religion and the things of God were become na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural unto him: and look what vehemency of Spirit others had in prosecution of their worldly affairs, the same did he manifest in the things of God; and as himself was affected with them, so did he for the most part affect others. When he either Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled, or Reproved any, he would choose, as much as might be, to do it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Language, that so (as he spake) they might rather hear God speaking, than <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> hear him speaking, and so consequently, what was spoken might carry the more Authority with it. In his reproofs he would use great wisdom and compassion, and he so ordered his reproofs, that it might appear, that he only aimed at their Reformation, and the good of their Souls. And he greatly loved such as would faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reprove him for what was amiss. He often sayd, that he had never met with but one in all his life, that would be so faithful a Friend to him, as to tell him of what he apprehended to be amiss in him, and he loved him the better for it all the days of his Life.</p>
               <p>He was very eminent for his Heavenly-mindedness, and his Heavenly Affections. <note place="margin">Heavenly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedness.</note> He constantly prayed, that our Conversation might be in Heaven, whilst our Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was on Earth. And as he prayed so he lived: He sayd, <hi>Methinks that I look upon all things in this World, as Pictures of the things in the other World.</hi> And again; <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if God shal be All in All hereafter, the less we have to do with the Creature here (more than needs must) the more like we are to that life.</hi> And again; <hi>I am ashamed very much sometimes that I should delight in the Creature so much, and delight in God no more.</hi> When some of his Children were coming to visit him, fearing, out of a Godly Jealousy, lest they might be too much transported with a meer natural, and carnal Joy, and not make that Heavenly and Spiritual improvement as they ought, he wrote thus unto them before their coming: When <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias appeared in Glory, at the Glorious Transfiguration of</hi> Christ <hi>in the Mount, the talk they had</hi> (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith) <hi>was touching the decease of Christ, which he should accomplish at</hi> Jerusalem: <hi>And we (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things) may thence also learn, that its an Heaven-like disposition, in the midst of all our Earthly enjoyments, to think and talk of our departure hence. And as I write this to you, so I speak of it here, that both you and we may mingle our meeting here on Earth, with such thoughts and discourses, as may mittigate the bitterness of any afflicting Providences, and may contain our Spirits in an even temper by the expectation of that uninterrupted and Eternal Joy that we hope one Day to enter into, when we shall meet, never more to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.</hi> And in an other Letter he thus expressed himself: <hi>We have but an inch of time upon Earth, and then we enter into Eternity: O then let us pray continually, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, fervently, that our way may be right, and our hearts upright to the finishing all Gods Wills in Duty, according to our Relations in all well-pleasing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had a very tender Conscience, sensible of the least slip and failing; and tho <note place="margin">A tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> none was known to be more Charitable unto others, and to make a more Charitable construction of what was done by others, yet none was ever more severe against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or more curious to espy the least sinful defect, or irregularity in himself. When he discerned the Ebullitions of Pride, Self-love, Covetousness, Infidelity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When he saw the least mixture of carnal and self-ends in his good Actions: When he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served how prone he was to be biassed by Man-fearing, and Man-pleasing, from his Duty; this was an inexpressible trouble to him, and he would bewaile these infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with more bitterness, than many are wont to do for their grosser Sins. If he had at any time unawares, and on a sudden spoken a word which he judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly, and unsuitable to the gravity which he conceived became a Christian, he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62667:184"/> would bewail it greatly, and could not be at rest in himself till he had desired those whom he supposed might take offence, to pass it by. He was often complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Infirmities, and he rarely spake of his Comforts or Spiritual Joyes, but oft of what he found amiss in himself, and many things which are much slighted by others, were curiously observed by him. In a Letter he thus expresses himself, <hi>My unthankfulness (besides mine other sinful Infirmities) grieveth me sore, and I am jealous of my self, lest the fear of the Lord doth trouble me more than grief for sin.</hi> And Again: <hi>I have found and do find a great difficulty (as in other things) so in this of health, to keep that narrow way of the Lord, for I find by woful experience that I am often slipping out, either too much indulgence, or too much severity, which may rather be termed cruelty: The Lord make us wise to avoid both these extreams.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His great care was to keep himself, not only from such things as were in themselves sinful and unlawful; But to abstain from all appearance of evil, and to cut off occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of offence from such as might seek them, or to be apt to take offence. He sayd, he had found by many years experience that the great difficulty that lay upon Saints, was, in the use of things lawful and indifferent: Saying, that he had been often o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken unawares this way, sometime by the leading aside of his own corrupt nature, which was ever willing to take the largest size, and sometime, by the mistaking of others who had misapprehended his intentions, and made an evil construction of his Actions; Yet God hereby made him more wise and circumspect. And hereupon he would advise to forbear lawful Recreations at some times and in some place, rather than by the use of our Christian Liberty, occasion the censures of any that are loose and large walking, tho unjustly raised.</p>
               <p>He was eminent in Resigning himself, and all he had to the Will of God. It was <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> his constant practice to pray his Will into an one-ness with the Will of God. He observed that it was very incident to our natures to desire to bring down Gods Will to ours, but it was much better to pray up our Wills into his. When any difficulty did occur, and his natural affections, and inclination would have carried him such a way, his first work was, not to pray so much that he might obtain that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would desire; but that his Will might be brought up to the Will of God, and that his Spirit migh be brought to an Holy indifferency, and the Lord eminently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him herein.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, before the issue of Providence was discovered, his Will was usually brought up to the Will of God, and in several great Cases and emergencies in his Life, wherein he was much concerned, he hath sayd. <hi>Touching the issue, and success of such a business, I have received power (through Grace) to acquiesce in the Will of God, when it is manifested.</hi> He made it also his endeavour to resign all he had to the Lords wise disposal. Having heard of the welfare of some of his Children, he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed himself, <hi>and now what thanks can I render unto God for you all? Only I desire to give all up to God, that hath given you to me for a time.</hi> His advice also to his Children was to follow his Example herein, and to give up their nearest comforts to God dayly.</p>
               <p>He much desired to be Spiritual in all he did, and that Grace, and not Nature, or fleshly wisdom might sway him in every thing. When a near Relation asked his Counsel in a business of concernment, before he would give his advise, he sayd: <hi>O that I might be wholly Spiritual; that no carnal respects might blind mine eyes?</hi> Wherever he was engaged in any difficulty, or was to mannage any business of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to the issue of it, his first care was to mind his duty, and to study which way Grace would teach him to act, and his great care was, that grace might have the principal sway in all his actions.</p>
               <p>He used to say, <hi>That duty was ours, but the issues and success of things belonged unto God. We should go study what our duty is, and then leave the issues and successes unto God.</hi> One that had desired his advice in a business of importance and great difficulty, he wrote back thus unto him: <hi>This one thing let us with incessant importunity crave of the Lord, that in this, as in all other things, he would teach us the way wherein we should go, and that we may walk with God, and follow him fully in the Integrity of our hearts, and then leave the success on his care, who is the only wise and Almighty, and our Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He advised that in all cases of Conscience we should seek resolution from the Word; and that in difficult cases we should ask Counsel of some able, faithful Minister. For <note place="margin">His advice in difficult cases.</note> (said he) <hi>The Priests Lips must preserve knowledge, and we were to enquire the Law at his Mouth:</hi> And God hath <hi>appointed Pastors and Teachers for the perfecting of Saints.</hi> And
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62667:184"/> concerning Ministers advice, he would say: <hi>That which they speak out of the Pulpit is to be perferred before that which they speak occasionally, and in a more private way of discourse: For it is to be supposed that they have consulted much with God, and have studied, and prayed hard for that which they deliver in publick and therefore more authority is to be given unto it, than to any occasional, or suddain Counsel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His desire was to be always in the exercise of grace, and to mind and attend pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent duty. He was much pleased with the saying of a Godly Minister: <hi>That a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His exercise of Grace.</note>
                  <hi>ought to be always in duty:</hi> And according to this, he made it his great study to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it was that God called him unto for the present, and what the present duty was that God put him upon. When he went to visit any one, he would consider what his Call was to go, and what opportunity he might have to do or receive good: And he much bewailed needless and Complemental visits, as things that did eat up, and consume much pretious time. When he used any bodily Recreation, he would do it as Duty, saying, <hi>That it was the Will of God that we should endeavour the preservation of health:</hi> And when he followed his Earthly affairs, he would do it as Duty, saying, <hi>That it was the Will of God that we should honour him in a particular Calling.</hi> And his great care was to make this particular Calling subservient to his General Calling: And his great endeavour was, so to order his Earthly affair, that they might not justle out the duties of Religion, nor himself to be abridged by them of convenient time for the more immediate service of God.</p>
               <p>By these means Religion was become so Spiritually natural to him, that he seemed wholly to be turned into it: Whatever he did and spake, for the most part, did not <note place="margin">Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came natural to him.</note> only favour of Grace, but it seemed to be wholly guided and acted by Grace: Not but that he had the remnants of the body of Death, which he bitterly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, but Grace had so great a sway and command in him, that there was little else but Grace that appeared unto others.</p>
               <p>He hath sayd, that when he was Carnal, he could have wished many of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments razed out of the Bible, but now he found his heart in some measure made suitable to the Law. He never thought his heart to be in a right temper, but when he could delight in the ways of God, and he used frequently to mention that Text: <hi>Blessed is the Man that feareth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his Commandments.</hi> He took such delight in the ways of God, and found so much satisfaction in them, that he spake thus with much seriousness: <hi>If I were sure, that as dies the Beast, so dies the Man; yet would I not chuse to be otherwise than I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of his most eminent Graces was his faith and living upon <hi>Christ,</hi> which was the true Root from whence his other great attainments in Christianity did arise. It <note place="margin">His living by Faith on Christ.</note> was the great work of his Life to go wholly out of himself, and to live wholly upon <hi>Christ</hi> for all. These were some of his frequent expressions in Prayer: <hi>Take us wholly out of</hi> self, <hi>and let our whole dependance be upon</hi> Christ <hi>Make us one Spirit with</hi> Christ, <hi>and let us be acted by his Spirit, that so we may not live so much as</hi> Christ <hi>may live in us. It hath pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell: Out of his fulness let us receive grace for grace. Thou hast appointed him to be Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, even all in all to thy People: Lord make him so to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was his constant and most familiar kind of Language, and as the bent of his Spirit lay most this way, so he counted it his greatest perfection. To some that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed him for his great measure of holiness, he sayd: <hi>The highest thing that I have attained to, is to go quite and clean out of my self, and to role my self wholly upon the grace of God in</hi> Christ. Herein he imitated the holy Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who, after the greatest measure of holiness that he had attained, yet was it his great desire to be found in <hi>Christ.</hi> This Holy Man was so curious in this point, of living intirely upon <hi>Christ,</hi> as that he never suspected himself more, or thought worse of himself, than when he found a secret inclination to look to somwhat in himself, and could not find himself so clearly brought off to acts of Self-denial: Whereupon he sayd: <hi>I have been apt to question my condition much, of late, because when I have found things amiss in me, and have found out any Salve, I would be quiet, and did not deny my self fully to rest on the grace of God in</hi> Christ.</p>
               <p>He often exhorted his Children that they should labour to deny themselves more and more, and study <hi>Christ,</hi> and learn him more and more: He was scarce ever known to give any holy Exhortations (in which he was most frequent and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant) but still he would be sure in the close to advise them to look to <hi>Christ</hi> for all Grace; and whatsoever duty he exhorted them to, he would still put them in mind
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62667:185"/> that the Grace and strength by which they were to perform this, was to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Christ</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>He was as eminent for living by Faith on the Promisses as on the person of <note place="margin">His Faith on the promises.</note>
                  <hi>Christ,</hi> resting upon the Lord in all his straits. When he could but take Sanctuary in some promise, and find out some word of God for his Faith to rest upon, he thought himself safe: He delighted to speak of that passage of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>Abraham gave glory to God by believing:</hi> He thought that the highest way of honouring God was to trust him upon his naked word and promise. Indeed he was often assaulted with Temptations of Infidelity, but these did but quicken him to pray more fervently, and in the conclusion, by these shakings his Faith got the deeper Root. The chief stream of his Prayers in his Elder years ran this way, that he might not <hi>stagger at the promise through unbelief:</hi> That he might be <hi>established in the Faith;</hi> and that his <hi>Faith might not fail;</hi> And the Lord answered him herein: For his Faith held out in its strength to the very last.</p>
               <p>Whenever he was in any strait or difficulty, and knew not which way to turn, the Lord did so bear up his heart by believing, that he would make out his way at last, and provide for his comfort some way or other. Speaking to a near Relation, of some touches of the Stone, and other infirmities that he laboured under, he added: <hi>But the Lord supports me; in whom I trust also that he will support me.</hi> Telling his Friends that he endeavoured to answer their request in praying for them, he sayd, that he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed pray for them daily, but it was with much weakness and infirmity; yet (sayd he) <hi>our trust is of acceptance in the Lord</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>who sits at the right hand of the Father, and makes request for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which was the Crown of all his Graces was his great Humility. As his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">His great humility.</note> and experiences were extraordinary, so he had more than an ordinary measure of Humility. He frequently used that expression of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of sinners. There was no corruption that he set himself more against than Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Pride. He would often mention that of the Apostle Saint <hi>Peter; God resists the Proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</hi> Whenever he begged any other Grace of God, he still begged Humility, as that which must prepare him, and make him capable of receiving that Grace. He used thus to express himself: <hi>Empty us of</hi> self, <hi>that we may be full with thy fulness: That we may receive more grace, make us more humble.</hi> He used also to warn and admonish others to beware of Spiritual Pride: <hi>Watch</hi> (sayd he) <hi>against that Stratagem of Satan, wherewith he usually assaulteth Souls in the Growth of Spiritual Gifts, which is, to puff them up with Pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He also would speak thus: As he sayd, <hi>Fight not against small or great, but only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King of</hi> Israel; <hi>So say I, above all, fight against</hi> self, <hi>and Pride.</hi> Writing to a near Relation, he sayd: <hi>Truly I find in every Days success the Ebullition of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of pride in me, and I rejoyce at your sensibility of it, and I have you in remembrance as to this very thing, I think I may say, dayly.</hi> Tho he was most sensible of the stiring of Pride in himself, yet by his long and daily praying and striving against it, he got so great a Victory over it, that others who beheld him, never saw greater demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Humility in any than in him.</p>
               <p>He was never known to boast of his own Excellencies, but he would often speak of his Infirmities, that so (as he used to say) God might have the more Glory, and himself shame. When he spake of God or in the cause of God, he would speak with great Authority, as ever any one of so private a capacity used to do: But when he spake of any thing relating to himself, he would still abase himself, and manifest the greatest lowliness of mind and self-denial; and he liked not that others should think too highly of him. Writing to one whom he feared to esteem him too much, he sayd: <hi>Think of me no otherwise than you see me: Only I hope I have obtained mercy to be faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His great care was to put off all from himself and to attribute all to the free Grace <note place="margin">Gods Glory sought.</note> of God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayd: <hi>Not I, but the Grace of God in me.</hi> And when he was carried out to any special or eminent exercise of Grace, he would say. <hi>I have received Grace to do this or that duty, or to believe this or that particular Promise.</hi> It was his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent saying: <hi>Let us remember to expect all from him, and to ascribe all to him.</hi> When he heard of the Grace of God in others, he used much to rejoyce in it, and he was never known to envy the Gifts or Graces of others, but rejoyced exceedingly to hear of them, and blessed the Lord for them as for himself. He loved holiness for holiness sake,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62667:185"/> and therefore when he saw it in any, he rejoyced in it as much as if it had been in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Hearing of the Grace of God bestowed upon some, he sayd: <hi>Blessed be the Lord for ever and ever. Who are we that we should be able to will any thing after this sort? The Lord keep it in the purpose of our hearts for ever, and prepare our hearts to him.</hi> The great thing which he begged of God for himself, and his near Relations was, that God would make use of him and them to be some way servicable to him whilst they live: And then sayd: <hi>One thing more I have begged of God, and shall beg, that both I, and you, and all that do receive the benefit, may look up, and give to God alone all the Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein lay the perfection of his grace, and wherein he came nearest to the Saints in heaven, that tho he desired to be most servicable, and to be carried forth in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way of exercising grace, yet when all was done, he desired not to be eyed, or look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the more; but his great desire was, that all that was done, might be seen to be of God, and that God might be admired the more. Writing to a near Relation, he sayd: <hi>I pray that God will make use of my self and you in such a way, as that God alone may be seen, and we not taken notice of at all: That be may have the Glory, and we not be seen.</hi> He mightily rejoyced to see Religion honoured. When an old Christian, that had been a professor of Religion many years, died, and had held out in his Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the end, without any stain upon his Conversation, he seemed to be transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an extraordinary joy, and could hardly speak of it without Tears. O, sayd he, <hi>such an one hath left no stain behind him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was greatly affected with a sense of Gods dispensations towards the Land: If <note place="margin">Fasting and Prayer.</note> there were any signs of Gods displeasure, and Judgments from God seemed to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, or if the Land lay under Judgments for the present, his course was to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself in a more than ordinary manner, and stirred up himself to pray with the more fervency. He used to say, that he looked above the Instruments, and second causes, and to transact all between God and him, and to consider what it was that God aimed at in every dispensation. In the time of our late troubles, he wrote to a near Relation thus: <hi>We had here with us as loud a Thunder as I ever heard. Our House</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note>
                  <hi>in which I was did shake: The Lightning also was extraordinary, such as I never saw in all my Life. I stood to see how it came forth at the breaking of the Clouds, and I saw (and so did many others with me) that out of the midst of the Lightning there came forth diverse times the likeness of fresh burning Coles of fire, so red and sparkling as any hot Iron can be when its heated to the uttermost in the Smiths Forge. These signs from Heaven, with the Sword drawn out upon Earth, do seem to speak aloud that our Provocations are very great. Joyn with us to intreat the Lord for Pardon and Reformation. Stir up your godly Friends to do the like: It may be the Lord will hear and spare, because he warns; or it may be such seekers may be hid, or marked out from the common destruction; Or if the outward Man pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, sure I am, that Soul shall find mercy that seeks the Lord in truth; He will in no wise cast out such a Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In an other Letter he wrote thus: <hi>At such a time fell abundance of Rain, and the waters were so high as have been seldome seen; many Mens Harvest is yet behind, and great loss likely to ensue: Our heavenly Father shakes now the Rod of Famine, as formerly of the Sword. O let us pray, that grace may turn all of us that are his, from our iniquities.</hi> In an other Letter speaking concerning the troubles and publick distractions that were in the Land, he thus expressed himself; <hi>Methink the voice of the Gospel, considered with the uncertainty of all things here below, doth seem to put us most seriously to resolve upon the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our affections upon things above; I hope it is our resolution with yours: But yet I think both you and we need more firmness in Resolution; else why should our wise, heavenly Father hold us at such uncertainties, if he did not see this to be best for us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In an other Letter, speaking of the publick troubles, he thus expressed himself: <hi>I believe that one end of our troubles may be to keep us up in a fervent frame of praying: That we may pray our selves more and more, into that heaven like Conversation; in wich the Antient Saints have been inabled to out-live their troubles; and so I trust shall we.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a man of a sound Judgment and most stable in the Faith, insomuch that, <note place="margin">His soundness in the Faith.</note> tho he had been a professor of Religion for many years, and lived in such a time wherein so many opinions and errours sprang up, yet he never took up, much less was fond of any private, particular, or Novel opinion. But he always preferred the old Divinity, and liked that Doctrine best, which he knew to be held and maintained, by the generality of Godly, Sober, and <hi>Orthodox</hi> Divines. When he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62667:186"/> perceived that any were led aside into unsound and corrupt principles, by Satans subtilty, and their own weak Judgment, he would pray with great compassion and tenderness for their reduction and recovery.</p>
               <p>Indeed herein he was very eminent; instead of censuring others or quarreling with them about their opinions, he did Conscientiously set himself to pray for them; and as he had opportunity, he would, in the Spirit of meekness endeavour, by setting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the clearest and plainest Texts of Scripture that opposed their opinions, to inform them in the Truth. And being sensible how much the work of <hi>Christ</hi> was hindered by the falling away of many that had newly taken up the profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to vain opinions, his Prayers ran much that way, that the Lord would please to reduce wandring Souls, and he used to exhort others to do the like: O (sayd he) <hi>let us be earnest with our God to establish us and ours, and all his People in the truth of the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Charity towards others was very Exemplary where he saw any thing of <hi>Christ</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Charity to Souls.</note> or sincerity, tho mixed with some errours in Judgment, and accompanied with other infirmities; his Charity would pass over those defects, and embrace that of the grace of God that he apprehended to be in them: He loved to make the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Actions of others, and if it could possibly admit of a Candid inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, he would be sure to construe it in that sense. It was a Rule with him, never to speak of the faults and failings of others behind their backs, except it were in two cases; either that it might some way or other tend to the persons Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or else to warn others to take heed of such an one that might do them a mischief. Neither could he patiently endure to hear an evil report concerning others; and it was the most unpleasing discourse to him, to hear the infirmities of others blazoned without a cause.</p>
               <p>He was ready to distribute to the necessities of others to his power, yea many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <note place="margin">Charity.</note> his power. His House was free and open at all times for the entertainment of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ministers, and other good persons that came to visit him. He was a Lover of Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and spent a great part of his Estate that way. Few weeks passed wherein his House was not a receptacle to entertain, and lodge some Godly person or other. And none could be freer, more hearty and ingenuous in the entertainment and respect that he gave unto others, whether they were his familiar friends, or strangers. His Love was truly according to the Apostles Rule: <hi>Let Love be without dissimulation:</hi> And all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment he gave, might easily be discerned to be done with all his heart; and he rejoyced that he had an opportunity to express his kindness to them. He did Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiously set apart some portion of his Estate yearly for pious uses; Some part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he gave to godly Ministers, another part in a yearly allowance to young Students at the University, and the other part to poor and necessitous people, as providence gave occasion: Besides, his Doors Ministred a constant relief to the poor of the place where he lived, who were very numerous.</p>
               <p>He was very just and righteous in all his dealings with men: He would rather part with his own right than do the least wrong to any. When he drew near to his end, <note place="margin">His Justice.</note> having been intrusted with the imployment of considerable summs of Mony that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to several persons, his great care was to dispose of things so, and to put all into such an exact Method, as that every one might have his own, and that none might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> the least wrong or prejudice, which he did to the general satisfaction of all.</p>
               <p>When any came to complain to him of their dissentions, he would exhort them, first <note place="margin">How he made up differences.</note> of all to make their peace with God and to endeavour to set all right betwixt him and them, and then God would quickly turn the hearts of their Enemies to be at peace with them. He had the general repute of a Man so just and unbyassed, that many times both the dissenting parties would refer the whole business to his single determination, and they were content to yield and stand to what agreement he should bring things to. When he went about such businesses, he would usually begin with Prayer. Being once called to make up a difference between some neer Relations, he moved that they might first begin with Prayer, but one of the persons there present declared his unwillingness thereunto, whereupon he soon took his leave, and sayd to a Friend that came away with him: <hi>O! we shall be able to do no good in it.</hi> In making up breaches, he was as careful to make the disagreeing persons friends, as to compose the differences that were between them: And he had an excellent dexterity to use Motives and Arguments, taken, as well from the Laws of the Land as from the Laws of God to press them to come to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62667:186"/> an Agreement. Such was his Love of peace, and desire to promote it, that when it hath been a matter of cost and something hath been to be paid, and the party that was to pay it hath refused to part with the Mony, rather than the breach should not be made up, he hath paid it out of his own Purse.</p>
               <p>Many times he had mony put into his hands by some Godly persons, to dispose of as <note place="margin">Prudence and Piery in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> he saw cause; which being known, when some poor people have come to him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, he would always give them some Spiritual Alms, before he distributed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And if any of them were guilty of any notorious and scandalous sin, he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make tham sensible of it, and to bring them unto Repentance for the same.</p>
               <p>He was a great promoter and upholder of the meetings of Christians for Prayer and holy conference which tended to Spiritual Edification; but an Enemy to such meetings where they met together to discourse of State affairs, or to talk of opinions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted points, or where the time was spent meerly for an Ostentation of mens parts and gifts, not aiming at the Spiritual Edification of one another: And this appeared by the caution which he used in setting down Rules for the Ordering and regulating such Christian meetings; which were these.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. They ought not to be in the time of publick Ordinances.</item>
                  <item>2. Nor to the hindrance of Family duties.</item>
                  <item>3. Nor in places, or with persons of an evil report.</item>
                  <item>4. Nor to the hindrance of Mens particular Callings.</item>
                  <item>5. Nor by night, or other suspected times.</item>
                  <item>6. Nor for controversies of disputation.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. But for the clearing and setting home of Truths received in the publick Ministry, and in clearing of Cases of Conscience arising thereupon or otherwise. And in such Exhortations, Admonitions, Counsels, and Consolations as conduce thereunto, or that are otherwise necessary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In some convenient time of the day, for an hour or two at the most, and once in the week at most, except in some urgent Cases.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In some family of good report, and with persons of good report.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That every one present may have liberty to speak one by one.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That they begin and end with prayer for a blessing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Minister of the place, or some other godly Minister may be desired to be present.</p>
               <p n="7">7. All being ended, that presently every one departs to his place and duty, and to walk sutably, that the ways of God be not evil spoken of.</p>
               <p>When he first began to set up this way of Christian conference, some godly persons were offended, fearing that such a meeting might minister opportunity for the venting and spreading of Errors, which were to rise at that time. And others feared that it might take off some from the love and esteem of the publick Ministry: But when this paper (drawn up with his own hand) came abroad, it was sufficient to satisfie all inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and unprejudiced persons; and this meeting was so far from giving occasion of spreading Errors, that the godly of that place, were by this means kept stedfast in the Faith.</p>
               <p>And this arose much from the wisdom which God had endowed him with: For his <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> prudence was such in ordering those meetings, as the time which was spent in them, was taken up, for the most part, in discoursing of some main Article of Religion, or some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techetical point; by this means the Christians in that place were so rooted and grounded in the faith, as that they were not so soon shaken by Temptations, as many others were in other Parts of the Kingdom, who had not the principles of Religion infused into them, nor rendred so familiar with them.</p>
               <p>But that which did most of all commend him, and most set forth the grace of God <note place="margin">The conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Graces in him.</note> in and towards him was, that he did not only attain to an eminency in this or that grace, but he arrived to a great degree in every grace, so that there was no grace but might be clearly seen and discerned to be in him, and in each of them he seemed to excel: As holy affections, and a spiritual fervour in prayer; zeal for Gods glory, faith, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, meekness, patience, submission to the Will of God, heavenly-mindedness, charity and compassion unto others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there was such an eminency in every grace, as that it was hard to say in which of them he excelled most.</p>
               <p>As he thus walked with God many years, so he kept his integrity to the end: And
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62667:187"/> that which was most remarkable was, that in his Elder years he seemed to excel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: <note place="margin">His Progress in Grace.</note> He did not only retain the lustre of his former Graces, but he was still more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, active, and lively in the ways of God: he spent more time in Prayer, Meditation, and other holy Exercises: He was more abundant in holy Counsels and Exhortations. He oft said, <hi>Since our time is short, let us work the faster, and watch and pray the more fervently. Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his Garments.</hi> He minded little else but spiritual concernments: Grace seemed to have the whole command of him. Being asked by a friend, how it came to pass that now in his elder years he had more command over his Affections, and Passions, than in his younger? He answered, <hi>That it was not, because he found not the same things in his nature still: For he found himself more inclined unto Passion than before: But because the grace of God had now overcome, and overpowred him, and reduced him to the present temper wherein he now was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had a long and constant remembrance of his change before it came, accounting <note place="margin">Death expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> himself but a <hi>Pilgrim and Stranger</hi> upon Earth. Divers years before his death, he seldom Wrote a Letter to his near Relations, but he expressed his sense of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching change. In a Letter to some of his nearest Relations he thus expressed himself: <hi>Our time of our departure hence, draweth near. O pray for us as we desire to do for you, that we may be found blameless at that day.</hi> And in another, after he had been sick, he Wrote: <hi>Pray for me that I may not be taken hence unready: Nor yet my life be longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired than all Gods work by me, and in me be done.</hi> A year or two before his death, he much rejoyced to think that so much of his race was run, and said, <hi>That he would not for a great deal be set back, and to have those years to live again that he had already passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> About five or six weeks before his last sickness whereof he died, he thus expressed himself: <hi>I am old (as</hi> Isaac <hi>said) and know not the day of my death: pray for me that I may be faithful unto the death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>December Anno Christi,</hi> 1659, he fell sick of a lingring distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <note place="margin">His last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> which continued upon him about the space of ten weeks, before the Lord was pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put a period to his Race. In the beginning of this sickness he had some intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Lord about his change: And the Lord, the better to prepare him for it, had fastened the impression of it upon him before it came. When the Minister of the place where he lived came to visit him, and said, he hoped he might recover: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>He knew not how God might deal with him: But he had received the sentence of death in himself:</hi> A little before, he thus Wrote to some of his near Relations: <hi>Beloved in the Lord, I am yet (through mercy) alive; and continue sick: My God dealeth bountifully with me, who do from my heart acknowledge that I am a chief of sinners; yet hath he pardoned me, and will e're long receive me to be with</hi> Christ, <hi>which is best of all. Pray for me that I may give God his due glory by believing, and by a holy submission and conformity to his Will in Life and Death. Blessed be God, I have in my weak measure set my house in order,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was able, he continued to pray in and with his Family, and speaking some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them out of the Word read; and when he found his spirits so low, and so much spent that he could not do so much as formerly, he told them, that it was the grief of his soul that he could do no more for them.</p>
               <p>His deportment all the time of his sickness, and at his death, was suitable to his Life. As he had lived Exemplarily, so he died Exemplarily. The whole of his carriage was (as one who was judicious, and an Eye witness of it, testified) as if it had been a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died piece. His great care was, that Grace might be seen to act in him at his death, as his chief care had been to express it in his Life. He was naturally a man of a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and fearful spirit. But when he came to die, Grace had so elevated him above his natural temper, that he was not only willing to die, but he triumphed over death, without being afraid of it.</p>
               <p>He delighted not to speak much in the time of his sickness, but imployed it for the most part in holy Meditations: yet he sometimes spake to such as came to visit him, in some short sentence or other. His usual Exhortation to them was this: <hi>Make sure</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His dying Speeches.</note>
                  <hi>of Christ: Remember that one thing necessary.</hi> Once, when some of the younger sort were about him, he said, <hi>Make sure of Christ: And for your encouragement I tell you, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is no vain thing: Is no notion: 'Tis a reality; and I tell you so from mine own experience.</hi> And at another time, seeing some young ones talking familiarly together, he said to them, He knew not what they were talking about, but commended their Love: only they should be sure to speak something to the edifying of one another: And that they should have their <hi>speech seasoned with the salt</hi> of the word: For the <hi>Lord hearkened, and heard,</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:62667:187"/>
                  <hi>and there was a book of Remembrance Written for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.</hi> And when a person of quality came to visit him, he said: <hi>Hold on as you have begun: Make sure of Christ. If I had as much gold as would reach up to the Skie, it would do me no good: My interest in Christ is all my happiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At another time his Wife and Children coming about him, he said, <hi>I hope you have made choice of Christ:</hi> And he exhorted them to cleave unto him: Be diligent in the use of means, but when all is done, be sure to depend upon <hi>Christ:</hi> Take heed of the World, for that is your greatest Enemy: I have found it to be so. And particularly to his Children, he said, <hi>deny your self sinful self-pleasure, and self-profit, and the delights of the world; and seek your All in</hi> Christ, <hi>and in him you shall find All-sufficiency.</hi> When some good people, who used to have private meetings, came to visit him, he said to them; <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in prayer: Hold on: I am confident it is the way of God you are in.</hi> To the Minister of the place, who often visited him in his sickness, he said: <hi>Preach to win souls: Let all your Preaching be to win souls.</hi> And to his own Son he Wrote thus: <hi>My Son, take heed to the Ministry that thou hast received of the Lord, that thou fulfil it This will tend to the glory of God, to the good of Souls, and to thine account in the day of</hi> Christ, <hi>the great Shepherd of the Sheep.</hi> And to some that were going to a Fast, he said: <hi>Pray for me; but especially for the Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During all the time of his sickness he had not the least Cloud upon his Spirit, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Freedom from Temptations.</note> was Satan permitted in the least to disturb his Peace. When a Minister that came to visit him asked him, whether he had any Temptations? He answered, <hi>No: Blessed be the Lord he had none:</hi> So that although all his Life time, he had been full of Conflicts, yet when he came to die he had perfect peace and serenity. When he had been sick some weeks, he wrote thus to a near Relation: <hi>I yet live through Gods mercy, but do continue weak: Yet the Lord deals very gently with me: For my outward afflictions are tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and my inward consolations are full of Grace and Heavenly sweetness.</hi> These Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts continued with him to the very last: For at several times in his sickness, and the same day he dyed, he was heard to say: <hi>God hath left with me the Comforts.</hi> And when about an hour before his Death, his Natural Spirits being almost spent, he brake forth into this expression; <hi>My grief is great:</hi> One of his Relations that stood by, sayd, you do not mean in respect of your Spiritual Estate? He answered, with a little seeming dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, <hi>No, No: He hath, and doth, and will support by his Eternal Spirit.</hi> Thus the Lord was pleased to answer him, in that which had been his great desire for a long time, which was, That his Faith might not fail, and that he might be kept up in the Faith to the last. The Night before he dyed he spake thus: <hi>I have waited upon God for my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and blessed be God I shall not be disappointed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As was his manner in his Life, so at his Death, he was much in the acknowledgment <note place="margin">His self-denial.</note> of his own nothingness and vileness, and much in magnifying the free Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to him. The Minister that Preached at his Funeral had this passage concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: <hi>He was much</hi> (sayd he) <hi>in Self-denial even to the last; Looking on all that he had done as nothing; As dross and dung in comparison of</hi> Christ. Once when his Wife came to him and sayd, she prayed that she might follow his steps: He replied; <hi>Follow</hi> Christ: <hi>Follow</hi> Christ: <hi>He hath given you an Example: Blessed be God for Friends; But blessed be God for</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>who hath saved us from wrath to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His great desire was to be perfectly resigned up to the Will of God; and therefore his great request to his Friends, when they came to visit him was, <hi>Pray me up into the Will of God:</hi> And to some of his near Relations in the time of his sickness, he wrote thus; <hi>Pray for me and your self, that we may be taught, and made able by the Spirit of</hi> Christ <hi>in us, to resign and conform to our Fathers Good-will, that when Gods time is come, I may depart in Peace, unto that longed for everlasting Rest, which the</hi> Lord Jesus <hi>hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for me, and to which he will bring me: Even so Amen.</hi> And in an other Letter he wrote thus: <hi>I desire your Prayers for me whilst I live, that I may abide steadfast in the Faith of the Lord</hi> Jesus, <hi>whose I am, and by whom alone I expect Salvation: And that I may by Faith in the Lord</hi> Jesus <hi>have power from him, by his Spirit to submit and conform to his Will, both in life and death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the time of his sickness he was full of Holy <hi>Ejaculations,</hi> and <hi>Soliloquies.</hi> He <note place="margin">Soliloquies.</note> often used that passage of <hi>Hezekiah, I am oppressed; Lord undertake for me.</hi> And that of <hi>David: In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy Comforts delight my Soul.</hi> He often caused the <hi>16th. Psal.</hi> and the six first verses of the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>Isaiah</hi> to be read to him; And speaking to himself alone, he often repeated these words, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 12. 2.)
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62667:188"/>
                  <hi>The Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>is my strength and my Song; He also is become my Salvation.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would say, <hi>Come Lord Jesus;</hi> and then would answer himself, Yea, <hi>he doth come: He comes leaping over the Mountains, and skipping over the Hills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which greatly comforted him was to think that he should immediatly be with the Lord as soon as his Race was at an end. A Christian Friend that visited him, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such an expression as this: That the bodies of the Saints should rest in the Grave as in a Bed of Down: Yea (sayd he) <hi>But this day thou shall be with me in Paradise.</hi> Intimating; That tho it were matter of Joy to think that his body should rest in peace till the General Resurrection; Yet his greatest comfort lay in this, to think that at the instant of dissolution, his Soul should enjoy the immediate sight of God. This appeared in his many ardent breathings which he used, saying: <hi>Come Lord</hi> Jesus. <hi>O how doth my Soul thirst for God! Go forth my Soul to meet thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was not only willing to die, but he longed to be dissolved and to be with <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Death desired.</note> The last <hi>Sabbath</hi> but one before his death, he sayd: <hi>O what a blessed</hi> Sabbath <hi>would this be, if this might be my entrance into my everlasting</hi> Sabbath! At an other time he sayd, <hi>Why should we not be willing to die?</hi> Christ <hi>came from Heaven to the Earth to free us from sin and misery: And why should not we be willing to go from Earth to Heaven to be freed from sin and misery?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two or three days before he dyed, he had a sore fit, and thought that he should then have died: But reviving a little, he called for his Wife and Children, to whom he sayd: <hi>This is the true Grace of God, wherein I stand; that I expect Salvation by</hi> Jesus Christ▪ <hi>and by him alone.</hi> And this he repeated again, and withal exhorted them; that they should give up themselves to <hi>Christ,</hi> and live upon him. A day or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed, when he saw his Children weeping about him, he sayd, <hi>Weep for your sins:</hi> And when his Wife was lamenting, saying, what should she do, when God took him away? He sayd, <hi>You must Repent for that word. Did</hi> Joseph <hi>say, without me God shall provide for the Life of</hi> Pharoah, <hi>and shall not God provide for you? Yes he Will: Only cast your self upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His understanding and memory continued with him to the last, insomuch that he wrote a Sheet or two of Paper a few days before his Death, for the better direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those that were to dispose of things after his Death. His <hi>Will</hi> was made long before for the setling of his Estate. And having finished this, he sayd, <hi>Now I know not any thing more that I have to do.</hi> And among these directions he gave a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charge that there should be no Blacks worn at his Funeral.</p>
               <p>The day wherein he dyed fel out to be on the Lecture day in that Town. And a near Relation coming to see him, he would not suffer him to stay with him, but seemed to put him off with his Hand, saying, <hi>Away, Away; You will come too late.</hi> For he would not have him lose the Sermon, tho it were the last time he was like to be with him.</p>
               <p>When his End drew neer, one that stood by, sayd: You see that a Holy Life brings a blessed Death: Whereupon he, lifting up his Hands, sayd, <hi>Yea: Yea: Yea:</hi> And a little before he dyed, he sayd: <hi>Lord</hi> Jesus <hi>receive my Soul.</hi> His time being now come, that he must leave the World, and go to the Lord, he called for something that he used to take in his sickness, which being brought, he (as his manner was) set himself to lift up his heart to the Lord in a short <hi>Ejaculation,</hi> and in that posture he breathed out his last, with his Hands clasped together, <hi>February</hi> the <hi>7th.

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Sir</hi> Matthew Hale, <hi>Knight, sometimes Lord Chief Justice of His Majesties Court of the</hi> Kings Bench, <hi>who Died,</hi> Anno Christi 1676.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>MAtthew Hale</hi> was born at <hi>Alderly</hi> in <hi>Glocestershire, November</hi> the first, <hi>Anno Christi</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Parentage.</note> 1609. His Grandfather was <hi>Robert Hale,</hi> an eminent Clothier in <hi>Wotten Ʋnder-Hedge,</hi> where he, and his Ancestors had lived for many Descents, and had given several parcels of Land for the use of the poor, which they enjoy to this day.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Robert</hi> had got an Estate of Ten thousand pounds, which he divided almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually among his five Sons, beside the Portions he gave with his Daughters. His se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son was <hi>Robert,</hi> who married <hi>Joan,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Matthew Poynts</hi> of <hi>Alderly,</hi> El{que} of which Marriage there was no other issue, but this one Son, whose Grandfather by the Mothers side, was his Godfather, and gave him his own name of <hi>Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Father was a man of such a tender Conscience, that he gave over the practice of the Law, whereunto he had been bred, because of some things commonly practised by Lawyers, which seemed to him contrary to that exactness of Truth and Justice which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Christian; whereupon he withdrew himself from the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> to live on his Estate in the Country. And thus we see what care he had of his Soul, which made him forsake so gainful a Profession, which might have enabled him to have raised his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much higher.</p>
               <p>He was in the Country, very charitable to his Poor Neighbours whilst he lived, and at his death, he left out of his small Estate (which was but an hundred pounds <hi>per annum)</hi> twenty pound <hi>per annum</hi> to the poor of <hi>Wotton,</hi> which this his Son confirmed to them, with some Addition of his own, and with this direction, that it should be distributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong poor House-keepers, not to such as received Alms from the Parish. For to give to such, was only to ease the Rich, who by Law are bound to relieve them.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Matthew</hi> was soon deprived of the happiness of his Fathers care, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For as he had lost his Mother before he was three years old, so now his Father died before he was five: So early he was cast upon the Providence of God, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence soon made up this loss in some good measure. For after some Opposition, he was committed to the care of <hi>Anthony Kingscot</hi> of <hi>Kingscot,</hi> Esq; who was his next Kinsman after his Uncles by the Mothers side.</p>
               <p>Great care was taken of his Education, and his Guardian intended him for a <hi>Divine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Education.</note> and being of those who were then called <hi>Puritans,</hi> he put him to such School masters as were of that party: And in the <hi>17th.</hi> year of his Age, sent him to <hi>Magdalen-Hall</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Obediah Sedgwick</hi> was his Tutor.</p>
               <p>During his being at School, and for some time after his coming to <hi>Oxford</hi> he was a <note place="margin">Corruption.</note> hard Student, and an extroardinary proficient; till some Stage players coming thither, he was so much corrupted by seeing their Plays, that he almost wholly neglected his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. By this he, not only lost much precious time, but found that his heart came there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be fill'd with such vain Images of things, that were at best unprofitable, if not hurtful unto him: And being afterwards sensible of the mischief of this, he resolved of never seeing any more Plays, which he constantly adhered to.</p>
               <p>His mind, being thus corrupted, he set himself to many other vanities which youth is addicted to. He loved fine Cloths, and delighted much in Company, and being of a strong body, he became a great Master in all those Exercises that required much strength. He learned also to Fence, and to use his Weapons, and grew so expert therein, that he worsted many of the Masters in those Arts.</p>
               <p>He was now so taken up with those Martial matters, that instead of proceeding in his Studies, he resolved to be a Soldier; and his Tutor <hi>Sedgwick</hi> going into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62667:189"/> as a Chaplain to the Renowned Lord <hi>Horatio Vere,</hi> he resolved to go along with him and to trail a Pike in the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Army. But a happy stop was put to this resolution. For he was engaged in a suit at Law with Sir <hi>William Whitmore,</hi> who laid claim to some part of his Estate, and his <hi>Guardian</hi> being of a retired temper, He was forced to leave the University, having been only three years in it, and to go to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to solicite his own business there: And being recommended to Serjeant <hi>Glanvil</hi> for his Counsellor, and he observing in him a clear apprehension, and a solid Judgment, and a great fitness for the Study of the Law, took pains to divert him from his thoughts of <note place="margin">Study of the Law.</note> being a Soldier, and to apply himself, to Study the Law, which so far prevailed, that when he was above twenty years old, <hi>November 8th.</hi> 1629, he was admitted into <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns-Inns,</hi> and being deeply sensible how much time he had lost, he resolved to redeem it, and for many years after he Studied sixteen hours in a day. He laid aside fine cloths, and used a plain fashion, which he mostly continued to his dying day.</p>
               <p>Yet he did not at first break off from keeping Company too much, till a sad accident drove him from it. For he, with some other young Students, going to be merry out of Town, one called for so much Wine, that Mr. <hi>Hale</hi> could not prevent it, but he drank so long till he fell down as dead among them. This much affected Mr. <hi>Hale,</hi> who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another room, and shuting the door, upon his Knees begged earnestly of God that his friend might be restored unto life, and that himself might be forgiven for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing such excess: And he vowed unto God that he would never so keep Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny again, nor drink an Health while he lived. His friend recovered, and he religiously observed his Vow. And though he was oft pressed to drink <hi>Healths,</hi> yet would not he Dispence with his Vow, though he was sometimes treated roughly for it.</p>
               <p>Now he forsook all vain Company, and divided his time between the duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <note place="margin">Industry.</note> and the study of the Law. He took a strict account of his time, for which end he drew a <hi>Scheme</hi> for a <hi>Diary,</hi> wherein he set down what his first work must be in the morning; what his days Imployment; what his Refreshments, whether alone, or in Company; what his Evening duties.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Noy,</hi> the Attorney General, one of the Greatest men of that Profession, took early notice of him, call'd for him often, and directed him in his studies, and shewed such friendship to him, that he was called young <hi>Noy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst he was thus busie in his studies, he kept the hours of the Hall constantly in <hi>Term time,</hi> and seldome put himself out of Commons in the <hi>Vacation</hi> time, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his studies with unwearied diligence. And he was soon found out by the great and learned Antiquary Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> who came to such a liking of him, that he continued a close friendship, and at his death made him one of his Executors.</p>
               <p>It was this acquaintance which first set Mr. <hi>Hale</hi> on a more enlarged pursuit of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which he before had confined to his own Profession: But soon becoming a great Master in it, he who could never lose any part of his time, found leisure to attain to as great a measure of knowledge, in as comprehensive a manner as most men have done in any Age.</p>
               <p>He studied the <hi>Roman Laws,</hi> and judging a readiness in <hi>Arithmetick</hi> as a thing that might be useful to him, he became very exquisite therein, and in all other <hi>Mathematical</hi> Sciences, sparing no cost to get exquisite Instruments. He read, observed, and writ much upon these Subjects, which he called his <hi>Diversions.</hi> He had good skill in <hi>Physick and Chirurgery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He searched greatly into Ancient History, and particularly into the crabbidest part of <hi>Chronology.</hi> But above all, he applied himself to the study of <hi>Divinity:</hi> So that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most incredible that one man in no great compass of years should have acquired such a variety of knowledge, and learning. His industry was almost indefatigable. His parts were quick, his apprehension, lively, his memory great, and his judgment strong. He rose constantly very early, and was never idle.</p>
               <p>He spent little time in eating and drinking: For as he never went to publick Feasts, so he gave no intertainment but to the Poor. He always ended his Meal with an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. <note place="margin">Temperance.</note> When our unhappy Wars began, he not only avoided all publick Imployments, but the very talking of News, and was always both favourable and charitable to the depressed party, and would never provoke any in particular by reflecting on their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>He was imployed in his practice by all the Kings party, and was assigned Counsel to the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> to Arch-bishop <hi>Laud, &amp;c.</hi> Afterwards being Councel for the Lord
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62667:189"/>
                  <hi>Craven;</hi> he pleaded with that force of Argument, that the then <hi>Attorny General,</hi> threatened him for appearing against the Government: To whom he answered, that he was pleading in defence of those Laws, which they declared they would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and that he was doing his duty to his <hi>Client,</hi> and therefore not to be daunted with Threats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> seeing him possest of so much practice, and being one of the eminentest <note place="margin">Advancements.</note> Lawyers, resolved to take him off, by raising him from the <hi>Bar</hi> to the <hi>Bench.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hale</hi> saw well the snare that was laid for him; for he had a Commission sent him to be a Judge in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> which he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> first scrupled to receive from a <hi>Ʋsurper:</hi> But having considered well of it, he Judged that it being absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to keep up <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> in all times, it was no sin to take a Commission from Usurpers, if he made no Declaration of his acknowledging their Authority, which he never did. He was thus made a Judge, <hi>Anno Christi.</hi> 1653.</p>
               <p>Sometime after he was chosen a <hi>Parliament Man</hi> by his Country. For there being at this time no <hi>House of Lords,</hi> Judges might be chosen to sit in the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> and thither he went, on design to obstruct the Mad and Wicked projects then on foot. And he continued Administring Justice till <hi>Oliver</hi> dyed: But then he both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the Mourning that was sent to him, and his Servants, as also to accept a New <hi>Commission</hi> that was offered him by <hi>Richard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He lived a private Life till the <hi>Parliament</hi> met that called home the King, to which he was returned Knight of the Shire for the County of <hi>Glocester.</hi> And in that Parliament he bore his share, in the happy period then put to the Confusions that threatned the ruine of the Nation. His great prudence and excellent temper led him to judge, that the sooner an Act of <hi>Indemnity</hi> were passed, and the fuller of graces and favours, it would sooner settle the Nation, and quiet the minds of the People; and therefore he applied himself carefully to the framing, and carrying it on till it was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Presently after when the Courts in <hi>Westminster-Hal,</hi> came to be setled, he was made <hi>Lord Chief Baron:</hi> And when the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> delivered him his <hi>Commission,</hi> he told him, that if the King could have found out an honester and fitter Man for that Imployment, he would not have advanced him to it. Its ordinary with such so promoted, to be Knighted, but he studiously avoided it, till the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving it, on a time when the King was at his House, sent for him, and when he came, told his Majesty, that his Modest Lord <hi>Chief Baron</hi> was there, whereupon he was unexpectedly Knighted.</p>
               <p>He continued eleven years in that Office, mannaging all the proceedings in it with singular Justice. He was also one of the Principal Judges that sat in <hi>Cliffords-Inn</hi> about setling the differences between Landlord and Tenant, after the Conflagration in <hi>London,</hi> in which he behaved himself so to the satisfaction of all; so that the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and quiet Building of <hi>London</hi> is in no small measure due to him. For he, first by way of <hi>Scheme,</hi> contrived the Rules, upon which he and the other Judges after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proceeded, in which his readiness in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> and his skill in <hi>Architecture,</hi> were of great use to him.</p>
               <p>Bt it will not seem strange that he behaved himself so well as he did in his place, if we consider what Religious and excellent Rules he drew up, and proposed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to walk and act by in all his Imployments in the Station and Calling wherein God and his King had set him, which he stiled <hi>Things necessary to be continually had in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That in the Administration of Justice, I am intrusted for God, the King and Country. 2. That it be done. 1. Uprightly. 2. Deliberately. 3. Resolutely.</item>
                  <item>2. That I rest not upon mine own understanding or strength, but implore, and rest upon the direction and strength of God.</item>
                  <item>3. That in the Execution of Justice, I carefully lay aside mine own Passions, and not give way to them, however provoked.</item>
                  <item>4 That I be wholly intent upon the business I am about, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. That I suffer not my self to be prepossessed with any Judgment at all, till all the business, and both parties are heard. Divers other such like excellent Rules he set down, which for brevity sake are here omitted.</item>
               </list>
               <p>He would never receive private Addresses, or Recommendation from the Greatest Persons, in any matter in which Justice was concerned. Once, one of the first <hi>Peers</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:62667:190"/> of <hi>England,</hi> went to his Chamber, and told him, that having a Suit of Law to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him, he was come to acquaint him with it, that he might the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it when it should be heard in the Court.</p>
               <p>Upon this the <hi>Lord Chief Baron</hi> interrupted him, and sayd, <hi>he did not deal fairly to come to his Chamber about such Affairs. For he never received any Information of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Courage.</note>
                  <hi>but in open Court, where both parties were to be heard alike,</hi> and so he would not suffer him to go on.</p>
               <p>Hereupon his Grace (for he was a Duke) went away not a little dissatisfied, and complained of it to the King, as a rudeness which was not to be endured. But his Majesty bid him content himself that he was no worse used, and sayd: <hi>He verily Believed, he would have used himself no better, if he had gone to Sollicite him in any of his own causes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of his Rules was still to favour those that were lowest. Besides his great Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> to <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> who were then as he thought too hardly used; he took care to cover all he could from the Severities sore designed against them, and discouraged such as inclined to stretch the Laws too much against them. He thought many of the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> had merited highly in the matter of the Kings Restauration, and at least deserved that the terms of <hi>Conformity</hi> should not have been stricter than they were before the War: And he lamented the too Rigorous proceedings against them, saying, they were good Men, but they had narrow Souls, who would break the peace of the Church for such inconsiderable matters.</p>
               <p>He was a strict observour of the <hi>Lords Days,</hi> in which, besides his constant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance <note place="margin">Piety.</note> upon the Publick service of God twice a day, in the Evening he called all his Family together, and repeated to them the heads of the Sermons, with some additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his own, which he fitted for their Capacities, after which, he constantly shut himself up for two or three hours, which he spent in his secret Devotions and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Meditations. Of which contemplations two Volumes in <hi>Octavo</hi> were printed a little before his Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1671. The Lord Chief Justice <hi>Keyling</hi> Dyed, and <hi>May</hi> the <hi>18th.</hi> He <note place="margin">Advancement.</note> was promoted to be the <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with the great Applause of the People. One thing was highly commended in him, that when there was a great ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in the Ability, and Learning of Counsellors that pleaded before him, he thought that it became him to enforce what the weaker Counsel managed but indifferently, not to suffer the more Learned to carry the business by the advantage they had over the other, by their quickness and skill in the Law, till all things were cleered, in which the merits and strength of the ill defended cause did lie.</p>
               <p>And in this Court did he spend the rest of his Publick Life and Imployment: But about four years and an half, after this advancement, he that had hitherto enjoyed a firm health, to which his great Temperance and equality of his Mind did much conduce, he on a suddain was brought very low by an Inflammation in his <hi>Midriff,</hi> which in two Days space brake the Constitution of his health, which he never after Recovered.</p>
               <p>And he became so <hi>Asthmatical,</hi> that he could not fetch his breath, without great difficulty, which determined in a Dropsy, of which he afterwards dyed. He had so <note place="margin">His Sickness.</note> much skill in <hi>Physick,</hi> that considering his age, he concluded that his disease must carry him off in a little time, and therefore he resolved to have some of his last Months to himself, that being freed of all worldly cares, he might be preparing for his change. Now the businesses of his Profession were become ungrateful to him, and he desired wholly to apply himself to better purposes, as appeared by a paper which he wrote on this Subject, which for brevity sake I omit.</p>
               <p>By this we may see that he continued in his Station upon no other consideration, but that being set in it by the Providence of God, he durst not leave the Post assigned him by God, without preferring his own inclination to the choise of God: But now that same Providence having by this great change dissenabled him to the execution of it, he was resolved to Resign it: Which so soon as his Friends discovered, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured all that possibly they could, to disswade him from it: But all in vain. For he applyed himself to the Kings Majesty for a <hi>Writ of Ease,</hi> which the King was very unwilling to grant, and offered to let him hold his Place, doing what business he could in his Chamber▪ But he sayd, he could not with a good Conscience continue it, not being able to discharge the duty belonging to it.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:62667:190"/>
               <p> At last having wearied himself and all his friends with his importunate desires, and growing sensibly weaker in his body, he died <hi>February 21th.</hi> 2675/6. Therefore before a <hi>Master of the Chancery,</hi> with a little Parchment Deed, and there Sealed, and Delivered it, acknowledging it to be Enrolled, and afterwards bringing the Original to the Lord Chancellor, formally surrendred his Office.</p>
               <p>He had the day before surrendred it to the King in Person, who heartily wished him the return of his Health, assuring him that he would still look upon him as one of his Judges, and would have his advice, and in the mean time would continue his <hi>Pension</hi> to him during his Life. The good man thought this bounty too great, and an ill Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the King, who yet ordered it to be paid Quarterly.</p>
               <p>When the first payment was received, he ordered a great part of it to charitable Uses saying he would do the like with the rest so long as he received it: And dying upon a Quarter day, some questioning whether that Quarter were due, the King decided the matter, and ordered it to be paid to his <hi>Executors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having left his place, he returned home with as much chearfulness as his want of health could admit, being eased of a burden which he had lately groaned under, and so was made more capable of enjoying that which he had much wished for, according to his Elegant Translation or <hi>Paraphrase</hi> of those excellent lines in <hi>Seneca's Thyestes.</hi>

               <p>Having now attained to that privacy which he had no less seriously, than piously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, he called all his Servants that had belonged to his Office, and told them that he had now laid down his Place, and so now their Imployments were at an end, advising them to provide for themselves, and gave to some of them very considerable rewards, and to every one of them a Token, and so dismissed all but his <hi>Domesticks.</hi> From <hi>February</hi> 15. he lived till the <hi>Christmas</hi> day following, but all the while in so ill a state of Health, that there was no hope of his recovery. Yet he continued still to retire often, both for his Devotions, and Studies, and when his infirmities so encreased that he could go no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he caused his Servants to carry him thither in a Chair.</p>
               <p>His Pains so encreased on him, that no strength inferior to his own could have born them: yet to the last he expressed a great submission to the Will of God: Desiring to <note place="margin">Patience.</note>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62667:191"/> with his eyes and hands lifted up, he was fixed in his Devotions.</p>
               <p>He had some secret Presages of his death, saying, that if he did not die on such a day, he should live a Month longer. He injoyed the free use of his Reason and Sense to the last minute, which he had often prayed for during his Sickness. He had for many years a particular devotion in Celebrating the day set a part to Commemorate <hi>Christs Nativity,</hi> and commonly Wrote a Paper of Verses in honor of his Saviour: Seventeen whereof were formerly Printed, and others not Printed before was this which follows, being a <hi>Paraphrase</hi> on <hi>Simeons Song.</hi>

               <p>And truly this day which he, with so much Spiritual Joy, had frequently spent, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the day of his <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and Deliverance. For between two and three a clock in the Afternoon of that Day, he breathed out his pious Soul. His end was Peace. He seemed not to be in any pangs in his last moments. He was interred in the Churchyard <note place="margin">His Death.</note> of <hi>Alderly</hi> among his Ancestors. He used to say, that Churches were for the Living, and Churchyards for the Dead.</p>
               <p>His Monument was plain, and decent, a black Marble Stone, upon which he ordered to be engraven this Inscription.</p>

               </q>
               <p>His <hi>Motto</hi> was, <hi>Festina Lentè,</hi> which he ordered to be engraven upon the head of his <note place="margin">His Motto and Character.</note>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:62667:191"/> Walking-staff, and often heard to say, that he found many Witty men to run into great Errors, because they did not give themselves time to <hi>think:</hi> But the heat of imagination making some Notions to appear in good colours to them, they without staying till that cooled, were violently led by the impulses it made upon them; whereas calm and slow men, who pass for <hi>Dullards</hi> in the common estimation, could search after <hi>Truth</hi> and find it out, as with more deliberation, so with greater certainty.</p>
               <p>He laid aside the tenth Penny of all he got, for the Poor, and took great care to be <note place="margin">Charity.</note> well informed of proper Objects for his Charity. And when he was made a Judge, many of the <hi>Perquisites</hi> which belonged to his Place, as his <hi>Divident of the Rules, and Box mony,</hi> he sent to the Jayl to discharge poor Prisoners, who never knew from whence their relief came.</p>
               <p>It's a custom for the Marshal of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> to present the Judges of that Court with a piece of Plate for a <hi>New years-gift,</hi> that for the <hi>chief Justice</hi> being larger than the rest: This he intended to have refused; But the other Judges told him, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his Office, and that his refusing of it would be prejudicial to his Successors: So he resolved to take it; but sent word to the Marshal, that instead of the Plate he should bring him the value of it in money, which so soon as he received, he sent it to the Prisons for the relief and discharge of the poor there.</p>
               <p>He usually invited his poor Neighbours to Dine with him, and made them to sit at his own Table: And if any of them were sick that they could not come, he would send them warm meat from his own Table. And did not only relieve the poor of his own Parish, but sent supplies to the neighbouring Parishes, as there was occasion for it: And he treated them all with the tenderness, and familiarity that became one, who consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they were of the same Nature with himself, and were reduced to no other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, but such as himself might be brought unto.</p>
               <p>For common Beggars, if any such came unto him as he was in his Walks, when he was in the Country, he would ask such of them as were capable of working, why they went about so idly? If they answered, because they could get no work, he would send them to some Field to gather Stones, and lay them on heaps, and then would pay them liberally for their pains, and would afterwards send his Carts to carry them into such places in the Highways which most needed mending.</p>
               <p>When he was in the City he liberally extended his Charity, even unto street Beggars, and when some told him, that thereby he encouraged Idleness, and that most of them were notorious Cheats, his Answer was: That he believed most of them to be such; But among there were some that were great Objects of Charity, and prest with grievous necessities; and that he had rather to give his Alms to twenty that might haply be Rogues, than one of the other sort should perish for want of the small relief he gave them.</p>
               <p>He was a merciful Landlord to all his Tenants, and was ever ready, upon just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, <note place="margin">A good Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord.</note> to abate their Rents: and a poor Widdow that lived in <hi>London,</hi> and had a small Estate, near his Land in the Country, from which her Rent was ill paid, and with some charge returned to her, she bemoneing her Case to him, he ordered his Bailiff to receive it, and to return it for her without any such charge. And when there was a general falling of Rents, and of hers among others, he would have this abatement to lie upon him, and so she had her full Rent as formerly.</p>
               <p>His Justice did notably appear in this, that when any ill money was put into his <note place="margin">Justice.</note> hands, he would never suffer it to be put off, judging that would be no excuse to him to put off false money to others, because some had so deluded him. He had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered much of this together: For many had so abused his goodness, as to mix corrupt money in the Fees which they gave him. Probably he had intended to destroy it: But some that had seen that great heap, brake into his Chamber, and stole it, which he used to speak of with some pleasure, conceiting how the Couzeners were couzened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>When he was made a Judge, he would ever pay more for his purchases, and other <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> commodities than they were prized at: and being told that he made ill Bargains, he answered, that it became Judges to pay more for what they bought than the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, that so those with whom they dealt, might not think that they had any right to their favour, by having sold them such good Penny worths.</p>
               <p>How little minded to raise to himself a great Estate, may appear by this: whereas, at the first he had a hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> he never advanced it to nine hundred <hi>per</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62667:192"/>
                  <hi>annum:</hi> which, considering the great practice he had whilst a Counsellor, and his constant frugal, and retired way of living, was but a small Fortune: and of this a very considerable part came in by his share in Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> Estate, who had made him one of his Executors.</p>
               <p>He valued Books, and <hi>Manuscripts</hi> above all things in the world: and himself had made a great, and rare Collection of <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> belonging to the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> He was Forty years in gathering them, and they cost him about fifteen hundred pounds. These all he left to <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> where had most of his Education. <note place="margin">Liberality.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus Mastered things without him, his next care was to overcome his own <note place="margin">Piety.</note> corrupt inclination. He was (as he said) naturally passionate; yet this appeared not to any about him, save only at some times his Colour would rise a little: But he so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned himself, that those that lived long with him, never saw him disordered with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, though he met with some great Trials of his patience, which the nature of man is <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> as little able to bear as any whatsoever.</p>
               <p>One that had done him a very great injury, some time after came to him for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <note place="margin">Forbearance.</note> about setling his Estate: And he gave it him very freely, and would take no Fec of him for the same; and thereby shewed, both that he could forgive as a Christian, and that he had the Soul of a Gentleman in him, not to take money of one that had wronged him so hainously: and being asked, how he could use a man so kindly, that had wronged him so much? His Answer was, he thanked God that had taught him to forget injuries.</p>
               <p>In his Family he was a very gentle Master. He was tender of all his Servants; <note place="margin">Family Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> he never turned any away except they were so faulty, that there was no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming them. When any of them had been long out of the way, or had neglected any part of their duty, he would not see them at their first coming home, or till the next day, lest when his displeasure was quick, he should chide them undecently. And when he did reprove them, he did it with that sweetness and gravity, that it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was more concerned that they had done evil, than for the offence given by it to himself: But if any were immoral, or unruly, he then turned them away, saying, that he, who by his Place ought to punish disorders in others, must by no means suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them in his own Family. He advanced his Servants, according to the time they had been about him, and never gave occasion of envy among them, by raising the younger Clerks above those that had been longer with him. He treated them all with great affection, rather as a Friend than a Master, frequently giving them good instructions. Such of them as had more profitable places under him, he caused to give some of their profit to such as had no more than their Wages. In his Will he left Legacies to every of them; and one of them, in whom he put much Confidence, he made him one of his Executors.</p>
               <p>He was of a most tender, and compassionate nature, which evidently appeared in his <note place="margin">Compassion.</note> Trials, and passing Sentence upon Criminals, in which he was very careful, that not a circumstance should be neglected, which might any way clear the fact. He behaved himself with that regard to the Prisoners, as became, both the gravity of a Judge, and the Pity which was due to men, whose lives lay at the stake, and no jeering or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme severity fell from him. He took care that Witnesses should be put under no confusion that might disorder their memories. When he came to give Sentence, he did it with that composedness and decency, and his Speeches to the Prisoners to prepare them for Death, were so weighty, so free from all Affectation, and so seriously devout, that many were much edified by his Speeches, and behaviour therein.</p>
               <p>The passing of this Sentence of Death, was the most against the grain of all his Imployments, yet therein could he never be mollified to any tenderness which might hinder Justice. His Mercifulness extended even to his Beasts. When his Horses which had done him much service were grown old, he would not suffer them to be sold, or put to any hard labour; and he used his old Dogs with the same care.</p>
               <p>He was a great encourager of young Persons that diligently applied themselves to their Books, and would give them directions about the method of their studies, with much humanity and sweetness, and with smiling and pleasant ways he would admonish them, if he saw any thing amiss in them. As if they were too fine in their Cloths. He disliked to see young students to wear long Perukes, or for Atturnies to wear Swords.</p>
               <p>He was very free, and communicative in his discourse, which mostly fixed upon some good and useful subject, and loved for an hour or two at Night to be visited by his friends,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62667:192"/> and herein he used a simplicity that was both natural to himself and very easie to others. He never studied <hi>Modes</hi> of Courtship, yet he knew not what it was to be rude, or harsh with any, unless he were impertinently addressed to in matters of Justice. For then he would raise his voice a little, and so shake off those importunities.</p>
               <p>In his Furniture, and Service at his table, he liked the old plainess so well, that as he would introduce no new fashions, so he rather affected a coursness in the use of the Old, which was more the effect of his Philosophy, than that of his disposition. For at first he loved finery too much. He was always of an equal temper, rather cheerful than merry. Many wondred to see the evenness of his Deportment in some sad passages of this Life.</p>
               <p>Having lost one of his Sons, the manner of whose death had some grievous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances attending it, a Friend coming to see him, and to condole his loss, He said to him, those were the effects of living long: For such must look to see many sad, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable things; and having said that, he went to other discourses with his ordinary freedom of mind. For he gave no occasion by idleness to <hi>melancholy,</hi> to corrupt his Spirit; but by the perpetual bent of his thoughts, he knew well how to divert them from being oppressed with the excess of Sorrow.</p>
               <p>He had a generous and noble <hi>Idea</hi> of God in his mind, and this he did find, above all other considerations to preserve his quiet. And indeed that was so well established in him, that no accidents, how suddain soever, were observed to discompose him.</p>
               <p>He would never Discourse of publick matters in his private Conversation. But in Questions of Law, when any young Lawyer put a Case to him, he was very Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative, especially whilst he was at the Bar: But when he was promoted to the Bench, he grew more reserved, and would never suffer his opinion in any Case to be known, till he was obliged to declare it judicially. And he concealed his opinion in great Cases so carefully, that the rest of the Judges in the same Court could never perceive it. His reason was, because every Judge ought to give Sentence according to his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion and Conscience, and not to be swayed by any respect of another mans opinion. And by this means it hath faln out, that when all the <hi>Barons of the Exchequer,</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their Opinions, and agreed in their Reasons and Arguments, yet he coming to speak last, and differing in Judgment from them, hath exprest himself with so much weight and solidity, that the <hi>Barons</hi> have immediately retracted their Votes, and concurr'd with him.</p>
               <p>He hath sat as a Judge in all the Courts of Law, and in two of them as Chief; but still, wherever he sat, all businesses of consequence followed him, and no man was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to sit down by the Judgment of any other Court, till the Case were brought before him to see whether he were of the same mind. And his Opinion being once known, all did readily acquiesce in it: And it was rarely seen that any attempted to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout again; and if any did it, he was lookt upon as a very contentious person.</p>
               <p>Nor was his Opinion and Judgment Reverenced in Courts of Law only: But his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was Great in Courts of Equity also, and the same respect and submission was paid to him there too: And this appeared not only in his own Court of Equity, in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> Chamber, but in the <hi>Chancery</hi> too, for thither he was often called to advise and assist the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> or Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> for the time being; and if the Cause were of difficult Examination, or intricated, and entangled with variety of Settlements, no man shewed a more cleer and discerning Judgment. If it were of a great value, and Great Persons interressed in it, no man ever shewed greater Courage and Integrity, in laying aside all respect of persons.</p>
               <p>When he came to deliver his Opinion, he alwayes put his Discourse into such a method, that one part of it gave light to another; and where the proceedings in <hi>Chancery</hi> might prove inconvenient to the Subject, he never spared to observe, and reprove them. And from his Observations, and Discourses, the <hi>Chancery</hi> hath taken occasion to establish those Rules, by which it governs it self at this day.</p>
               <p>He did look upon Equity as a part of the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and one of the Grounds of it: and therefore as near as he could, he did always reduce it to certain Rules and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that men might study it as a <hi>Science,</hi> and not think that the Administration of it, had any thing Arbitrary in it. Thus Eminent was this worthy man in every Station; and into what Court soever he was called, he quickly made it appear, that he deserved the chief Seat there.</p>
               <p>As Great a Lawyer as he was, he would never suffer the strictness of the Law to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62667:193"/> prevail against Conscience: As Great a Chancellor as he was, he would make use of all the niceties and subtilties in Law, when it tended to support Right, and Equity. But nothing was more admirable in him than his patience. He did not affect the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of quickness and dispatch, by an hasty, and captious hearing of the Counsel. He would bear with the meanest, and gave every man his full scope, thinking it much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to lose time than patience. In summing up of an Evidence to a Jury, he would always require the Bar to interrupt him if he did mistake, and to put him in mind of it, if he did forget the least Circumstance. Some Judges have been disturbed at this as a rudeness, which he alwayes looked upon as a service, and respect done unto him.</p>
               <p>His whole Life was nothing else but a continued course of Labour and Industry: And when he could borrow any time from the publick Service, it was wholly imployed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Philosophical</hi> or <hi>Divine</hi> Meditations; and even that was publick Service too as it hath proved, For they have occasioned his Writing of such Treatises as are become the choicest entertaiment of wise and good men.</p>
               <p>He that considers the Active part of his Life, and with what unwearied diligence and application of mind he dispatched all mens business which came under his Care, may justly wonder how he coul find any time for Contemplation. Again, he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders the various studies he past through, and the many Collections and Observations he hath made, may as justly wonder how he could find any time for Action. But no man can wonder at the Exemplary Piety and Innocence of such a Life, so spent as his was; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as he was careful to avoid every idle word, so it appears that he never spent an idle day. But men who despair of attaining such perfection, are not willing to believe that any man else did ever arrive at such an heigth.</p>
               <p>He was the Greatest Lawyer of the Age wherein he lived, and might have had what Practice he pleased: But though he did most Conscientiously affect the Labour of his Profession, yet at the same time he despised the gain of it. He took more pains to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Honours, and preferments of the Gown, than others do to obtain them. His modesty was beyond all Example: He was the most obliging man that ever practised. If a young Gentleman happ'ned to be retained to Argue a Point in Law, where he was on the contrary side, he would often mind the Objections, when he came to repeat them, and would always commend the Gentleman if there were room for it; and one good word of his Mouth was of more advantage to a young man, than all the favour of the Court could be.</p>
               <p>He was twice Married. His first Wife was <hi>Ann,</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>Henry Moor</hi> of <hi>Faly</hi> in <hi>Berk-shire;</hi> by her he had ten Children, whereof the four first died young, the rest liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be all Married, yet he outlived them all, except his Eldest Daughter, and his young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Son. His second Wife was <hi>Ann,</hi> the Daughter of Mr. <hi>Joseph Bishop</hi> of <hi>Faly</hi> in <hi>Berk-shire,</hi> by whom he had no Children. In his Will he gave her a great Character, as a most dutiful, faithful and Loving Wife, to whose care he committed the breeding of his Grand-Children, and left her one of his Executors.</p>

               <div type="biography">
                  <head>
                     <hi>The Life and Death of Mrs.</hi> Mary Gunter, <hi>who died about the year,</hi> 1633.</head>
                  <p>MRS. <hi>Mary Gunter</hi> was by Birth a Gentlewoman, but descended of <hi>Popish</hi> Parents, who dying in her infancy, she was committed to the Tuition of an old Lady, honourable for her place, but a strong <hi>Papist,</hi> who nursed this Orphan in <hi>Popery</hi> till she came to be about fourteen years of Age: At which time this Lady dying, it pleased God (who had a merciful purpose towards her Conversion) by his good Providence, that she was brought into the Family, and service of that Religious, and truly Honou-Lady, <hi>Leitice,</hi> Countess of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who entertained her with more than ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, both because of her young and tender years, as also because she was allied unto Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> then Husband to this honourable Countess, at whose request, this Lady had taken her into her care.</p>
                  <p>To this honourable Countess she came a most zealous <hi>Papist</hi> (according to princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of her Education) and was resolved, so soon as possibly she could meet with a fit opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tunity, to convey her self beyond the Seas, to become a <hi>Nun.</hi> For she then thought that that was the surest, and most likely way to get to Heaven; which, as she had an earnest desire to attain, so she would take the neerest way, which she thought would bring her thither.</p>
                  <p>But she could not so closely carry on her secret devotions or intentions, but that by the vigilant, and careful eye of that Honourable Lady, they were soon discovered, and not sooner discovered than wisely prevented. For presently her Lady took from her all her <hi>Popish</hi> Books, Beads, and Images, and all such Trumpery, and set a narrow Watch over
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62667:194"/> her, that she might be kept from her <hi>Popish</hi> Prayers, and not absent her self from the daily Prayers used in the Family, which were constantly and Religiously observed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Farther also she required her to read those Prayers which her Honour daily used to have in her private Chamber with her Women.</p>
                  <p>Her Ladiship also carefully prevented her meeting with any of her <hi>Popish Companiens,</hi> or intercourse with them by Letters, not suffering her either to Write or Receive any Letter without the view or consent of her Honour.</p>
                  <p>She also caused her to give an account of the Sermons, which were Preached in the Family, which were constantly two every <hi>Lords day,</hi> that thereby she might attain to sound knowledge, which is the great Hammer to beat down, and enervate <hi>Popery.</hi> And it pleased God so to bless these means in a short time, that she became helpful unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by Communicating to them the substance of those Sermons which she heard; and she had the greater opportunity to do this, because it was constantly observed by all the Women in that honourable Family, to come together after the Evening Sermon, and to improve their time by repeating both Sermons.</p>
                  <p>But all this she as yet did out of fear, keeping still this reserve that she would devote her heart to <hi>Popery,</hi> and (as <hi>Naaman)</hi> trusted that God would be merciful, because she did all through fear, and constraint. But God (who in his own due time, and by his own means) bringeth about his own purposes, began to work in her a staggering first, about her former old way. For when she saw, and observed the grave and holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation of that Reverend man of God, who then was Chaplain to the Countess [Mr. <hi>J. W.]</hi> she began to apprehend and perswade her self, that surely this mans god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness must needs bring him to Heaven: And hereupon, the Reverend respect which she did now bear to the man, made her to lend a better ear, and give more heed to his Doctrine, to examine his proofs, and to reverence his Ministry, whereby (in a short time) she came to embrace the Truth in the Love of it, and to renounce her former su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, and to bewail her ignorance.</p>
                  <p>And, as it is the property of a true Convert, being Converted her self, she much endeavoured the Conversion of others, and was a great help, and furtherance to the publick Ministry, in her place and station. And this was a thing which that hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Family took special notice of, and there were many that had great cause to bless God for her, for the benefit which they received by her.</p>
                  <p>But presently after Satan (that subtile Serpent that watcheth to devour every man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child that is born unto God) began to rage, and roar upon her, by strong, and Hellish temptations: First, terrifying her with an apprehension that she had committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, having been a deep dissembler; For that, having been in heart a <hi>Papist,</hi> yet had she joyned in worship with the <hi>Protestants</hi> whom she held to be <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and did all this against her knowledge and conscience: And so incessantly, and violently did he pursue her with this Temptation, that she was brought to believe that it was impossible that this sin should, or could be pardoned. And this Temptation was edged and sharpened with that foul and unnatural suggestion of making away her self by murther; as if the remedy of the sin against the Holy Ghost, were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy ones self.</p>
                  <p>While she was tossed and molested long with this Satanical suggestion, she (by conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her grief) was brought so low, by bodily distempers, that she almost despaired of recovery. But in the nick of time, it pleased God to direct that Reverend Minister (who was her Father in <hi>Christ,</hi> and whom she ever after embraced with the most intire Love of the most natural Child) to discourse, and treat of this sin, and to shew what it was, and by whom, and in what manner it was committed. To this Doctrine she attended with great diligence, and by examining it, and comparing her self and her own condition with what she had heard of it, and finding that she had not so sinned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter illumination, nor with obstinate malice against God and his Truth (for that was it, when she was most superstitiously devoted, she desired to find out) it pleased God to calm and quiet her mind for that, and so freed her from that Temptation.</p>
                  <p>But Satan (who departed from our Head, the <hi>Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> only for a season) was not long absent before he again set upon her with new suggestions, and upon his return brought with him seven other spirits (if it were possible) worse than himself, and now his name might fitly by called <hi>Legion.</hi> For now he cast other <hi>siery Darts</hi> at her, to confound and destroy her: And this he endeavoured by injecting multitudes of blasphemous thoughts into her head. For now she must believe that there is no God:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62667:194"/> That the sacred Scriptures are not the Word of God, but a humane policy to keep men in order: Or if it were Gods Word, who must interpret it? Or how could she, a silly woman, get the understanding of such deep Mysteries as were contained in the same? Besides, as she was of mind that she was gotten out of one Error, so she knew nothing but that she was misled into another? For how could she be assured that this was the Truth which she now embraced, and professed, seeing there are as many, or more Learned men of the one Opinion as of the other; and all of them defend, and maintain their Opinions by the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>Thus was she vexed and molested with Armies of roving, and unsetled conceits for the space of five, or six years together, till God (whom she often implored and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned by fervent prayer, for direction and assistance in the Combate brought her to this resolution, that she would hold these Conclusions whatsoever Disputes Satan might vex and weary her withal.</p>
                  <p>1. That there was, not only a God in himself, but a God that was her God: 2ly. That whatsoever Opinions there were in the World, that yet there was but one <hi>Truth,</hi> and that was to be Learned out of the Scriptures: And that, though there was much in the <hi>Bible</hi> which she did not understand, yet she was perswaded, that if she would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently read, and search the Scriptures, with earnest prayer unto God for a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in them, she should attain thereby, such a measure of knowledge, as would be sufficient to bring her to Heaven. And holding strongly to these grounds, she found her Temptations to vanish and wear away by degrees, and was her self daily more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and setled upon the foundation.</p>
                  <p>Neither was she only (through Gods Grace,) a Conqueror over these Temptations; but (as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>more than a Conqueror</hi> by them. For God (who bringeth Light out of darkness) made these Temptations a sweet seasoning of her; by occasion whereof, she tied her self to an exact▪ and strict course of godliness, and to the constant practice of Christian duties, which she religiously observed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed even till her dying day.</p>
                  <p>For first, That she might be established in the Truth, and confirmed against her former waverings, and weaknesses, she resolved that (God assisting her) she would every year read overy the whole <hi>Bible</hi> in an orderly course, which course she constantly observed for the space of fifteen years together, beginning her task upon her <hi>Birth day,</hi> and reading every day so many Chapters as to bring it about just with the year: By which exercise she gained a great encrease and measure of knowledge, and no less strengthening of her Faith. For she did not read carelesly and negligently, but always kept a Note of such Places as she did not understand; and would be still enquiring after the meaning of them, as she met, either with Ministers, or with other understanding Christians, who as she thought, were able to help her therein. And her custom was, ever before she opened her <hi>Bible,</hi> to direct, and send up a short Prayer unto God for the opening of her blind eyes to the understanding of those sacred Mysteries, that they might be as a <hi>Lamp</hi> to guide her feet in the ways of holiness, until she should attain the end of her Hope, and Faith, even <hi>the salvation of her Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet not herewith content, as a good <hi>Mary,</hi> she pondred the good Word of God in her heart. For by her great industry in the Scriptures, she had gotten by heart ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Select Chapters, and more of the <hi>Psalms:</hi> and in every Book of the Scripture one choice Verse; all which she repeated every week in a method and order which she had propounded to her self. And being asked, why she took so much pains in getting and retaining those Scriptures in memory? Her Answer was, that she knew not what dayes and times of Trial, and Persecutions might come, wherein she might be deprived of her <hi>Bible,</hi> and other good Books and helps; But so much of the Scriptures as she could get into her heart, she knew that no Tyrant, or Enemy could bereave, or rob her of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. For that time of her trouble, she resolved upon <hi>Daniels</hi> Practice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she was constant also; namely, that besides Family duties, which were performed twice every day, by the Chaplain in the Religious house in which she lived, till within one year of her death: And besides the private Prayers which she daily read in her Ladies Bed-Chamber, she was thrice on her Knees every day before God in secret, like a true worshipper, whose delight was frequently to present her self before the Lord: And by means of this days exercise (besides all other comfortable fruits) she attained to a singular sweet gift in prayer, whereby she could both strongly wrestle, and happily
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62667:195"/> prevail with God, whose gracious disposition inclines him to be prevailed with, yea, to be overcome by the Prayers of his weak Servants.</p>
                  <p>She also knowing that religious <hi>fasting,</hi> is the Whetstone of Prayer, she tied her self to set apart six dayes in every year, wherein she did in an extraordinary manner humble her self before God by fasting and prayer for her own sins, and for the sins of the times wherein she lived. At all which times she was in a special manner earnest with the Lord, that he would be pleased farther to reveal his whole Truth, needful for her Salvation, and keep her constant in the Obedience thereof unto the end.</p>
                  <p>And because she knew that the right and worthy receiving of the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> did afford to a Christian some special strength, and much stability in the course of Godliness; as she diligently laid hold on every opportunity, wherein she might partake thereof; so for many years she laid a bond upon her self never to receive it, but the day before, to sit, and examine her self seriously, and deeply to humble her self before the Lord in <hi>fasting and prayer</hi> all the day long.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. The troubles of her Conscience made her ever of a tender Conscience, so that she was ever fearful of offending God and her own Conscience, for which end she always kept a strict and narrow watch over her heart. And to keep her self in the greater awe, for the space of about five years before her death, she kept a <hi>Catalogue</hi> or <hi>Register</hi> of her daily slips, yea, she set down the naughty thoughts which she observed in her self, that one day in every Week she might extraordinarily humble her self for all the failings of that Week; and at such times her abstinence was more than ordinary, using only so much food as might best fit her weak body to humble and fervent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. All these private duties of Religion were carried on with so much fervency, that none in the family, besides her bosom friend, knew of their performance.</p>
                  <p>And as she was fearful of sins present and to come, so was her Conscience as tender in respect of sins past, as will appear by this memorable instance. Whilst she was a Child, bred up in the Family of that afore-mentioned old Lady, she was enticed by some lewd Servants, who fed her with Figs, and such other Toys, fit to please Children withal, to steal for them money out of her Ladies Cabinet, which often stood open in her Chamber, and which they knew, she of all others had the fittest opportunities to do: And her childishness giving way to these enticements, she found that it was not missed, and therefore was encouraged to continue it, for about the space of seven years, without any great check of Conscience: But when the Light of Gods Word shone into her soul, and made a privy discovery of the secrets of her heart, and thereby made her able to take her self with the Fact; Now she was ashamed and confounded in her self, and her awaken'd Conscience gave her no rest; neither could she concieve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope of quiet, because she saw that she had done that which she could no way undo.</p>
                  <p>When she looked at the Sums of money taken by her, and given to those wicked Enticers, she conceived that by continuing in that course, for so many years together, she might have wronged that Lady of Thirty, or Forty pounds. If she thought of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Restitution, she was no way able to do it. And thus she groaned under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of this sin for a long time, easing it as well as she could, by taking up a firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, that if God pleased ever to make her able, she would make full Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Heirs of the deceased Lady, which afterwards she did accordingly.</p>
                  <p>For when that honourable Lady, whom she had long served, at the time of her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, gave her a large and bountiful Portion, she soon after made choice of a Reverend Minister, to whom she enjoyned secrecy; and because she would be sure to make full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, she delivered to him Threescore pounds to make tender of it to the Ladies heir, as from a concealed Servant of the Ladies, who had unjustly taken it away from her. And when the Gentleman returned Ten pounds of it again, such was the tenderness of her Conscience, that she would receive none of it to her own use, but gave it away to the poor, and pious uses. And this childish miscarriage God turned to her good. For in all the two and twenty years service to that honourable Lady, she never made use of any thing which was under her charge, whether small or great, but she set it down in Writing, and once every day did make it good, either in the very kind, or in some other thing which she bought for her Ladiships use.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. The sense of her own weaknesses and wants made her of a pitiful and charitable disposition towards the wants and miseries of others. She had ever a very large heart to the poor, especially to the <hi>godly poor.</hi> She did never see or hear of any
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62667:195"/> that were in want, but her heart did mourn if she had not wherewithal to relieve them▪ Neither yet was her hand shut; for she did yearly lay aside a portion of mony, to the uttermost of her ability (if not beyond it) for their relief. Thus she lived, and therefore happily, and desiredly. Neither could so gracious a Life be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by an answerable, that is, a happy death and dissolution, which accordingly, through Gods mercy, she attained.</p>
                  <p>True it is that the Life of a Christian should be a continual meditation of death, as it is a continual motion towards Death. And such was the latter part especially of the Life of this gracious woman, who was of a weak and sickly constitution for many years before her death, which made her the more and better prepared for her last combate and sickness, which continued for the space of ten Weeks; in all which time she certainly apprehended, and expected her approaching dissolution, it being the principal, and almost only subject of her discourses, for six Months before it came to pass. But Thirty days before her departure, she finding her pains increasing and growing very sharp and tedious, she spent an hours discourse with her Husband, concerning her desire about the things of this Life. And having imparted to him what she purposed, she thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded her Speech. <hi>And now sweet-heart, no more words between you and me about any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, only let me earnestly request you, and charge you, that as you see my weaknesses to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, you will not fail to assist me, and to call upon me to follow the Lord with prayer and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. For now, I know, that Satan will shew all his malice, because his time is but short a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, and he will easily espy my weakness, and make his advantage of it; and therefore now especially help me with your counsel, comfort, and prayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all the time of her sickness, her gracious God, who, as a fast friend, standeth close to his Servants, when they have need of him, shewed his merciful presence with her, as in all other comfortable supplies, answerable to the depth of her distress, so especially in hearing, and answering her prayers, and desires of her heart. For</p>
                  <p>There were four things, which in her prayers, she especially begged of God, in the time of her sickness, and in none of them was she denied.</p>
                  <p>First: That she might be armed with strength against Satans assaults, and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which she expected would be very fierce and frequent: From whom (according to her request) she was mercifully freed. Only about three days before her death, she began to be dejected in the sight and sense of her present dulness, and hereupon began to call in question, the love of God towards her, and the truth of Gods Grace in her. For (said she) were I the Lords, why should not I now lift up my head with Joy, seeing the time of my dissolution draweth on so near?</p>
                  <p>But, through Gods mercy, these complaints continued not above six hours, before she had much comfort and chearfulness again, which she expressed in earnest and excellent prayers (wherein her Gift was more than ordinary for her Sex) as also in many hearty and chearful Praises, and Thanksgivings unto God for his great mercy, in that he had so chained up Satan, at this time of her great weakness; whereas she had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly molested, and daily vexed with his <hi>Buffetings, and fiery Darts,</hi> for above the space of six years together; yet now, God would not suffer him to spit out his malice against her for above the space of six hours.</p>
                  <p>Her second request was, that the Lord would support and strengthen her, patiently to endure, and cheerfully to undergo all the pains he should lay upon her, even to the end. And herein also was she graciously heard, as well as in the former. For though she was full of great pains, and endured many strong fits, in which no part of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was exempted from racking, and deadly torments, and every of these fits conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for many hours, yet was she never heard to utter any impatient word concerning her self, or of discontent to any that were imployed about her: Much less did she charge God foolishly, in whose hands she judged her self to be, as the Clay in the hands of the Potter.</p>
                  <p>Her third request to God was, that she might in all her sorrows be supported with some sense and evidence of his Love, and with the assurance of the pardon of all her sins. And that God was comfortably found of her in this request, also was very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in her joyful expectation of death, the time whereof she truly foretold five days before it came to pass: And as this time approached, her Joy encreased, so as she was able to comfort her mournful Husband and Friends, saying: <hi>Mourn not for me, but for your selves: For I shall very shortly be more happy than the wishes of your hearts can make</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:62667:196"/>
                     <hi>me; and therefore cease your mourning, and help me thither by you prayers as fast as you can.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her fourth and last request was, that she might have her memory continued to her until the last period of her life, that so by no idle or light speech, she might dishonour God, or bring a scandal upon her profession. For she said, <hi>If I through pain, or want of Sleep</hi> (which indeed she much wanted) <hi>should have any foolish, or idle talk, I know what the Speech of the world useth to be. This is the end of all your precise Folks, they die mad, or not themselves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And as the prayed, God gave her her memory to the last gasp, so that she died pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For a little before her departure, she called her Husband, and her Friends that were about her, and hasted them to prayer: For now (said she) <hi>I shall be gone presently</hi> (which words they then believed not) but prayer being ended, she said with more strength than she had spoken any thing for four hours before, <hi>Amen, Amen, Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit, Lord Jesus have mercy on me, and receive my Soul.</hi> And thus with her breath and words, she breathed out her soul, which by the Angels was carried into <hi>Abrahams bosom</hi> in the highest Heavens, to which her eyes and hands were lifted up. About the year of our Lord, 1633.</p>

                     <hi>The Life and Death of the Lady</hi> Alice Lucy, <hi>who Died,</hi> Anno Christi 1648.</head>
                  <p>HEr Birth was none of hers, and therefore cannot be either her vertue or her praise. High descent, and glorious Names, far fetcht, are but <hi>Names;</hi> and the Names of others too<hi>—Vix ea nostra voco.</hi> Scarcely can we call <hi>ours</hi> what our selves are not the Authors of. And, not many Generations, and a multitude of mouldy sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but Virtue only gives the Character of true Nobility, as some of the Heathen hath said: How far then should Christians be from committing of Idolatry with Stocks, and worshipping of Images! Ascribing so much to Families, and esteeming themselves or others truly Noble, if their Progenitors have been so. Nobility is not <hi>Hereditary,</hi> but <hi>Inherent;</hi> not <hi>Relative</hi> and transmitted, but <hi>Moral,</hi> and <hi>Personal;</hi> or at least, not so much: Though we are very apt to give much honour to the very shadow of Nobility. But when to the shadow there is added the substance; Nobility <hi>Inherent</hi> to Nobility <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,</hi> there truly we owe a debt of double honor. And such a debt was due to this noble Lady, so conspicuous in both.</p>
                  <p>Her entrance was early into the <hi>Conjugal</hi> State and Condition (such Fruit so rare, so <note place="margin">Her Marriage.</note> soon ripe, could not continue long ungathered) yet not sooner than she was fit for it. She knew that her taking of a <hi>second self,</hi> was a self-denying work; and therefore she resigned both her <hi>reason,</hi> and her <hi>will</hi> unto her <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Husband;</hi> to whom she was, <note place="margin">Her Humility.</note> as <hi>Monica,</hi> the Mother of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> was to her Husband <hi>Patricius,</hi> Reverently ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and admirable: And from whom, for all the Virtues which an Husband can <note place="margin">A good Wife.</note> wish for in his Wife, she received as much honor as she could expect, or desire.</p>
                  <p>After they had drawn together in one yoke for about the space of Thirty years, <note place="margin">Her Husband, Sir <hi>T Lucy</hi> of <hi>Charlcot,</hi> dies.</note> with much mutual dearness, and delight, it pleased God to dissolve the Knot; by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away her support and honour, far dearer to her than her very Life. But then it pleased God also, to shew himself abundantly gracious unto her. For when he had made her a <hi>Widdow,</hi> he made himself her <hi>Husband;</hi> supporting her, comforting her, and enabling her prudently to mannage her great Estate, and to order her numerous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, with so much Wisdom as was admirable; especially if we consider that her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <note place="margin">Her Prudence.</note> infirmities did most commonly confine her to her Chamber, and seldom permitted her to stir abroad. Its no wonder that the <hi>Turkish Bassa's,</hi> and Privy Counsellors carry themselves so regularly and exactly towards him, though he never come amongst them: For he hath his <hi>dangerous Window</hi> (as 'tis called) where he can hear their Words,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62667:196"/> and see and observe all their behaviour, though none of them can see him: And won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful it was that all in so great a Family as this Ladies, should be so regular, so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <note place="margin">Good Servants.</note> in their places, so faithful to her, who, as she scarce ever came among them, so had no Window through which she might over-look them. <hi>Gods Wisdom is every where visible, though himself be not:</hi> So her Influence extended to all her affairs, though her self were so retired.</p>
                  <p>She continually carried about her the burthen of a weak body; but she did hear <note place="margin">Her great weakness.</note> it with singular Patience, and improved it to her spiritual advantage. <hi>Its a blessed weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which causeth us to make God our strength: A blessed Consinement, which sets the soul at liberty, and set it a longing after more Communion with God.</hi> Her great affliction it was that she could not visit the house of God and attend upon the Publick Ordinances, where God hath promised his presence, and where we may expect his blessing What many in those giddy days departed from, she most earnestly desired to repair to, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy: But because she could not go from her house to Gods house, she made a Church of her house, where for sundry years, she every <hi>Lords day</hi> in the Evening (unless she <note place="margin">Her Piety.</note> were hindred by extroardinary weakness) heard the Preaching of the Word; strictly requiring the presence of all her Family, and shewing her self an example of great reverence, and singular attention.</p>
                  <p>It was observed that she never removed out of one Room into an other, but she <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> used some short <hi>Ejaculations,</hi> with lifting up her Eyes and hands to God.</p>
                  <p>Her first imployment every day, was her humble Addresses to Almighty God in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: <note place="margin">Secret duties.</note> Her next was to read some part of Gods Word, and of other good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Books: And indeed she had a great Library, well stored with most of our choice <hi>English</hi> Authors. No sooner could she hear of any pious Book made publick, but she endeavoured to make it hers, and her self the better for and by it.</p>
                  <p>Much she was in reading, and able to give as good an account of what she read as <note place="margin">Children well Educated.</note> most are: She had an excellent understanding, as in <hi>secular</hi> so in <hi>spiritual</hi> things. And finding the benefit of this course, and practice to her self, she commended it to her Children, whom she caused, every day to read some Portions, both of the <hi>Old and New Testament</hi> in her own presence and hearing. In the Afternoon she spent some time in the same manner as she had done in the Morning.</p>
                  <p>About an hour before Supper, she appointed some one of her Children to read some godly and useful Sermon in the presence of her self and of her other Children: Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taking occasion of instilling into them some sweet and profitable Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of exhorting them to a constant religious walking with God. In the Evening a little before she betook her self to repose, she commanded them all to come into her Lodgings, where they joyned in singing of a <hi>Psalm</hi> (as the Servants did also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly after Supper, before they rose from the Table; the men-servants in the Hall, and the Maid Servants in a more private Room) And whence, after many pious Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and her Motherly <hi>Benediction,</hi> she dismissed them: And then closed the day, with secret duties, as she began it; begging Gods blessing upon her self: And thus she did constantly every day.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been said, we may observe that she was of a precious, and gracious spirit her self, and as careful to leave such holy and gracious impressions upon her Children after her. A very <hi>Fruitful Vine</hi> she was, and many were her <hi>Olive Plants</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Her fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> about her Table. Some of them tasted of death before their dear Mother, yet she left Ten living after her; the same number of either Sex, who were all present at her Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Whilst she lived, they daily tell down and craved her blessing: They also rose up, and (with the Children of <hi>Solomons</hi> Virtuous woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 28.) <hi>called her blessed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next to her golden Chain of Graces, mentioned by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7.) wherewith she was eminently Beautified) <hi>and the Ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4.) she accounted (with <hi>Cornelia,</hi> that noble <hi>Roman</hi> Matron) her Children to be her chiefest Ornaments; and therefore her desire, and earnest endeavours were to beautifie and adorn them with all virtuous Habits, and to make them the true Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. She knew, and would have them know too, that if they would be happy, to their <hi>Great Birth</hi> there must be added the <hi>New Birth:</hi> To great Kindred and Allies, there must be Relation to the Family of Heaven: To a great Estate, the State of Grace, or else it would come to pass that they would one day wish, that they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been born. She often inculcated into them, <hi>That true Grace is true Greatness▪</hi>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:62667:197"/> And that the more any of them feared and served God, the greater portion of Love they might expect from her.</p>
                  <p>The last Link in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chain is <hi>Charity.</hi> And this <hi>Elect Lady</hi> (2 <hi>John</hi> 1.) <note place="margin">Her Charity.</note> was much in those gracious practices, whereby she might <hi>make her Calling and Election sure.</hi> Much she was in the duties of Piety: Much in the duties of Charity: Many Coats and Garments did this <hi>Dorcas</hi> make whilst she was alive: She had not a hard heart, nor a withered Hand. She was none of those, who <hi>having this worlds goods, and seeing their Brother have need, do yet shut up their bowels of Compassion from him.</hi> She may be a Pattern to all that come after: God gave her the blessing of a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: Yea, he gave her a greater blessing than that, an heart to make a right use of it.</p>
                  <p>Every day <hi>she stretched out her hand to the poor; yea, she reached out her hands to the needy.</hi> A great number she relieved at her Gates, and gave her charge to her Porter, that when there came any that were very Aged, or that complained of great losses in those dismal Times of our Civil Wars, especially if they seemed honest, that he should come and certifie her of it, that she might enlarge her Charity to such; which if he had neglected at any time to do, and she had known of it, probably she would have been as much displeased with him, as once she was with another of her Servants, for neglecting a Command which she had given him in reference to the refreshment of some poor.</p>
                  <p>In those Times of scarcity, every Week she sent many Loaves of Bread to many Neighbour Towns: She caused her Corn to be sold in the Markets (as it were) by Retail, in such small quantities as might not exceed the Poors abilities to purchase. She allowed certain Meals in her House to sundry poor Neighbours, whose empty Bellies were discernible in their pale Faces; and when hereby they had recovered their former Complexion, and received (as it were) a new Life by her means, she with Joy professed, that the sight of such an alteration in them, did her as much good, as any thing which she her self had eaten.</p>
                  <p>She continually imployed many poor old men and women in such works as were fit <note place="margin">Her Prudence.</note> and sutable to their skill and strength.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Physitian</hi> came at any time to her house, she used to make inquiry whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any were sick in the Town; That if any were, they might partake of the same benefit with her self: But at all times when any wanted health, she presently had intelligence of it, and most chearfully Communicated whatsoever she conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conducible to their recovery; having, not only great store of <hi>Cordials</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storatives</hi> always by her, but great Skill and Judgment in the Application of them.</p>
                  <p>And as our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> said unto the <hi>Woman of Canaan (Matth.</hi> 15. 28.) <hi>great is thy Faith,</hi> so may we say of this Virtuous, and Religious Lady, Great was her Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For she knew right well, and considered;</p>
                  <p>That Faith is but a fancy without the <hi>Labour of Love.</hi> For true Faith cannot be idle, its never out of work, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 3. And it <hi>worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>That the greater any are, the better they should be: The more Goods they have, the more Good they shoud do: <hi>And as they have opportunity they should do good to all,</hi> Gal. 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>That such as are rich in this world, have a great charge. For they are charged, <hi>not to be high minded,</hi> and close handed (which they are too apt to be) <hi>But to do good, to be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to Communicate; So laying up in store for themselves, a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6 17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>the Wisdom that is from above,</hi> as 'tis <hi>pure, and peaceable, gentle and easie to be intreated:</hi> So 'tis <hi>full of mercy, and good fruits; without partiality, and without Hypocrisie,</hi> Gal. 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>pure religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: To visit the Fatherless and Widdows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world,</hi> Jam. 1. 27.</p>
                  <p>Thus unspotted she ever kept her self. As the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that justifieth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. So may we say, who can lay any thing to the charge of this Elect Lady? God had sanctified her: Yet not so as to free her from the <hi>Inherency</hi> of sin (for so he sanctifies none in this Life), but
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62667:197"/> so, as to free her from the <hi>Regency</hi> of it, and from all such acts as would have proved a spot, and blemish to her, which all that knew her must needs acknowledge. And this also, that she, like unto a choice and dainty Garden, was free not only from emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Weeds, but richly furnished with all manner of fragrant Flowers and delicate Fruits. Or like the glorious Sun, not only free from <hi>spots,</hi> but full of <hi>Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the Countrey knew her; as <hi>Boaz</hi> said of <hi>Ruth,</hi> all the City knew her to be a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman.</p>
                  <p>At her entrance into her last sickness (which was about a fortnights length) she <note place="margin">Her last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> conceived her Life to be but of a very short continuance, and therefore prepared and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed her self for her dissolution. Yet durst she not but make use of her <hi>Physitians,</hi> whose singular ability and fidelity she had frequently experienced, having been rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Death prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</note> up by them, when she was faln almost as low as the very Grave. And now, had she been recoverable, they (by Gods blessing) would have recovered her. But as he faith;</p>

                     <l>Non est in Medico semper relevetur ut aeger:</l>

                  <p>The most able and learned <hi>Physitians</hi> cannot keep Life when God calls for it. There is no <hi>Antidote</hi> against death: No <hi>doses</hi> will free us from paying our last debt. Go we must when our <hi>Life-Lord</hi> bids us come. The last words of this virtuous Lady were; <hi>My God I come flying unto thee.</hi> Presently after which, her Soul took its flight from <note place="margin">Her Death.</note> hence, and she quietly slept in the Lord in <hi>August, Anno Christi</hi> 1648.</p>
                  <p>Such was her humility and modesty, that although in that Magnificent Monument <note place="margin">Her Humility.</note> which she made for her Husband, Sir <hi>Thomas Lucy</hi> of <hi>Charlcot</hi> in <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> she caused her self to be laid by him in her full proportion; yet would she not suffer her <hi>Epitaph</hi> to bear any proportion with his: She conceived the most that could be said of him was too little, and the least that could be said of her self was too much. Unwilling she was to have any thing at all said of her self: But when that might not be, she would by no means allow of any more than this; Her observance of her dearest Husband while she enjoyed him; her remembrance of him by that Monument, when she had lost him. Only one thing more was added, but full sore against her will; Namely, that her other exquisite Virtues were forbidden by her excessive modesty, to make their appearance in that Marble.</p>

                     <byline>F. H. Van. Houe. Sculp:</byline>

                  </figure>
                  <hi>The Life and Death of the Right Honourable, the Lady</hi> Mary Vere, <hi>who Died, Anno Domini</hi> 1671.</head>
               <p>THis Noble Lady was born of high and Ancient Families on both sides. For <note place="margin">Her Parentage.</note> by her Mothers side she springed from the best Family of the <hi>Throgmortons,</hi> and by the Fathers side, she was extracted from the Ancient family of the <hi>Tracies,</hi> at <hi>Todington</hi> in <hi>Glocestershire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was the youngest of fiften Children, and was born <hi>May</hi> the eighteenth, <hi>Anno</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her Birth.</note>
                  <hi>Christi</hi> 1581. being the three and twentieth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Her Mother died three days after she was born: And her Father when she was but eight years old.</p>
               <p>Thus she was soon left an <hi>Orphan:</hi> But indeed, they only are <hi>Orphans,</hi> who have not <note place="margin">Her Motto.</note> an heavenly Father. So <hi>when her Father, and Mother thus forsook her, the Lord took her up.</hi> And the experiences which she had all her life-long, of Gods most tender care over her, ministred occasion to her to chuse this for her <hi>Motto</hi> (which was found written by her in the Front of most of her Books in her Closet) <hi>God will provide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She took much delight in speaking of one of her Ancestors, as one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <note place="margin">Her Marriages.</note> honours, to her Family, <hi>[William Tracy</hi> of <hi>Toddington,</hi> Esquire] mentioned by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Martyrology</hi> [See the Story of it in my <hi>English Martyrology.</hi> p. 395.] who in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, for the sound profession of his Faith, set down by him in his Last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament,</hi> was, two years after his Decease, condemned to have his body taken up, and burnt, which Sentence was Executed accordingly.</p>
               <p>This virtuous Lady was twice married: First, to Mr. <hi>William Hobby,</hi> her first Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, when she was nineteen years old, and by him she had two Sons, who were by her relgiously educated, and the happy, and comfortable fruit of this her care she reaped at their pious deaths (they going both of them, young to heaven, having lived long
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62667:198"/> in a short time) the younger died in the fourteeath year of his Age, and the Elder in his three and twentieth, who in his Life was much admired for his parts, and as much beloved for his piety.</p>
               <p>Her second Husband was Sir <hi>Horace Vere,</hi> afterwards Baron of <hi>Tilbury,</hi> a Person not to be named without some Honorable Character, a Man whose <hi>Coat Armour</hi> made more Renowned than his <hi>Coat of Arms,</hi> and whose Personal Atchievements in the field (especially at the battel at <hi>New-port)</hi> ennobled more, than the high blood derived from his Ancestors. But his unstained piety gave him the highest <hi>Character</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Veres</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> of all. By the other indeed, he purchased a <hi>Great Name,</hi> like unto the <hi>Great Men</hi> that are in the Earth [2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 19.] But by this, he procured a <hi>Good Name.</hi> And even <hi>Tacitus</hi> himself, (the <hi>Roman</hi> Historian) prefers the praise gotten by <hi>Goodness,</hi> before that which is obtained by <hi>Greatness.</hi> And therefore speaking of a noble <hi>Roman,</hi> he saith, that he was, <hi>inter claros potius, quam inter bonos censendus:</hi> Rather to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongst the <hi>Famous,</hi> than among the <hi>good</hi> men.</p>
               <p>This noble Lord was one, that could as well wrestle with God, as fight with men, and may be thought to have gotten his Victories upon his knees in his <hi>Closet,</hi> before he drew his Sword in the <hi>Field.</hi> And when he had overcome his Enemies, he could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come himself also, being one of the humblest souls, in whom so much true worth lodged, that we have heard of.</p>
               <p>His good Lady used to say, that she honoured him for his valour, but most, for the grace of God which shined in him. And hence it was, that she did <hi>Coruscare radiis Mariti,</hi> shine by the Rays of her Husbands excellencies: But yet not only with these; for she had rare, and radiant beams of her own, by which she cast the like honour upon him. So happily was this noble couple suited, as in the high extraction of both their Births, so also in the rest of their accomplishments, that they mutually illustrated each the others honour.</p>
               <p>But passing by all her <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Secular Prerogatives,</hi> we will now present her in some of her <hi>spiritual excellencies.</hi> These indeed are those that give an intrinsick value to a person. For he that would take the true height of a man, must not measure him with the advantage ground he stands upon. We may say of this gracious Lady, what <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> said of a noble person in his time: <hi>She was a faithful woman, and feared God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her Piety.</note>
                  <hi>many, [Nehemiah</hi> 7. 2.] Some there are so prodigiously wicked, and profligate, that they seem to have wedded the Vices of many others: But this good, and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lady may be said to have collected, and espoused the excellencies of many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For in her might be seen these various Graces, which grow to an eminency, but severally in others, met in her altogether in one <hi>knot</hi> or <hi>Nosegay.</hi> To instance in some few of them.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>The Fear of the Great God was very great in her:</hi> Wonderful tender she was of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending <note place="margin">1. Her fear of God.</note> him by any known sin. She hath often been heard to say, and that very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly. <hi>Oh! I would not sin against my God.</hi> She professed that she dreaded Hell most, as a place wherein God was <hi>blasphemed.</hi> O precious Saint! To dread Hells Sin, more than Hells Fire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Her <hi>Zeal to the worship of God,</hi> was very eminent. First to the Publick: <note place="margin">2. Her Zeal.</note> This was evidenced many ways.</p>
               <p>First. By her great care and Zeal to get able, and faithful Ministers for those Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings whereof she had the disposal, and by her improving her utmost interest to procure the like for the Parish wherein she lived, in its several vacancies. And herein the noble Patron, did most kindly gratifie her by giving her the nomination, thereby deeply ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, not only her Honour, but the whole Parish also: So that they which lived in that place, enjoyed a <hi>Goshen of Gospel Light</hi> for a long season together, and are able also to tell, how comfortably she spake to them who preached the good Word of God among them, which countenance, and real encouragement she gave them in carrying on the Lords work, without sparing her Purse to do it.</p>
               <p>Secondly. By her constant attendance on the publick worship, so long as the Lord vouchsafed her health to do it: yea, she did not only attend on it her self, but took care that her Family should do the like also: And they that would not serve God with her, were no Servants for her.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>She was not less devout, than constant at the publick worship.</hi> She durst not <note place="margin">Her holy walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> trifle with holy things, nor in holy duties, which gave occasion to one to say of her: <hi>That the Lady</hi> Vere <hi>by her solemn, and reverend deportment in Divine Worship, would make</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:62667:199"/>
                  <hi>one believe that there is a God indeed.</hi> And as for the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which is so wofully neglected by too many, her desires were eager, and ardent to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it frequently: Saying, <hi>that she durst not neglect, no not any one opportunity that was offered for the enjoying of this Sacred Ordinance.</hi> And Oh! How serious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was she in her preparation for it? The whole preceding week, was taken up by her for that work; in which week also she would always have a private Fast kept for her Family, or a secret one in her Closet. Hereby she declared, that she meant to storm Heaven, and <hi>to take it by violence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>For her private Worship of God,</hi> let us follow her from the Church to her <note place="margin">Private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> own House, and we shall find that she brought her Religion and Devotion home with her, and did not leave them in her Pue behind her, till she returned thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the next <hi>Lords Day,</hi> as too many do. For some there are that can Complement Almighty God, before their Neighbours on the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> but care not to acquaint themselves with God at home all the week after. But if ever any private dwelling, might be called a <hi>Chappel,</hi> or <hi>little Sanctuary,</hi> Hers much more. There you might find her, and her Family twice every day upon their knees, solemnly worshiping the Great God: There you might see them humbly sitting, at his feet, to hear Gods most Holy word read unto them: Concluding constantly their Evening Service with one of <hi>Davids Psalms;</hi> what strangers soever were there present, there was no putting by, or adjorning the Service of God to a more convenient time.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Lords day,</hi> you might hear the Sermons Preached in publick, repeated to <note place="margin">Sabbaths Sanctified.</note> the Family: The Servants called to give an account before her, of what each of them remembred: And the high praises of God sounded forth by the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily joyntly, and together. Also after Supper, you might hear the Servants in their Room, exercising themselves in the like Heavenly duty of singing <hi>Psalms:</hi> And no sooner did this good Lady hear them begin their <hi>Melody,</hi> but away she would go to joyn with them in that duty.</p>
               <p>If you followed her up the Stairs, there you should be sure to find her, twice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, shut up for some hours, in her Closet, (which was excellently furnished with pious books of Practical Divinity.) Here she redeemed much precious time, in reading the sacred Scriptures, and other good books, that might give her further light into them, and edifiy her in her most holy Faith. Here she poured out her devout Soul, with such fervour of Spirit in Prayer, as could not be hid (at least sometimes) from those of her attendants, and Maidens, whose occasions, drew them at any time, near unto her Closet door. And yet are we not at an end of this choise, and pious Ladies Devotions. For every night she used her self to pray with her Maidens before she went to Bed. And now, is it any wonder, that she grew so rich in Grace, who drove so great, and constant a Trade in the use of the means of Grace, and that had so many ways to bring her in Spiritual gains?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Her Love to God,</hi> (beside what hath been already sayd) did many ways <note place="margin">Love to God.</note> make it self evident to be in a high degree in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r.</p>
               <p>First, By her mournful complaint which she frequently made, because she could Love God no better. The reason indeed of which was, because she loved him so much: Therefore she thought she loved him so little, because she knew that she could r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver love him enough. The truth is, she had such raised apprehensions of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Excellency, as caused her to think her highest affections unworthy of him. For none indeed that have such high apprehensions of the Divine greatness, and goodness, can love him little, or think their Love, when highest, to be great.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By her vehement desires and longings that she had to be gone hence, that she might be with <hi>Christ,</hi> which she accounted <hi>best of all.</hi> She was one of those very few Christians, which stood in need of old Mr. <hi>John Dods</hi> Use of Exhortation, which he would make to the Saints in his Preaching; That they would be content, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, tho they were not taken up to Heaven so soon as they desired. This Good Man (who was one of the most Heavenly Souls that this Age brought forth) having lived to a great Age, and finding that to do this was something difficult in himself, thought that it was ordinary with others to do the like: Whereas (God knows) that most Christians, are of a lower form in <hi>Christs</hi> School: Prone rather to linger too much here, than to be too hasty of going hence; So that they rather need a Spur than a Bridle, and Ministers have more reason to take hold of them, with the strongest Arguments they can invent, and find out, to draw them from the Love of Life, and the world
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62667:199"/> (As the Angels drew <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom)</hi> than to perswade them to be willing to continue here.</p>
               <p>But this gracious Lady knew, and enjoyed so much of Heaven, as made her stay here <note place="margin">Death desired</note> below, tedious unto her. The earnest option of her Soul was, <hi>Come Lord Jesus; Come quickly.</hi> For she found to her great grief, that her imperfect State on Earth, made it impossible for her, to serve God here as she would, and heartily desired; and therefore did oft wonderfully complain, that she was unprofitable, and unserviceable; and her deep sense of her unserviceableness (even whilst others admired her fruitfulness, and usefulness) did still encrease her desires to be, where all these infirmities and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections would be perfectly cured, and where she knew her abilities should perfectly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond with the largest of her desires which she had to serve and glorifie God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. By her love to the Saints, who were born of God, and had his lively I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage <note place="margin">Love to the Saints.</note> stamped upon them. And this in Scripture is made one of the fairest evidences of our Love to God. For <hi>every one that loveth the Father that begat, loveth him that is begotten,</hi> [1 Joh. 5. 1.] A man may love the Child, and yet not love his Father: But he cannot love him because he is his Child, and because he is like his Father, but he must needs love his Father. Yea, love him first and most, because his love to the Child springs from his love to the Father.</p>
               <p>This good, and gracious Lady then, was doubtless a great Lover of God himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she had so dear an affection for his Children.</p>
               <p>She did not praise the dead Saints, and Persecute the living. She did not pretend love to those that lived far from her; but shewed kindness to those that lived near her. She did not factiously love some of one Party, and reproach those of another. In a word, she did not love the Saints in an equality with others, from a natural tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which disposes some to be kind unto all, good and bad: But her love was a Cordial, spiritual, special, and uniform Love to them; where ever she saw any thing of God, her Love was drawn out towards them, and she had the most Love for those, that discovered most of God in them. She loved them so as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Converse, and Communion with them; yea, and the chiefest of her Charity was extended to them.</p>
               <p>As for the faithful Ministers of <hi>Christ,</hi> whose Office and Function lifts them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <note place="margin">Love to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> private Christians, few ever exceeded her, in loving and honouring of them: yea, she loved first the Ministry, and then the Ministers; professing seriously, the great love, and high esteem she had for them, was for their dear Masters sake, whose <hi>Ambassadors</hi> they were: So that what was said, concerning her worthy Son-in-Law, in <hi>Norfolk</hi> [Sir <hi>Roger Towsend],</hi> that for his love to the Ministry, he obtained the Title of being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Deliciae Cleri,</hi> The Ministers delight; May be truly given unto her.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. By her <hi>works of Charity,</hi> which were remarkable upon many accounts.</p>
               <p>First, By the largness of her Charity: so great indeed it was, that it may well be <note place="margin">Her Charity.</note> admired, how this Tree should not long ago have killed it self with overbearing. The Trees in our Orchards yield us Fruit but once a year: And take so long a time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover heart before they can bear again: But her Charity was as Fruit dropping all the year long. Many ways it diffused it self. She had mony for the empty Purse, meat for the empty Belly: Medicaments for the Sick: Salves for the Wounded, or that had Sores. Abundance of good she did this way in Town and Country. She was not only liberal, <hi>but devised liberal things.</hi> If her Servants knew of any that were in great need, and did not acquaint her with it; when afterwards, by other ways she came to hear of it, she would be very angry with them for it. It fell out that an honest poor Neighbour died, before she knew of his sickness; for which being troubled, she asked her Servant that attended her, whether he had wanted in his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Adding, <hi>I tell you I had rather part with my Gown from my back than that the poor should want.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. In the <hi>Prime objects of her Charity:</hi> She did indeed cast her Seed upon all sorts of Ground, but especially upon Gods enclosure. The <hi>Houshold of Faithful</hi> had her fullest Handf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls. To such she never thought that she gave enough.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. She was <hi>wonderful secret in what she gave.</hi> For when she could do it, she did not give her Charity as some throw there mony into a Basin at a Collection, so as that it might Ring again: but it fell like Oil into a Vessel, without any noise.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. We may take notice of her <hi>self-denying spirit</hi> in all this. She (good Lady) was no Merit-monger. She never thought to purchase Land in Heaven, with

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:62667:239"/> the money which she gave on Earth. She was no Merchant to sell her Charity, but a faithful <hi>Steward,</hi> acknowledging that what she gave, was not her own, but her Lords Money. She was notwithstanding all her Charity, carried out to a naked <hi>Christ,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to be sound alone in him, and his righteousness, as earnestly as if she had not done any one good work in all her Life.</p>
               <p>Fifthly. <hi>By her Sincerity.</hi> This indeed was as her under Garment, which she wore <note place="margin">Her Sincerity.</note> nearest to her, and which gave an excellency to all her other Graces. And truly, many notable Testimonies there were to demonstrate the singleness and soundness of her heart.</p>
               <p>As First, <hi>The uniformity of her holy walking:</hi> Her Religion was not like the drift snow, which lies thick in one place, and leaves the ground bare in another. The hypocrite hath always some naked plot in his Conversation, that gives others some just cause to suspect him. You may (with <hi>Herod)</hi> perswade him <hi>to do many things:</hi> But can never, make him (with S. <hi>Paul) willing in all things to live honestly.</hi> But this Pious Ladies Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, one part did admirably correspond, and agree with another. An happy <hi>Symetry</hi> appeared in her whole course, both towards God and man, both abroad, and at home; among her Domestick Relations, those that lived constantly with her, who saw her (as we usually say) hot, and cold; In her Night-cloths, as when dressed to go abroad. Surely few have had an higher Testimony for Piety, from those that have lived near, and long with them, than she hath from all that lived under her Roof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The great freedom</hi> which she gave to her Friends in speaking to her of what they saw amiss in her. She used much to applaud that priviledge, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of having a faithful Friend; saying, that <hi>others might see more by us than we could by our selves:</hi> She also used to say, <hi>That it was a great mercy to be convinced of any sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Her Faith,</hi> which used then to be strongest when death seemed to be <note place="margin">Her Faith.</note> nearest. Like that great Soldier we read of, who would tremble every joint of him, whilst his Armour was puting on in his Tent, but was dauntless when he came to fight in the Field. And to a Captain in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who using to wear his Sword, if any, though but a Child handled it, he would fall a trembling, yet in a Battel, he would fight like a Lion. Somewhat more than a twelve month before her death, she fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a long swound, which continued about half an hour, without any sensible hopes of recovery: But as soon as she came again to her self; she said, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> &amp;c. And being conveyed to her Chamber, there again she said: <hi>I know whom I have trusted:</hi> whereas an Hypocrites hope is compared <hi>to the giving up of the Ghost, [Job</hi> 11. 20.] And in this particular, is not unlike it. For as in a dying man his breath grows shorter and shorter, till at last its quite puffed out; so commonly the Hypocrites hope lesseneth, as death groweth nearer, and usually expireth before the man himself dies. <hi>Impius dum spirat sperat: Justus cum expirat sperat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly. <hi>Her Humility</hi> was rare, and signal. This we may call her upper Garment, with which she strove to cover her other excellencies, though their beauty was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">Her Humility.</note> the more conspicuous and amiable, by casting this Veil over them. Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is like a precious ointment, which the closer its held in a mans hand, the more strongly it sends forth its sweet Savour. O! How meanly did she think of her self? She saw not how brightly her own Face did shine, whilst others beheld, and admired it. Her frequent complaint was, <hi>that she was useless, and unprofitable, and that she did no good.</hi> She did never speak of her perfections; but frequently of her imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, wants, weakness, and unworthiness. Yea, she would often say, I <hi>abhor my self: Indeed I do.</hi> How easie of access, even for the meanest to come into her presence? How affable, courteous, and lowly was her deportment to the poorest? many times when her very Servants had done a business well, which she had set them about, she would thank them for it. <hi>The Law of kindness was in her Tongue</hi> to whomsoever she spake.</p>
               <p>But we are now come to her gracious behaviour in her last sickness, wherein her <note place="margin">Her last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> pains were very strong, but her patience were stronger. Never was she heard to mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to utter any one repining word: But still she justified God in all his Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations towards her, and dealings with her. Yea, more, she was much in admiring, and blessing God for his mercies, in her accutest pains, and greatest Agonies. How doth this blessed Soul now Carol forth the Praises of God in Heaven? who could
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62667:239"/> Sing them so sweetly whilst these sharp Thorns were at her breast? Or that could keep her heart in tune for this high Note, in her greatest bodily pains and dolors?</p>
               <p>She was not wholly fee from assaults of Satan. It would indeed have been strange if he had not considered this pretious Servant of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and offered her some disturbance at this time, whom he had found so great, and old an Enemy to him, and his Kingdom of darkness. But he came only to be beaten back with shame, and to add more <hi>Trophies</hi> to all her former Victories over him. The last Words which were observed to be spoken by her, before that fatal <hi>Lethargy,</hi> seized upon <note place="margin">Her last words and Death.</note> her poor, weak, and out worn body (which in two days carried her off the Stage of this world unto a better) were: <hi>How shall I do to be thankful? How shall I do to praise my God?</hi> Thus she ended her life here in the exercise of that duty, which was to be her constant, and endless work in that Life, which she was then entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. She thus blessedly dyed <hi>December 25th. Anno Christi.</hi> 1671. In the nintieth year of her age.</p>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Mrs.</hi> Katherine Clark <hi>who Died, Anno Domini</hi> 1675.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>KAtherine Overton</hi> (for so was her Virgin Name) was born at <hi>Bedworth</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Her Parentage and Birth.</note> of <hi>Warwick,</hi> four miles from <hi>Coventry, February</hi> the Twenty fifth, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1602. of Godly, and Religious Parents. Her Father was Mr. <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Overton,</hi> Rector of <hi>Bedworth,</hi> where he lived a constant, and painful Preacher of Gods Holy Word, till he was almost Eighty two years old. Her Mother was Mrs. <hi>Isa. Overton,</hi> a gracious Woman, and an excellent Huswife, who took off the whole burden of Family affairs, both within, and without Doors from her Husband, that he might with the more freedom attend his Holy Calling.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Katherine</hi> was, by these her Parents brought up Religiously, and it pleased God <note place="margin">Her Education.</note> betimes to plant the Seeds of Grace in her Heart, which first discovered themselves, when she was about fifteen years Old: At which time God was pleased to discover un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Early working of Grace.</note> her the corruption of her nature, and some common miscarriages which are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto youth: And these made such a deep impression upon her tenders years, that whereas she was naturally of a chearful <hi>Sanguine</hi> Constitution, she now became serious, and somewhat <hi>Melancholy.</hi> Hereupon Satan, that Old Serpent, and Enemy to our <note place="margin">Her Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</note> Souls, assaulted her with many, and various Temptations, whereby he sought to quench these Heavenly Sparks, to stifle this New Creature in its first Conception. But by frequent reading the sacred Scriptures, diligent attending to the Word Preached, and secret Prayer, it pleased the All-wise God to support, and strengthen her against him, and all his Devices. Yet did these conflicts continue the longer, because she had none to whom she durst unbosom her self, and make her Case known.</p>
               <p>When she was about seventeen years old, she was by her Parents sent to <hi>Siwel</hi> in <note place="margin">More Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note>
                  <hi>Northampton-shire</hi> to wait upon a young Lady, that was somewhat Related to her.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:62667:202"/>
               <p> Yet this kind of life was so tedious and irksome to her, that at the end of Six <note place="margin">Her return home.</note> Months she prevailed with her Parents to send for her home again. Hear the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of it in her own Words as they were found Written in her Cabinet after her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease. <q>When (saith she) I was but young, my Father being at Prayers in his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Her own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her Conversion.</note> I many times found such sweetness, and was so affected therewith, that I could not but wish that my Heart might oftner be in such a frame. But Childhood, and the Vanities thereof soon cooled these Heavenly Sparks. But my Father caused me to write Sermons, and to repeat the same; As also to learn Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his <hi>Catechism,</hi> which I oft repeated to my self when I was alone; And therein especially I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of those places wherein he had set down the Signs and Marks of a strong, and weak Faith, being convinced in my Conscience that without Faith I could not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; And that every Faith would not serve turn to bring me to Heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Hereupon I fell to Examination of my self, and though I could not find the Marks of a Strong, (through Gods Mercy) I found the marks of a true, though but weak Faith, which was some Comfort, and support to me. And that God which began this good work in me, was pleased to quicken and stir me up to a diligent use of such means as himself had ordained and appointed for the encrease thereof: As hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word Preached, Receiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and use of other private Duties.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But when I was about seventeen years old my Parents sent me to wait upon a young Gentlewoman in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> the only Daughter of Sir <hi>W. W.</hi> At which time being sent so far from my near and dear Relations, and meeting with some other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements in the Family, through want of the means of Grace, which I formerly enjoyed, I grew very <hi>Melancholy.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I began also to have great workings of Conscience in me, and Satan (that deadly Enemy to the health, and welfare of our Souls, who like a Roaring Lion walks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout continually seeking whom he may devour) took his advantage (through my Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of his devices) to raise up fears, doubts, and terrors of Conscience in me, by reason of my manifold Sins, and for walking so unworthy Gods Mercies whilst I did enjoy them, and for being so unfruitful under the means of Grace, and so unable to obey God, and to keep his Commandments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And by reason hereof I had no Peace, nor rest in my Soul, Night nor Day, but was perswaded that all the threatnings contained in the Book of God against Wicked and Ungodly men, did belong unto me, and were my Portion, as being one of them against whom they were denounced; Insomuch as when I took up the Bible to read therein, it was accompanied with much fear and trembling; Yet being convinced that it was my Duty frequently to read Gods Word, I durst not omit, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus I continued a great while, bearing the burden of grievous Temptations, and</q> inward Afflictions of Conscience, yet durst I not open the wound, nor reveal my <q>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to any, as thinking and judging my condition and case to be like no Bodies else: But God who is rich and infinite in Mercy, and Jesus Christ, who bought his Elect at so dear a rate, would not suffer any of his to be lost, and therefore he was graciously pleased to preserve, strengthen, and uphold me by his own power from sinking into Hell through Despair, and from running out of my Wits.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus by reason of my continual grief and anguish of Heart Night and Day, I was so weakned and changed within the compass of these six Months, that when I came home my Dear Parents they scarce knew me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Some years after her return, she (for the most part) continued in her Fathers Family, <note place="margin">Her growth in Grace.</note> where by a diligent and conscientious use of the means, both publick and private, she did thrive and grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, as she increased and grew in Days and Years; and therewith also learned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised all parts of Huswifry, which might fit her for the Government of a Family, when God should call her thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>February</hi> 2, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1625. Which was the same Day on which King <hi>Charles</hi> the <note place="margin">Her Marriage.</note> first was Crowned, she was, with the consent of Parents on both sides, married to Mr <hi>Sa. Clark,</hi> who at that time was Minister at <hi>Shotwick,</hi> four miles beyond <hi>West-Chester,</hi> who looked upon this Match as the greatest outward temporal Blessing that ever God bestowed upon him; whereby he could experimentally say, That a <hi>Prudent Wife is the Gift of God:</hi> And that in the enjoyment of her, he enjoyed more Mercies than he could
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62667:203"/> well enumerate. But to descend to particulars, and to take notice of some of those Virtues and Graces wherewith God had beautified, and adorned her Soul.</p>
               <p>First her Piety was signal and exemplary from her first Conversion to the Hour of <note place="margin">Her Piety.</note> her Death: Her life was not stained with any scandalous Sin, which might be a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, either to her Person, Profession, or Relations. She was a constant, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent attender upon the publick Ministry of Gods Holy Word; And when she lived where she had the opportunity of hearing Lectures in the week day, she made choice to attend upon those who were most plain, practical, and powerful Preachers, from whose Sermons, and Gods blessing upon them, she always sucked some spiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment and came home refreshed from them. And when days of Humiliation, or Thanksgiving came, she never failed to make one among Gods People in the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of them.</p>
               <p>The Lords Days she carefully Sanctified, both in publick and in private; rising ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier <note place="margin">Sabbaths Sanctified.</note> upon them than upon other's, especially when she had many young Children about her, that so she might have opportunity, as well for secret, as for Family duties, before she was called away to the publick. She was like unto <hi>Davids</hi> Door-keeper, One of the first in, and last out of Gods House. Her constant Gesture at Prayer was Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, thinking that she could not be too humble before God. Her usual manner was to write Sermons to prevent drowsiness and distractions, and to help Memory, whereof she hath left many Volumes, and her practice was to make good use of them, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reading and Meditating upon them; And if at any time she was cast into such Places, and Company as were a hinderance unto her in the strict Sanctification of this Holy Day, it was a grief and burden to her.</p>
               <p>There was no Day that passed over her head (except Sickness, or some other una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydable <note place="margin">Scriptures read.</note> necessity hindred) wherein she did not read some portions of the Sacred Scriptures, both in the <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> and of the Psalms; and in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing she took special notice of such passages as most concerned her self. She was frequent, and constant in Secret Prayer, and Meditation. She also read much in other good Books, especially, in the works of those Eminent, and excellent Divines, Mr. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Reyner:</hi> And in reading of them she used to transcribe such passages as most warmed her heart.</p>
               <p>She never neglected any opportunity of receiving the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sacrament preparation.</note> and before her coming to it, was very strict, and serious in the Duty of <hi>Self-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,</hi> and for her furtherance therein, at those times she read some of those Books that treated upon that subject. And the Fruits of her holiness manifested themselves in the exercise of those Graces which God required of her. She was not a Wordy, but a Real Christian: A true <hi>Israelite,</hi> in whom was no guile. Her endeavour was to yield universal, constant, cheerful, and sincere Obedience to all Gods Commandments, and wherein she failed, and came short, it was her grief, and Burden. Her Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon what she heard and read were frequent: And her heart having <hi>indited a good matter, her tongue was as the Pen of a ready Writer,</hi> taking opportunities to speak to the Edification of those with whom she conversed.</p>
               <p>She filled every Relation with the Exercise of such Graces, and Duties as were suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto, knowing that where Relative duties are neglected, and not made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of, there also our pretended Religion is in Vain.</p>
               <p>First, As a Wife: She was singular, and very Exemplary in that reverence and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience <note place="margin">A good Wife.</note> which she yeilded to her Husband, both in Words, and Deeds. She never rose from the Table, even when they were alone, but she made courtesie. She never drank to him without bowing. His word was a Law unto her: She often deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her self to gratifie him: And when in her sickness, and weakness he mentioned her Case in particular unto God in his Prayers, the Duty being ended, she would make him courtesie, and thank him. In case of his absence she would pray with her Family Morning, and Evening: The like she would do in his presence, in case of his Sickness, and inability to perform the Duty himself. Her Modesty, and Chastity were rare, and remarkable: But fitter to be conceived by those which know what belongs to them, than to be expressed in words. For there is a conjugal, as well as a Virginal, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Chastity.</p>
               <p>In Case of her Husbands Sickness, she was a tender, diligent, and painful Nurse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him; Skilful, and careful in making him Broths, and what else was needful for him. If at any time she saw him in passion, with sweet and gentle words she would
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62667:203"/> mollifie and moderate it. She was often a Spur, but never a Bridle to him in those things which were good.</p>
               <p>She was always well pleased with such Habitations, as (in their many removes) he provided for her; And with such Apparel, and Diet as his means (which was sometimes short) would allow. She never grutched, nor grumbled at any of those Dispensations which Gods All-wise Providence carved out unto them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As a Mother to her Children (whereof God gave her nine, four Sons, <note place="margin">As a Mother.</note> and five Daughters) she nourished them all with her own breasts; was very handy and handsome about them in their minority; Kept them sweet and cleanly; In neat and modest Habits; Knew how to order them both in Health and Sickness. She loved them dearly without fondness; Was careful to give them Nurture as well as Nourishment, not sparing the Rod when there was just occasion. And as soon as they were capable, she was vigilant and diligent to season their tender years with Grace and Vertue, by instilling into them the first grounds, and Principles of Religion; And as they grew up, she did more freely discover her tender Affections to them, by Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, advice, and good Counsel as there was occasion; And when they were disposed of abroad, by her gracious letters, and hearty Instructions at their meetings, she la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to build them up in grace and godliness: And God was pleased to let her see (to her great Joy and Comfort) the fruit of her Prayers, and pains in keeping them from scandalous Courses in these corrupt times, and in working Grace in most of their Hearts. When they were married, and had Children, she was frequently making one thing or other for them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As a Mistress to her Maids: She was careful (so far as she could) to bring <note place="margin">As a Mistress.</note> such as were Religious, at least, seemingly, into her Family; And having occasion to be much in their Company, she would take all occasions, and opportunities to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest her love and care of their Souls, by frequent dropping in good Counsel and wholesome Instructions; By Chatechising; Enquiring what they remembred of the Sermons they heard; Reading her Notes to them; Encouraging them in what was good, and with the Spirit of meekness blaming them for what was evil. And for Huswifery, and Houshold Affairs, she instructed their Ignorance, commended and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged what they did well, and her self (being of an active, and stirring dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having her hand in most businesses) set them a Pattern, and gave them an Example how to order the same. She was careful (so far as possibly she could) to prevent all spoil, and to see that they did not eat the Bread of Idleness.</p>
               <p>Towards her friends, and her own, and her Husbands Relations she was courteous <note place="margin">As a Friend.</note> and amiable in her deportment, free and hearty in their entertainment. She would have plenty without want, and competency without superfluity; And all so neatly and well ordered, that none which came to her Table (whereof some were Persons of Honor and Quality) but Commended her Cookery, and were well pleased with their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
               <p>In her Houshold Furniture she loved not to want, nor desired more than was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <note place="margin">Her Hous-wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery.</note> It was, though not costly, yet cleanly, and she was frequent in repairing and mending decays, and what was amiss, both in Linnens, and Woollens.</p>
               <p>For her Apparel, she was never willing to have that which was costly for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Her Habit.</note> or gairish for the manner: Rather under than above her Rank. For the Fashion of it, was grave and Exemplary, without Newfangledness and Levity. She follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Peters</hi> directions which he gave to Christian Women in his time [1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3 &amp;c.] <hi>whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting their Hair, and of wearing of Gold, or of putting on of Apparel. But let it be the hidden man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which it in the sight of God of great price. For after this manner in old time, the holy Women who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own Husbands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whatsoever Apparel she had, she was careful to keep it from stains, and rends, and so soon as any thing was amiss, presently to amend it, insomuch as she made it last long, and yet it was always whole and neat. All her own, and Husbands linnens, she made her self, and much of her other Apparel: And at leisure times she imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her self in knitting Stockings for her self and Grand▪Children; and was as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and handy in mending her Husbands Cloaths, as her own.</p>
               <p>She was very Charitable to the Poor where ever she lived, according to that Estate <note place="margin">Her Charity.</note> wherewith God had entrusted her. She was ready to relieve such as were Objcts of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62667:204"/> Charity, with Meat, or Drink, and to lend them Mony, and to minister some <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical</hi> things (whereof her Closet was never empty) according as their necessities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>She had a very melting Heart, and truly Sympathized with the Church and People of God, whether at home or abroad, in all their sufferings, and rejoyced in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity. <note place="margin">Her Sympathy.</note> She was much affected with, and afflicted for that great loss which the Church of Christ had, when so many able, Godly, faithful, and painful Ministers were eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; not thrust forth into, but thrust out from labouring in Gods Harvest; wherein her Husband, and two Sons were co-sufferers, to the loss of their livelihoods; yet the loss of their Liberty lay nearer to her Heart, and was a far greater Grief to her than the outward wants they were exposed to.</p>
               <p>Her Humility was not inferior to her other Graces. She had always a very low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem <note place="margin">Her Humility.</note> of her self, and was ready to prefer others before her self, and would not take it ill when her inferiors were set above her; She well remembred the Apostle <hi>Peters</hi> charge, <hi>All of you be subject one to another, and be cloathed with Humility. For God resisteth the Proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi> And that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 12. 10. <hi>In honour prefer one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her Love to God, to his Ordinances, and to his Children was hearty, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Her Love to God and Man</note> Dissimulation. <hi>She abhorred that which was evil, and clave to that which was good.</hi> She was of sweet and meek a disposition that she never used to speak evil of any, but was ever prone to forgive and forget wrongs.</p>
               <p>She was very prudent in managing her Houshold affairs to the best advantage. She <note place="margin">Her Prudence.</note> would have divers Dishes of Meat with little cost; yet so dressed and ordered as made them geateful and pleasing unto all: When they were alone, she had such variety of Dishes and Dresses as prevented nauseousness. She was careful to see that nothing was lost or spoiled. By her wise and frugal managing her Houshold, though her Husband had never much coming in, yet at the years end he could always save something: So that <hi>her price to him was far above Rubies: His Heart trusted in her.</hi> For she <hi>did him good, and not evil all the Days of her Life, Prov</hi> 31. 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>In her Younger Days she was healthful; Of a cheerful and active Spirit, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring <note place="margin">Her Activity.</note> Idleness; She would have her Hand in every business. In her Old Age, though she was crazie, yet whilst she could stand, she would be about one kind of work or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. She bore her weakness and Afflictions with much Patience and holy submission to the will and good pleasure of God; she was so uniform in the frame of her Spirit, <note place="margin">Her Patience.</note> and so maintained her Peace with God through her Holy and humble walking, that when Death, many times in her sickness, threatned to seize upon her, She feared it not, as knowing that it would be gain and advantage to her: Concerning which hear what she her self left in writing which was found after her Decease.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In my younger Days (saith she) my spiritual Afflictions, and inward troubles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long before I could attain to any assurance of my Salvation: But of late years it hath pleased God of his infinite Mercy, and Free Grace to give me more Assurance of his unchangeable Love to me through Faith in his Rich and free Promises of Life, and Salvation, through <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who is pretious to my Soul, and who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finisher of my Faith; God blessed for evermore: To whom be Praise and Glory World without end <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In her converse with her Friends <hi>She opened her Mouth with Wisdom, and in her</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her aimiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note>
                  <hi>Tongue was the Law of Kindness (Prov.</hi> 31. 26.) which made her Company grateful unto all, and burdensom, or undervalued by none.</p>
               <p>Divers years before her Death, upon catching Cold, she had many fits of sickness, and weakness, and some of them were so violent, as brought her near unto Death; Yet the Lord had mercy upon her Husband and Family in raising her up again almost beyond hopes, and expectation: And she was always a Gainer by her Afflictions, God mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good that Promise to her, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>All things shall work together for good to them</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Afflictions san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</note>
                  <hi>that love God, To them who are Called according to the purpose.</hi> For after those fits she walked more humbly, holily, fruitfully, and faithfully, both in her General, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling, as one that waited daily for the appearing of her Lord, and Master. The Winter before her Death, she enjoyed better Health than she had done for some Winters before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the <hi>25th. Anno Christi,</hi> 1675. Some Friends came from <hi>London</hi> to dine with her, and that morning (according to her usual custom in such Cases) She was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62667:204"/> and busie in providing for their kind entertainment: But it pleased God whilst <note place="margin">Her last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> they were at Dinner to strike her with a kind of Shivering, which made her look pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than ordinary, and after Dinner her Distemper continued, so that she was soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to her Chamber, and not long after, for the most part to her Bed. But herein God shewed her great mercy, and had respect to her weakness, in that, during all the time of her languishing she was free from Sickness, and pain, only sometimes she was troubled with some Stiches, which yet were tolerable, not violent: She was also troubled with some Vapours which made her Breath very short; Yet had she a pretty good Stomach, and she relished her Food well till about two Days before her Death; <note place="margin">Gods Mercy.</note> But then, though she did eat, yet she found little tast in her Meat. Her sleep was pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty good, and always very quiet. She was never ill either after Food or Sleep. Only two Days before her Departure she slept little, by reason of the continual ratling of Flegm in her Throat, when she wanted strength to expectorate it.</p>
               <p>As for the State of her Soul during all the time of her sickness, she enjoyed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Peace and Screnity, and had (through Gods Mercy) much Joy, and Peace, by believing; Satan (that Roaring Lion) who uses to be most strong when we are most weak being so chained up by God, that he had no power to molest her. She often cryed out <hi>Hold out faith and patience;</hi> She told her nearest Relation, when she saw him mourning over her, that she was going to be joyned to a Better Husband.</p>
               <p>Her youngest Son, taking his leave of her the Day before her Death, she gave him much Heavenly Counsel for the good of his Soul, and Blessed him, and all his, as she did the rest of her Children and Grand-Children. She earnestly desired to be Dissolved, and breathed after a fuller enjoyment of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> which she accounted <hi>best of all:</hi> She would sometimes say, <hi>that it was a hard thing to die:</hi> And <hi>this is a hard work.</hi> Her Understanding, Memory, and Speech continued till within two Minutes of Death; <note place="margin">Death.</note> And a little before, her Daughter speaking to her of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> She replyed, <hi>My God and my Lord:</hi> And so <hi>June</hi> the 21, about five a Clock in the morning, She fell asleep, exchanging this Life for a Better, without any alteration in her Countenance, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that her colour was gone. She closed up her Eyes her self, as who should say, <hi>It is but winking, and I shall be in Heaven.</hi> She <hi>changed her place, but not her Company.</hi> She sickned <hi>May</hi> the <hi>25th. Anno Christi,</hi> 1675. She concluded her Days <hi>June</hi> the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty First, being <hi>Munday,</hi> about five a Clock in the Morning; when having ended her last <hi>Sabbath</hi> upon Earth, she began to Celebrate an Everlasting <hi>Sabbath</hi> in Heaven. She was Aged Seventy three years and about four Months, and had been married almost Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years.</p>
               <p>Thus did this Holy Woman wear out, not rust out: Burn out, was not blown out: Yea, she flamed, not smothered out, she served God in her Generation, and then reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into that Place where is Health without Sickness: Day without Night: Plenty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Famine: Riches without Poverty: Mirth without Mourning: Singing without sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Life without Death: And these, with infinite more to all Eternity. There is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted Chastity: Unstained Honor: Unparalleld Beauty. There is the Tree of Life in the midst of this <hi>Paradise.</hi> There is the River that waters the Garden: There is the Vine flourishing, and the Pomegranate budding: There is the Banqueting House where are all those Delicacies, and Rarities wherewith God himself is delighted. There shall the Saints be adorned, as a Bride, with rare Pearls, and sparkling Diamonds of Glory. A Glory fitter to be Believed, than possible to be Discoursed. An <hi>Exceeding, Excessive, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal weight of Glory</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.) Even such a weight, as if the Body were not upheld by the Power of God, it were impossible but that it should faint under it: as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divine speaketh.</p>
               <p>After Mrs. <hi>Clarkes</hi> Decease, there was found in her Cabinet a Paper, which by frequent using, was almost worn out. It contained a Collection of these several Texts of <note place="margin">Promises to strengthen her Faith.</note> Scripture which he had recourse unto in times of Temptation, or Desertion.</p>
               <p>Who is among you that feareth the Lord: That obeyeth the Voice of his Servant: That walketh in darkness and hath no Light: Let him trust in the Name of the Lord and stay upon his God, <hi>Isa</hi> 50. 10.</p>
               <p>For the Name of the Lord is a strong Tower; The Righteous run unto it, and are safe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 10.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose Mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth on thee, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 3.</p>
               <p>Blessed is the Man that maketh the Lord his trust, <hi>Psa.</hi> 40. 4.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:62667:205"/>
               <p> Blessed is the Man to whom the Lord imputeth not Sin, <hi>Psa.</hi> 32. 2.</p>
               <p>Though our hearts may fail us, and our flesh fail us, yet God will never fail us, <hi>Psa.</hi> 73. 26.</p>
               <p>For he hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
               <p>And again: I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the Lord Almighty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
               <p>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy Transgressions for mind own sake, and will not remember thy Sins, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 25.</p>
               <p>My Grace is sufficient for thee: For my strength is made perfect in weakness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9.</p>
               <p>By Grace you are saved through Faith, and that not of you selves, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>I give unto them Eternal Life, and they shall not perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my Hand, <hi>Job</hi> 10. 28.</p>
               <p>Who are kept by the Power of God, through Faith unto Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>The foundation of God standeth sure, having this Seal; The Lord knoweth who are his, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> who walk not after the Felsh, but after the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> is the end of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
               <p>It is God that justifieth; who is he that condemneth? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34.</p>
               <p>The promise is to you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off; Even as many as the Lord our God shall call, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39.</p>
               <p>The Gifts, and Calling of God are without Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29.</p>
               <p>These Texts of Scripture having been as so many Cordials unto her in Times of Temptation, it is hoped that they may prove so to others, and therefore for their sakes they are here set down. And hereby it appears that she was not without some shakings, but through Gods Mercy, they were such as made her root the faster: And by her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and seasonable holding forth the Shield of Faith, and the Sword of the Spirit, she became more than a Conqueror, through him that had loved her.</p>
               <p>In another little Book, which was found after her Death, she gives this account of her self and of Gods gracious dealing with her.</p>
               <p>From the beginning <hi>(writes she)</hi> of Gods shewing me Mercy in my Conversion. <note place="margin">Her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I here set down Gods gracious dealings with me, not for mine own Praise, but for the Glory of God, and to stir up my Heart unto true Thankfulness for such invaluable Mercies. And then she set down the time, manner, and means of her Conversion: And afterwards proceeds thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What have been my Experiences of Gods gracious dealings with me at several times under Afflictions:</hi> As</p>
               <p>
                  <q>First when Personal Afflictions have lain upon me, in regard of Bodily Sickness or Spiritual Distempers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly. Or, Family Afflictions, when God hath taken away my dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly: Or, when I have been under fears that God would take away my dear Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by some dangerous sickness which he lay under.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fourthly, Or when I have been under great fears in the time of our Civil Wars.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fifthly, Or when I have been under spiritual Desertion, by Gods hiding his Face, and Favour from me. Or by reason of weakness, and wants in Grace: Or by reason of strong, and prevailing Corruptions. Or by reason of Satans Temptations: In all which Cases she left a memorial of Gods gracious dispensations towards her. I shall set down only a few of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It pleased God (saith she) for many years, to keep me (for the most part) in a sad and disconsolate Estate, and condition, not cleerly Evidencing the certain Assurance of his Love to my Soul: So that many times I questioned whether I was a Child of God or no: Whether I had part in <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> or no: Whether I should ever attain to Life and Salvation or no: And this made me walk with a drooping, and disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Spirit, so that I could take no true comfort in any thing: But though <hi>heaviness endured for a Night, Yet joy came in the Morning,</hi> when the Lord caused the Light of his Countenance to shine upon me, which was better than Life.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:62667:205"/>
               <p>
                  <q>It pleased God upon the Death of my youngest Child, that it lay very heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Spirit, insomuch as I was brought oft upon my Knees to beg support from God and to crave his Grace and assistance that I might not break out to speak, or act any thing whereby Gods Name might be dishonoured, or the Gospel discredited: And that he would be pleased to make up this outward loss, with some more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and spiritual Comforts. And I found a seasonable, gracious, and speedy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to these my Requests. For though I lay long under the burden of that loss, yet in this time did the Lord sweetly manifest his special Love to my Soul, assuring me that he was my gracious and reconciled Father in Christ; whereby my Love to him was much encreased, and even inflamed; so that, by his Grace, it wrought in me more diligence, and carefulness to maintain and preserve these Evidences of his Love, and to yield a holy submission unto his Will, as well in suffering, as in doing: As also by avoiding whatsoever might provoke him to withdraw the Evidences of his Love from me, without the sense whereof I could take little or no comfort in any thing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And furthermore, I bless God for it, and speak it to the praise, and glory of his rich and free Grace, my Prayers, and earnest desires have been answered, by Gods giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me comfortable Assurance, both from the Testimony of his holy word, and the witness of his Blessed Spirit, of my Eternal, and Everlasting Salvation in, and by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Yet have I not been without fears, and doubtings many times, through want of looking over my Evidences, or by neglecting to keep a narrow watch over my heart: Or from weakness of my Faith, and all through my own default and negligence. The Lord pardon it, and make me more circumspect for the time to come.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By all these I have gained this Experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>First: That God is true and faithful in making good all his Promises seasonably unto us: As, That all things shall work together for our Good. And that God will never fail us, nor forsake us <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly: That it is not in vain to wait upon God, and to seek unto him in our straits, who is more ready to hear than we are to ask.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly: That I desire to see: Yea, and the Lord hath shewed me the vanity, and incertainty of the most satisfying Comforts that this world can afford, and what an emptiness there is in them, that so I may, and I desire so to do, keep weaned affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards them and to sit loose from them, that I may be ready to part with them, when God calls them from me, or me from them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again in regard of Bodily weakness and sickness, my <hi>Experiences</hi> have been these.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>First: That as a broken Shoulder can bear no burden; so the least Distemper, when the heart is not in an holy frame and temper is a burden insupportable. If God hides his Face from us, and withdraws the Evidences of his Love, and denies to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist us by his strength, we can neither do, nor suffer any thing. And on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I found by <hi>Experience,</hi> that I could with much cheerfulness, holy submission and willingness, bear great Distempers, when I enjoyed the favour of God in them: So that then I could readily say, <hi>Good</hi> is the work of the Lord as well as is his <hi>Word.</hi> And, I <hi>will bear the Indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against him. Mich.</hi> 7. 9. And, <hi>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him. Job.</hi> 13. 15.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, I found by <hi>experience</hi> also, that by my pains and sickness I was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to <hi>Sympathize</hi> with, and to pity and pray for others in the like case.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly, Hereby I learned the more to prize Health: And that: First, Because in Health we have liberty, and opportunity to enjoy the Publick Ordinances with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Gods People, whereby the Graces of Gods people are quickned, strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and encreased in us, which otherwise (by reason of our corrupt natures) are apt to grow cold and languish, as will our bodies when they want food.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, Because in health we injoy the benefit and the comfort of sweet, and quiet sleep, which much refreshes and cheers, and which commonly we want in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thirdly, Because in Health we find sweet satisfying comfort in the use of Gods good Creatures, whereas in sickness the daintiest food is lothsome and troublesome. The consideration of these things made me the more to prize Health; To be very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for it, and the more careful to imploy, and improve Health and strength, to Gods glory, and the furtherance of mine own salvation.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:62667:206"/>
               <p> In regard of Publick Dangers I have had a great deal of <hi>Experience</hi> of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards me and mine several ways, and at several times. For</p>
               <p>
                  <q>First, When in the beginning of our Civil Wars and distractions I was sometimes overwhelmed with base and distrustful fears, occasioned by my not acting faith upon the promises, and not remembring my former <hi>Experiences,</hi> nor considering Gods love, power, and fidelity to his Children, in performing his so many gracious promises, made unto them in all estates, and conditions, and to me among the rest: Hereupon I resolved, by Gods grace and assistance not to give way to this distrust and diffidence, praying God to assist me therein, and found more courage than formerly, so far as I know mine own Heart (though truly the Heart is very deceitful, as I have found by sad experience) The Lord teach and enable me to rely upon him with more courage and constancy, and more to live by faith upon his promises than formerly I have done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Indeed I have been apt to fall into new fears upon approaching dangers; Yet upon successes, and glorious deliverances, I have oft resolved never to distrust God again, and yet my naughty heart hath deceived me, and made me ready to faint. But this I found by <hi>Experience,</hi> to the praise of my Gods free grace, that as troubles have aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, my consolations have much more abounded. For God brought seasonably into my mind many pretious promises, which were as so many sweet Cordials, which much supported and comforted my heart, and upheld my Spirit, when also new storms have arisen, and unexpected deliverances have followed, I have, and do resolve, by Gods grace, not to distrust him any more. Yea, though more and greater dangers shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, yet will I trust in, and stay my self upon him, though (as <hi>Job</hi> said) <hi>he should slay me.</hi> The good Lord establish my heart in this good and holy resolution, who is able to keep us to the end, and hath promised that he <hi>will preserve us by his power, through Faith to the Salvation of our Souls.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In regard of Satans Temptations; Especially concerning my coming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> my <hi>Experiences</hi> have been these.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Finding often that I was very unable to fit and prepare my self for a comfortable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to that Sacred Ordinance, I used to desire the Prayers of the Congregation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in my behalf, and I used the best endeavours I could in private, as God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me, though I came far short of what was required, and of what I desired: So that I did trust, and hope, through Gods mercy, to find a comfortable day of it, and to have it a Sealing Ordinance to my Soul. But on the contrary, I found much deadness, and little spiritual tast, relish, and comfort in the use of it: So that my spirit was oft much troubled, and cast down in me; fearing lest I had some secret sin undiscovered, and unrepented of, which caused the Lord thus to hide his face from me.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>But then my gracious God brought this into my mind, that the Lord doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afflict us for the exercise, and improvement of our graces, as well as to humble us for our sins. I also considered, that as the Lord doth tender great Mercies to us in this Sacrament, renewing his Covenant of grace, and sealing unto us the Pardon of our sins in the blood of <hi>Christ:</hi>
                  </q> So he gives us leave to engage our selves (by renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Covenant with him) to believe in him, and to trust upon <hi>Christ</hi> for Life and Salvation: And it pleased God to give me faith to apply this in particular to my own Soul: And a while after, to shew me, and to make good to my Soul that pretious, and comfortable promise, That though <hi>he hide his face from us for a little moment, yet with Mercy, and Loving kindness he will return to us again.</hi> This was a wonderful comfort, and support to my dejected Heart: Blessed be the Lord for ever, I desire to treasure up these <hi>Experiences,</hi> that for the future, I may resolve in the like case to put my whole trust and confidence in him, that so Satan may not entrap me in his snares through unbelief, but that I may resist <hi>him steadfast in the faith:</hi> For I am not altogether ignorant of his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</hi> Gods promise is, that <hi>in all these things we shall be more than Conquerours, through him that hath loved us:</hi> And hath said <hi>that this is the Victory which overcomes the World, even our faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
               <p>In the year 1669. There came to us the sad news of the Death of my second Son Mr. <hi>John Clarke,</hi> a godly, faithful, and painful Minister, sometimes before ejected out of the Rectory of <hi>Cotgrave</hi> in <hi>Nottingham-shire,</hi> who died the 18th. of <hi>September.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus as the Waves of the Sea follow one another, so God is pleased to exercise his Children with one Affliction after another. He sees that whilst we carry about with us this Body of sin, we have need of manifold <hi>Trials,</hi> and <hi>Temptations,</hi> as saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Apostle.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62667:206"/> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6.<hi>—now for a season ye are in heaviness (if need he) through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Temptations;</hi> to keep us under, and to make us the better to remember our selves.</p>
               <p>Indeed it hath been the Lords course and dealing with me ever since he stopped me in the way as I was posting to Hell, to raise up one Affliction or other, either inward or outward, either from Satan, the World, or from mine own corrupt Heart, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not having Grace and Wisdom to behave and carry my self as I ought under his various Dispensations and Providences, as appeared at this time by his laying so great and grievous an Affliction upon me in taking away so dear a Son, from whom I had much Soul-comfort, and ardent Affections, which he manifested by his fervent Prayers for me, and by his spiritual Letters, and Writings to me, wherein he applied himself sutably to my Comfort in those inward troubles of Heart and Spirit which lay upon me. This caused my Grief and Sorrows to take the greater hold on me, upon the loss of one who was so useful to me: Yet hereby I do not derogate from my Elder Son, from whom I have the like help, and Comfort.</p>
               <p>Upon this sad occasion my Grief grew so great that I took no pleasure of any thing in the World: But was so overwhelmed with Melancholy, and my natural strength was so abated, that little Food served my turn, and I judged that I could not live long in such a condition.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I began to examine my Heart why it should be so with me, and whether carnal and immoderate Affections were not the great Cause of my trouble, which I much feared; And having used many Arguments and laid down many reasons to my self to quiet and moderate my Passions, and yet nothing prevailed to quiet and calm my Heart, and to bow me to the Obedience of his revealed Will: And withal, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that it was God only that could quiet the Heart, and set our unruly, and carnal Affections into an holy frame and order, and, That he was a <hi>present Help in times of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> I often and earnestly sought unto the Lord with many Prayers, and Tears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching him to quiet my Heart, and to over-power and tame my unruly Affections, so as to be willing to submit unto him, and to bear his Afflicting Hand patiently and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and to be ready and willing to submit (either in doing or suffering) to whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he pleased to impose upon me: And to be ready to part with the best outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort I enjoyed whensoever he should please to call for the same.</p>
               <p>And it pleased God seasonably to hear my Prayer, to regard my Tears, and to grant my Requests, by calming, and quieting my heart, and spirit, and by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me much more contentedness to submit to his Holy Will, and good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, who is a <hi>God of judgment,</hi> and knows the fittest times and seasons to come in with refreshing comforts, and who <hi>waits to be gracious</hi> unto those that trust in him. Yet surely I was not without many Temptations in this hour of Darkness from that subtile Adversary who always stands at watch to insinuate and frame his Temptations answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to our Conditions, and like a <hi>Roaring Lyon walks about continually, seeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> poor, yet precious <hi>Souls.</hi> Then I <hi>called upon the Lord in my distress, and he answered me and delivered me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bless the Lord O my Soul; and all that is within me Praise his Holy Name.</hi> For he hath remembred me in my low and troubled estate, because <hi>his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus had new experience of Gods readiness to hear and help when I called upon him; And having found that it is not in vain <hi>to seek to, and to depend upon God in all</hi> our Straits, I could not but record these things, that so <hi>Every one that is Godly may seek unto him in a time wherein he may be found,</hi> who is a <hi>present help</hi> in times of trouble, and who doth for us <hi>abundantly above what we can ask or think.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord knows that I write these things for no other end, but that God may have the Glory, and that others, especially my Relations, may be encouraged to seek God in their Straits, and to trust in him at all times. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After her Decease there was also found in her Cabinet a Paper with this Superscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>My Will and Desire is (with the leave of my Husband) to bestow upon my Children these things as tokens of my Motherly Affections, and that I may be remembred by them. She began with her Husband, and what she gave to him and all the rest, were all wrapped up in several Papers, and each Name endorsed on the outside to whom it did belong. And then concludes all thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But above all, my Prayers unto God are, that he would especially bestow upon you, all needful</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:62667:207"/>
                  <hi>Saving Graces, whereby you may be enabled to glorifie his Great Name, in those several places and callings wherein he hath set you.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
               <p>She left also Legacies to some poor Neighbours: As also ten shillings to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> the Minister of the place, to buy him a mourning Ring: Concluding thus,</p>
               <p>If God shall please to bring me to my Grave in Peace, let this be the Text at my Funeral, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>For by Grace ye are saved, through Faith,</hi> This Scripture I was oft put upon to have recourse to in times of Temptations, and Desertion.</p>
               <p>In an other little Book she had collected sundry Texts of Scripture, which might minister grounds of great Comfort against Satans Temptations, whereby he labours, by setting before us a black Bill of our Sins, and daily Infirmities, and our great ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities to every Good Duty, to blot out our Evidences, to stagger our Faith, and to make us go heavily, and drooping in our way to Heaven.</p>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of that Excellent Lady</hi> Mary, <hi>Countess Dowager of</hi> Warwick, <hi>who died</hi> Anno Christi. 1678.</head>
               <p>THis Eminent Laday was the seventh Daughter of the Right Honourable <hi>Richard,</hi> the first Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who being born a private Gentleman, and <note place="margin">Her Parentage.</note> the younger Brother of a younger Brother, yea, to no other Inheritance then is expressed in the <hi>Motto,</hi> which his humble gratitude inscribed upon all the Palaces which he built,</p>
               <q>Gods Providence, mine Inheritance.</q>
               <p>By which Providence, and Gods blessing upon his own Prudent industry, he raised himself to such an honor and Estate, and left such a Family as never any subject in these three Kingdoms did, and (which is more) with so unspotted a Reputation of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, that the narrowest scrutiny could find nothing to except against, in all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of his rising, tho they were searched into most severely.</p>
               <p>This Noble Lord was blessed with an ample Progeny, having five Sons, whereof he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62667:210"/> lived to see four of them Lords, and Peers of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the fifth, tho not equal in Titles, yet as truly famous and honourable for his piety, parts, and learning.</p>
               <p>He had also eight Daughters, whereof the Eldest, the Lady <hi>Alice,</hi> was Married to the Lord <hi>Baramore.</hi> The second, the Lady <hi>Sarah,</hi> was Married to the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The third, the Lady <hi>Laetitia,</hi> to the Eldest Son of the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> who dyed Earl of <hi>Norwich.</hi> The fourth, the Lady <hi>Joan,</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Kildare, Primier</hi> Earl of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of the antientest House in Christendom, of that degree, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Earl being the sixth, or seven and twentieth of Lineal descent from the same.</p>
               <p>A great <hi>Antiquary</hi> hath observed, that the three Antientest Families in <hi>Europe</hi> for Nobility, are the <hi>Veres</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> Earls of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the <hi>Fitz-Geralds</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Earls of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and the <hi>Momorancies</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth, the Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> was Married to the Lord Viscount <hi>Ranelaugh.</hi> The sixth, was the Lady <hi>Dorothy Lofius.</hi> The eighth, the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> unmarried. But the seventh, our Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> which shut up, and Crowned this Noble Train, was Married to <hi>Charles,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> of whom it may be truly sayd; <hi>Many Dughters,</hi> all his Daughters <hi>did virtuously, but she surmounted them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was great by her Marriage into the Noble Family of the Earls of <hi>Warwick,</hi> which <note place="margin">Her Marriage and Character.</note> yet received accession to its <hi>Grandure</hi> by the lustre of her Name and virtues: For she was great in all natural endowments and accomplishments of Soul and body, in Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, beauty, favour and virtue.</p>
               <p>Great by her Tongue; for few Women ever used one better: For she spake so grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, promptly, discreetly, pertinently, and holily, that many <hi>admired the gracious words which proceeded out of her Mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great by being the great Mistress and Promotress of the Art of obliging; in which she attained that Soveraign perfection, that she raigned over all their hearts with whom she did converse.</p>
               <p>Great in her Nobleness of Living, and in her free, and splendid Hospitality.</p>
               <p>Great in the almost unparallelled sincerity, constant, faithful, and condescending Friendship: And for that <hi>Law of kindness</hi> which dwelt in her lips and heart.</p>
               <p>Great in the managment of her worldly Affairs, and in her great dexterity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>Great in her quickness to apprehend the difficulties of those her affairs, and to find where the pinch and stress lay; yea, to untye the knot, and to free them.</p>
               <p>Great in the Conquest of her self, and mastery over her passions; and this did in a special manner appear in her deportment at the death of her deer and only Son, wherein her behaviour was so submiss, serene, and quiet, that (with holy <hi>David)</hi> she could say: <hi>I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, because thou Lord didst it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great in a Thousand other things which the world admires; yet did she despise them all, <hi>and counted them but loss and dung in comparison of the excellency of the Knowledge of</hi> Christ Jesus <hi>our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Excellent Lady had good Education, and had been principled in the grounds <note place="margin">Her Education.</note> of <hi>Catechism</hi> in her Childhood, and yet (as she confessed) she understood nothing of the Life and Power of Godliness till some years after her Marriage. She came with prejudice, and strong apprehensions, as to matters of Religion, when she was engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into that Family, wherein afterwards she lived and dyed in so much Honour. For she was almost frighted, and discouraged with the disadvantagious report which was made of it. But when Gods Providence had brought her into it, and she came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the regular performances of Divine Worship therein; and had heard the most useful, and powerful Sermons upon the most useful, and practical points of Divinity; And withal, had observed, the good order, and Government of that Family, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived encouragment from her Right Honourable Father-in-Law, <hi>Robert,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> (who had always an extraordinary respect for her, and affection to her) her prejudice, by degrees, wore off, and an approbation followed thereupon.</p>
               <p>God was pleased to make use of two more remote means of her Conversion, namely, Afflictions, and Retirement: The kind of the first, and the occasion of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond need not here to be named. Only the divine Wisdom, and grace is very much to be admired and adored, for adapting and fitting suitable means to bring his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses to pass; as these also were in her circumstances. For she did afterwards acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that her great <hi>Remora</hi> and difficulty was her love to the pleasures, and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62667:210"/> of the world, which she neither knew how to reconcile to the strictness of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor yet could she be content to part with for that whose sweets and better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, she was not then acquainted with; God therefore gradually weaned her, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring those things more insipid and distrustful, which before had been too much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to her, and by giving leisure, and freedom from distractions, and to acquaint her self more throughly with the things of God: And hereby she was enabled to set her Seal to that Testimony which God gives to Spiritual wisdom, <hi>That all her ways are pleasantness, and all her paths are Peace.</hi> And to her friends she would freely, and frequently assure them, that she had no cause to repent the change which she found of the solid and satisfying Pleasures she met with in Religion, for those empty and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfying ones she had left in the ways of vanity: Thereby encouraging them to try, not doubting but that upon experience, they would become of the same mind.</p>
               <p>Two more immediate helps which God blessed to promote the work of grace in her <note place="margin">Her Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> heart, were; The Ministry of the word <hi>(which God hath ordained to be the Power of God to Salvation to every one that believeth, Rom.</hi> 1. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21.) and Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>Before her Conversion, her Conversation was sweet, and inoffensive, yet would she <note place="margin">Her Growth.</note> confess that her mind was vain: But afterwards she walked with God most closely, circumspectly, and accurately: And (with <hi>Mary)</hi> having <hi>chosen the better part,</hi> few have walked with God more resolutely, and devoted themselves more unreservedly to Gods Love and fear, and service, learning to be Good in good earnest, and to encrease <hi>and grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour</hi> Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>And to promote this great and excellent work, like the wise man in the Gospel <hi>[Mat.</hi> 7. 24.] she digged deep to lay her <hi>Foundation on a Rock.</hi> And she made a strict scrutiny into her Soul, and weighed the reasons and motives of this her choise in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and (with the other builder in the Gospel) <hi>she sat down and considered what it might cost her</hi> to carry on and finish her Spiritual Edifice, and whether she were furnished to defray the charges thereof. As also whether the grounds of her hope were firm, and such as <hi>would not abuse her,</hi> and shame her, and her evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for heaven, such as would bear the test, and that the sacred Scriptures would approve and own: And this she drew up at large with her own hand many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Death, judiciously, soberly, modestly, and with humility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having thus put her hand to the plough, she looked not back,</hi> but minded Religion as her business indeed; and never gave any so much as suspicion of her trifling in so serious a work. And for her practice of it, it was her great design to <hi>walk worthy of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in all well pleasing,</hi> and to adorn her <hi>Professed subjection to the Gospel,</hi> by a Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becoming it; And to shew forth his <hi>Virtues and praises, who had called her out of darkness into his marvelous Light,</hi> and had <hi>translated her into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First therefore she was circumspectly careful <hi>to abstain even from all appearance of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abstinence.</note>
                  <hi>evil;</hi> and in all doubtful cases, her rule was, to take the surest side, saying, <hi>I am sure it will do me no hurt to let such things alone.</hi> And tho none were further from censuring others or passing Judgment upon others liberties, yet for her own practice, she would never allow her self the help of artificial beauty (for she used neither patch nor paint) and was pleased with the saying of one of her Spiritual friends, upon the reading of a book which Apologizes for it <hi>(O Lord I thank thee that thou gavest me not wit enough to write such a Book, unless withal thou had'st given me Grace enough not to write)</hi> Neither would she play at any Games, because besides many other inconveniences, she judged <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> them great wasters of pretious time, of which she was always very thrifty. And tho she was known to be a Lady of good understanding, yet, she would say that there were three things which were too hard for her: and would confess that she could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them.</p>
               <p>First, how those who professed to believe an Eternal estate, and its dependances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a short inch of time, could complain of time, lying as a dead commodity upon their hands, which they were troubled how to pass away.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how Christians, who would seem devout at Church, could laugh at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for being serious out of it, and slight the very Bible, and turn Religion into a mocking-stock,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how knowing men could take care of Souls, and yet seldom come among rhem, never to look after them.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:62667:211"/>
               <p> And though, in the aforenamed particulars she was content only to give an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of forbearance; yet from the Play-Houses, since the Stage hath taken so great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, she would openly dehort her Friends, and that with the greatest earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>She, long before her decease, began to keep a <hi>Diary,</hi> and took Counsel with two, <note place="margin">A Diary.</note> whom she used to call her <hi>Souls Friends</hi> (and ever esteemed such to her best <hi>Friends)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the best manner how to mannage it. At the first, what she set down in it she used to perform in the Evenings; But finding that time inconvenient, by reason of her Lords long ilness (which gave her many inevitable diversions at that season) she changed it into the quiet, and silent morning, and for that end, she used to rise early. And therein, among other things, she used to record the daily frame of her heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God: His signal providences to her self, and sometimes also, towards others: His gracious manifestations to her soul: Returns of Prayer: Temptations prevailing, or resisted, or whatsoever might be useful for her caution, or encouragement: That might afford her matter for Thankfulness, or Humiliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by this, and such like means she had arrived to, and attained such a measure of experience, that she could conclude, or at least, make strong conjectures of the issue, and events of such things as she spread before God in prayer, and that by the frame of heart in the performance of that Duty: as might be instanced in many particulars, if it were convenient.</p>
               <p>She used to call prayer Hearts-ease, because she often found it so: And though her <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> Modesty was such, and she was so far from a vain affected ostentation of her Gifts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yet this may be affirmed, that she was mighty and fervent in Prayer, yea, constant, and abundant in it. For she sometime used her voice in prayer, and thereby hath been overheard, and her own Lord (knowing her hours of prayers) once convey'd a Grave and Godly Minister into a secret place, within hearing, who (being a man very able to judge) much admired her humble fervency: for in praying she prayed, and when she did not use an audible voice, her sighs, and groans, might be heard at a good distance from her Closet. And the very day before she died, she was shut up for above an hour, which time she spent in fervent private prayer, notwithstanding her bodily indisposition, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And indeed prayer was the Element wherein she lived, and actually died, and it was as the vital breath of her soul, and the Wing that wafted it immediately to Heaven.</p>
               <p>But if she excelled her self in any thing, as much as she excelled others in most <note place="margin">Meditation.</note> things, it was in the Divine Art of holy Meditation. This was her Master-piece. For she usually walked two hours daily in the Morning to Meditate alone, in which rare Art she was an accomplished <hi>Mistress,</hi> both in that which was set, as also Occasional. For the first, choosing some select subject, which she would press upon her heart with most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense thoughts, till she had drawn out all its juice, and nourishment: And for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, like a spiritual Bee, she would suck Honey from all Occurrences; whole Volumns of such she hath left behind her.</p>
               <p>After this Consecrating of the day with reading the Scriptures, Meditation and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and using but a short dressing, and ordering her Domestick affairs, she spent the rest of the Morning in reading some good Book, till she was called to Family Prayers in the Chappel, from which she was never absent, and at which she behaved her self with much reverence and Devotion, thereby giving an excellent example to the rest of the Family.</p>
               <p>She was a strict observer of the <hi>Lords days,</hi> which is truly, and fitly called, <hi>the Hedg and Fence of Religion:</hi> And though some please themselves in calling it <hi>Judaizing,</hi> to excuse the liberties which they indulge themselves in breaking it, yet our Church hath enjoyned all to cry to God for mercy for the breach of it, and for <hi>Grace to incline our hearts to keep the fourth Commandment,</hi> as well as any of the other nine: And it's not hard to observe, that the streams of Religion are deeper or shallower, according as these Banks are kept up or neglected.</p>
               <p>She used great Devotion when she came to the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and <note place="margin">Devotion.</note> seldom omitted to prepare her soul by solemn Fasting and Prayer, and renewing her Covenant with God at that time.</p>
               <p>And to encourage others to such a serious preparation to that sacred Ordinance, to that <hi>Dreadful Table</hi> (as S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> calls it) which she her self used before it, it will be worth the while to transcribe, and to take notice of the sweet advantages which she reaped hereby, as she her self hath left it upon Record under her own hand in her <hi>Diary,</hi> concerning one of the last Sacrament Days she ever enjoyed in this World; which is as followeth.</p>

                           <p>As soon as I awaked, I blessed God. When I had read in the Word, the Chapters of the sufferings of my blessed Saviour, I spent much time in meditating of his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love: By which thoughts I found my heart much drawn out to love him, and to be melted by his love. Then with great awful apprehensions of God upon my heart I went to pray. In which Duty, my heart was lifted up in the high praises of God, for both Spiritual and Temporal mercies: And my Affections were much drawn out in the Duty, in which my heart did follow exceeding hard after God for a nearer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in the Sacrament than ever yet I had; I then renewed my Covenant with God and made promises, that, by his Grace enabling me, I would walk more close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him for the time to come. That which in a special manner I begged of God at this Sacrament was, more love to him, more holiness, more contempt of the world, and the glories of it: that I might be more useful to the souls and bodies of my fellow Christians than formerly I had been.</p>
                           <p>Those mercies that I was in a special manner grateful for, were the Creation, and Redemption of the World; and for the Gospel, and the Covenant of Grace, and for Justification, and for some measure of Sanctification: And for so much patience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised towards me, before my Conversion. And in order to it, imbittering Creature Comforts, that I might seek for Comforts above. And for a Sanctified Affliction, and for some degree of patience to bear it; and for supports under it by the warm, and lively Comforts of the Holy Ghost. And for returns of Prayer. And for so many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to seek unto God. And for the sweet reviving hours I had enjoyed with God in solitude by Heavenly Meditations. And for the Word and Sacraments, and the sanctifying motions of Gods spirit. I was in a more than ordinary measure melted in the Duty, and shed a very great plenty of Tears in it; which when I came from, I found a longing desire to pertake of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and a great Joy that I was going to pertake of it. Then I went to Hear.—The Text was. <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh to the Father but by me,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I was attentive at that good Sermon: and by what I heard of the excellency of Christ, had my heart much warmed with Love to him.</p>
                           <p>Afterwards at the Confession before the Sacrament, I found my heart in a more than usual manner broken for my sins, which I bewailed with great plenty of Tears, and from my heart judged and loathed my self for them.</p>
                           <p>After I had received, I found my heart in an extraordinary manner warmed with love to God, and my soul did follow very hard after him to be made more holy, and for Grace to serve him better than ever yet I had done. I had very lively Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Duty, in which I received much Joy, and had sweet Communion with God in it.</p>
                           <p>After at the Table of the Lord I had given to the poor, I came from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with my heart in a sweet, grateful, and heavenly frame, and then in private I bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God for that blessed Feast, and begged strength to keep my promises I had made to God of new Obedience.</p>
                           <p>In the afternoon I heard again the same person, upon the same Text: I was in a serious, attentive frame at that good Sermon. The Subject of which was to shew, that <hi>Christ</hi> was the only way for poor penitent Sinners to come unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                           <p>I meditated upon the Sermons, and prayed them over. And had also Meditations upon the Joys of Heaven, with the thoughts of being ever freed from sin, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever with the Lord: where I should enjoy him in his fullest Love.</p>
                           <p>I found my heart much revived, and my soul did then make strong <hi>Sallies,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses</hi> after that blessed Rest.</p>
                           <p>After Family Duties were over, at which I prayed with fervency, I did before going to Bed commit my self to God.</p>
                           <closer>O Lord, I do from my soul bless thee for this sweet day, in which thou wert pleased to vouchsafe unto me, thy most unworthy Servant, more soul joy, than thou didst give for a long time before.</closer>

               <p>She was a very serious, and attentive hearer of the Word, and constantly, after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <note place="margin">Her Hearing.</note> recollected what she heard, sometimes by Writing, always thinking, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62667:212"/> it to mind that she might make it her own, and turn it into practise; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be a forgetful, fruitless <hi>Hearer</hi> only, but a <hi>doer,</hi> that <hi>she might be blessed in her deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And such she was for the external performances of Religion.</p>
               <p>And though this was beautiful and lovely, yet her chief Glory was within, in the <note place="margin">Her inward beauty.</note>
                  <hi>hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible,</hi> in that dress of Graces which adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her soul: This string was all of Orient Pearls, and evenly matched; not one of an ill water, or of an unequal size. There was not one withered limb; not one member wanting or defective in the New Creature: <hi>She was compleat in Christ;</hi> all of a piece.</p>
               <p>Her head for knowledge was comprehensive and clear, The Eye of her Faith was piercing and steady. The Ear of her Obedience was open, and swift of Hearing, and boared at the Door Posts of Wisdoms House. Her Pallat was quick and relishing, to which Gods Word was <hi>sweeter than the Honey, and the Honey-comb,</hi> and preferred by her to her <hi>necessary Food.</hi> The Cheeks of modesty were fair and ruddy. The Arms of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire were stretched out after God, and were flexible to embrace him. The hands of her Justice and Charity were strong and open. The Breasts of her Bounty were well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned, and full of Milk: And the Bowels of Compassion were tender and fruitful. Her Hunger and Thirst after Righteousness was even greedy and insatiable. The heart of her sincerity was sound and lively, and the Pulse of her Conscience smooth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual. The feet of her affections were swifter than the Roes on the Mountains of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The natural heat of her Zeal more fervent than the Coals of <hi>Juniper;</hi> And the Radical moisture of her Repentance more fluid than the Springs of <hi>Pisgah.</hi> She was seen with dry Eyes under Tear-moving circumstances, which very neerly concerned her self; and being asked how she could refrain? She replyed: <hi>I desire to weep for nothing but my sins. Her Name was as an ointment poured forth,</hi> which made her the desire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of all that were good; yea, she may fitly be called a <hi>She-Jedidiah,</hi> a female <hi>Lemuel,</hi> the Lords delight: She with whom God was.</p>
               <p>Now the soul of this excellent Body which animated all its goodly Parts within, <note place="margin">Her Love and Humility.</note> was the Love of God: And the gorgeous robe which clothed it without, was her deep humility. These were as the Sun and Moon in this great Firmament, all whose Stars were of the first magnitude, and the least of which would have been a great <hi>Luminary</hi> in an other <hi>Orb.</hi> Such was this Beauteous Spouse of <hi>Christ;</hi> so like her heavenly Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, that for that resemblance sake, we may say of her, <hi>she was exceeding lovely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was she less solicitous to make others good than to be so her self. She well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred <note place="margin">Love to other Souls.</note> our Saviours charge to S. <hi>Peter, when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren.</hi> She set her heart to promote the building of Gods Spiritual Temple, and therefore she applied her self to it with all her might. She had holy Transports for the Glory of God, and she was a great lover of souls, and these two engaged her to promote Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with her utmost industry and zeal, which that she might carry on with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantage.</p>
               <p>First, She made it her great design to represent Religion as amiable and taking, and free from Vulgar prejudice as possibly she might, and not as might affright and scare men from it; but rather, that it might allure them, and insinuate it self into their love and lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And for this end she was affable, familiar, pleasant, of a free and obliging Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, unaffected; not sowre, reserved, morese, sad, dejected, melancholy deportment, which presents Religion most disadvantagiously. She was, even naturally of a most sweet temper, and Grace inoculated into such a Stock, thrives to admiration; whereas some crabbed, peevish, sullen natures starve the best <hi>Cien</hi> they are grafted with. And she made grace and nature subservient to the good of others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, She kept her self free and disinteressed from all Parties and Factions, that <note place="margin">Her Prudence.</note> none might suspect a design of making <hi>Proselytes</hi> to any but to God.</p>
               <p>She was neither of <hi>Paul,</hi> or of <hi>Apollos,</hi> or of <hi>Cephas,</hi> but only of <hi>Christ.</hi> Her Name was <hi>Christian,</hi> and her Sirname <hi>Catholick:</hi> She had a large and unconfined Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not <note place="margin">Piety.</note> hem'd in, or pounded up within the Circle of any mans Name: <hi>But whosoever feared God and wrought Righteousness</hi> was accepted of her.</p>
               <p>She, very inossensively, regularly, and devoutly observed the Orders of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Publick Service,</hi> which she failed not to attend twice a day with exemplary Reverence; yet was she far from placing Religion in <hi>Ritual Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:62667:212"/>
               <p> She used to perfume her Company with good savoury discourse to prevent idle or worse Communication, yet not abruptly, upbraidingly, or importunely, which is very nauseous and fulsome: But she was like a spiritual stove: you might fell the heat, but not see the fire. She would drop a wise Sentence, or Moral, Holy <hi>Apothegm</hi> (with which she was excellently furnished, some of her own making, others of her Collection) that which suited with, or at least was not far remote from what was spoken, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, and commending, or improving that, she would wind about the whole discourse without offence; yea, with much satisfaction and pleasure.</p>
               <p>She kept a book of such wise, pithy Sayings, much valuing words which contained much use and worth in a little compass.</p>
               <p>Where she had particular kindness, or personal interest, she would improve the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her Friendship to gentle, but free reproof, and would argue, and perswade so stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously, that her Bow (like <hi>sonathans)</hi> seldom returned empty; and would plead the Cause of God, and of their own souls; and to whom she spake, she would do it, with such winning, and insinuating sweetness, that it was hard to resist the Spirit she spake by; and her Zeal for their good, would cause her to argue with her friends, that she might by a holy Violence attract and allure them to be good and happy.</p>
               <p>She was of an extensive Charity, and would make people good by believing them to <note place="margin">Her Charity.</note> be so, and by this engagement make them ashamed to deceive her hopes, and disappoint her expectation.</p>
               <p>She had a tender, conscientious care to provide good Ministers in places where she had any thing to do, and to encourage them, would augment their maintainance where it was small, <hi>Leez, Braintree, Foulness,</hi> &amp;c. may be her Witness in this.</p>
               <p>She had had a great care of the souls of her Servants; And her Ambition was, to be the Mistress of a Religious Family, which appeared in these particulars. <note place="margin">Family Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, In requiring their Attendance upon Gods Publick Worship, and their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Behaviour there. Her Eye surveyed her Chappel, and none could be absent but she would miss them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In personal Instruction, and familiar perswading them. There were none that served her but can Witness that she took occasions to do them good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In preparing them for, and perswading to the frequent participation of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, In laying good Books in all the common Rooms, and places of attendance, that those who waited might not lose their time, and have a Bait laid of some useful, practical Books, and fitted to their capacity, which migh catch, and imploy them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In making it the footstep to preferment. For she made the 101 <hi>Psalm</hi> the Rule of her <hi>Occonomicks:</hi> And though she treated all her Servants friendly, yet they were her Favourites which more signally feared God.</p>
               <p>She was not a First Table Christian only: She did not halt, but walked in the ways of God with both her feet. She had learned Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Lesson: <hi>That he who Loves God must love his Brother also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was exactly Righteous.</p>
               <p>Eminently Charitable.</p>
               <p>Severely Just, both in Word and Deed. Her Word was as Sacred as an Oath, and <note place="margin">Her Justice.</note> as good security as any Bond. No inconvenience to her self would make her recal or flinch from the Obligation she had brought upon her self by her own mouth. Yea, she had such an abhorrence of a dishonourable recess from express, or but intimated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, that it would render her esteem of such persons exceeding low and mean, who by little Arts and Shists would loose and free themselves from their engagements, and that would disappoint the expectations they had raised in others to save charges, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their money spared, a very poor shift, and base Redemption of their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>She abhorred a Lie, and used modestly to give this Testimony of her self: <hi>You know I</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her Truth.</note>
                  <hi>dare not: I will not Lie.</hi> And her Lord knew this so well, that though he was posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive enough, yet would he never persist, if there hapned any contest against whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver she affirmed peremptorily.</p>
               <p>And a Lye was the foulest blemish any could stain themselves with, in conversing with her, and the most unpardonable fault a Servant could contract, to whom she used to say: <hi>Tell me the truth, and I can forgive you any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About a Month before she died, she was (though then in perfect health) determined <note place="margin">Preparation for death.</note>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:62667:213"/> to alter her <hi>Will.</hi> And whereas she had before given many large Legacies in Money to persons of great quality, she said, she would alter them all, and that for this reason: <hi>They are</hi> (said she) <hi>rich, and do not need money,</hi> but she would give it in some other thing that they might keep, as memorials of her Love to them: And when she had set down all their Names in a Paper, she bethought her self what probably might be most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to each of them. For (said she) <hi>that renders a Gift most pleasing, when it suits with the fancy of the Party to whom it is given.</hi> And then surveying her own store, she resolved what to give to most of them: But not finding her self fully provided of what she might bequeath to all, she resolved to insert all in a <hi>Codicil,</hi> to be annexed to her <hi>Will:</hi> And added, <hi>I am now (God willing) going to</hi> London, <hi>when I have finished my Will, and then I will by Discourse, find out, undiscerned, what will be most pleasing to every one of them, and will provide accordingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet when the draught of her <hi>Will</hi> was made, she would put into the <hi>Will</hi> it self: <hi>For the Right Honourable, the Countess of</hi> Scarsdale, <hi>I bequeath a Set of Silver Sconses, which are in mine own Chamber.</hi> And being asked, why she would not leave the Gift to be put into the <hi>Codicil</hi> among the rest? She returned this Answer: Because (said she) <hi>She is the only person living, to whom I ever</hi> intimated that I had put her into my <hi>Will,</hi> and I would not die and have it found otherwise, and so be under the suspition of having told a Lie, or Dying with a Lie in my mouth.</p>
               <p>She had perfectly learned S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Lesson: To speak evil of no man: And where she <note place="margin">Her Prudence.</note> could not speak well, the worst injury she would do would do was to be silent, and say nothing, unless it were to some single friend, of whose prudence and taciturnity she was secured by her own experience.</p>
               <p>Nor would she invidiously diminish the just praises of any who deserved them. Nay, she would rather study to extenuate their other failings, by presenting the light side to hide the dark one. And would commend them for one good quality or action, to cover many bad ones: And would say, when others spake against them; yet I must do them this right, they are so, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or for all this.</p>
               <p>She was no less exactly just in deeds than in words. She not only gave goodly words but good performances. <note place="margin">Justice.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And because the faithful discharge of Relative Duties is one of the most signal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Righteousness, and the greatest Ornament of our holy profession, let us hear briefly how she used to acquit her self in that regard: And that first as a <hi>Wife</hi> to her Husband Living, and as an <hi>Executrix</hi> to his <hi>Will,</hi> and a <hi>Trustee</hi> to the Estate, after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease. As a Mother: As a Daughter: As a Sister: As a Friend: As a Mistress: As a Landlady: And as a Neighbour: In all which she was, as a singular blessing to all her Relations, so an eminent Example unto others.</p>
               <p>First, As a <hi>Wife: The heart of her Husband did trust in her: And she did him good, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">As a Wife.</note>
                  <hi>not evil, all the days of his Life.</hi> She was truly a <hi>Crown,</hi> and an Ornament to him. She always lived, with the sense of the Covenant of God which was betwixt them, upon her heart. She was an equal mixture of affectionate obedience, and obediential affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in her deportment towards him.</p>
               <p>Her care and endeavour was to hide, and conceal his infirmities: She deeply <hi>Sympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi> in his long, and tedious indispositions: She attended, and to her uttermost relieved him under them, with great tenderness. She loved his soul, and would both Counsel him with prudent Zeal, and pray for him with great ardor and fervency; Neither was he ever wanting in praising her. He hath with vehement protestations said: That he had rather have her with Five Thousand pounds (though she brought him much more) than any Woman living, with Twenty. Yea, when the very Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of his sorrows was at the highest for the Death of his only Son, he made That the most aggravating circumstance of his grief, That it would kill his Wife: Who (said he) is more to me than an hundred Sons. And to seal up his Love, he gave to her his whole Estate, as an honorary Testimony of his grateful esteem of her merits towards him, and left her sole <hi>Executrix:</hi> A high Testimony of his confidence in her integrity.</p>
               <p>This Trust, though it cost her very much labour, and she encountred with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficulties in the management of it, yet did she discharge it with such indefatigable pains, such scrupulous exactness, and admirable Prudence, that she failed not to perform his <hi>Will</hi> to the least tittle: So that she neither gave, nor left any occasion to any of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, though they were interressed persons; but they rather applauded, and admired
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62667:213"/> her prudent, and honourable conduct of that great Affair; which she owned, with great thankfulness unto God, as no small blessing, and mercy to her.</p>
               <p>And for that Noble Estate which was to Descend unto others after her Decease, she would not imbezel, or wrong it in the least, to have gained the disposal of the whole. And therefore was at vast Expences in Repairs upon the Mansion-House, and of Farms belonging to it, though her self was but a Tenant for Life. And it was her usual saying, <hi>That whatsoever she lost her self, she would never give occasion unto them that came after her, to say, that she had damnified the Estate, or wronged her Trust, or them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her Noble and Splendid way of living, proceeded not from Pride and Ambition, but <note place="margin">Her House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping.</note> at least principally out of Conscience: For she would not contract her Family, or make an abatement, because she would not deceive her Lords Trust, who, the rather gave her the Estate to keep up the Honor of his Name, and Family, in a place where it had long flourished, and had been famous in that kind for many years.</p>
               <p>She was an incomparable Mother, which she made to appear in the Education of <note place="margin">As a Mother.</note> her only Son, and of three Daughters committed to her Trust. For she never had but two Children of her own: one Son, the gallant, hopeful, young L. <hi>Rich,</hi> and one Daughter, who died young.</p>
               <p>Those three Excellent Ladies to whom she performed the Office, and Duties of an own Mother, though she were but an Aunt in Law to them, who by their Cousins death are become such vast Fortunes to their Husbands, being left with less plentiful Portions, even whilest her own Son lived, she would never leave pressing her Lord to make Noble Provisions for them, and to settle on them Portions answerable to their Birth, and Quality.</p>
               <p>She was a Dutiful Child to her Parents, and upon all occasions would make honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">As a Child, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Friend.</note> mention of them. She was a more endearing Sister than in a few words can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. A friend so faithful, so kind, so condescending, so free, unreserved, and unsuspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as the like is hard to be found.</p>
               <p>She was a rare and excellent Mistress, in a double care both of the Spiritual, and <note place="margin">As a Mistris.</note> Bodily welfare of her Servants, whom she as much loved to please, as other persons Servants can be to please their Mistress, it being her delight to render their Lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, easie, and pleasant, and free from discontent, that so they might serve the Lord with the greater chearfulness. And when she was to leave them, she left not off her kindness to them, or care for them, but provided to the uttermost of her power, for their comfortable subsistence, according to their rank, and time of Service with her: Giving them Noble and Liberal Legacies, to some four hundred, to others three, two, and one hundred pounds a piece: And to others eighty, seventy to buy them <hi>Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> for their Lives. To others, Fifty, Forty, Twenty, and a full years Wages to every one not specified by Name; and three Months entertainment, with Lodging, Diet, and all other accommodations, as in her Life time, to seek out, and to provide Services for themselves, before they should be removed.</p>
               <p>She was a Noble, and compassionate Land-lady, and would usually say of her Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: <note place="margin">As a Landlady</note>
                  <hi>Alas poor Creatures! they take a great deal of pains, and I love to see them thrive, and live comfortably, and I cannot endure to see them brought into straits, and therefore I would have all things made convenient for them, and if they have sustained any great losses, I would have it considered.</hi> And for her Copy-hold Tenants, she would urge earnestly the timely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of the Court Rolls, and delivery of their Copies to them, professing that she could not in Conscience suffer it to be neglected, because it was all they had to shew for their Estates.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as a Neighbour: She was so kind and courteous to them, that it advanced the Rent of the adjacent houses out of a desire to be near unto her. Her House and <note place="margin">As a Neighbour</note> Table, Her countenance and very heart was open to all persons of quality within a considerable distance; and for the meaner sort, if they were Sick, or Tempted, or in any Distress either in Body or Mind, whither they should go but to this Countess, whose Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set was always furnished with things necessary, either for <hi>Physick</hi> or <hi>Chyrurgery.</hi> And her self would visit the meanest of them, and would send Ministers unto them for their Spiritual Edification and comfort:</p>
               <p>But as her Love to God was the soul of her Religion, so her extraordiaary Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Her Charity.</note> those who needed it, was the conspicuous Crown which beautified all her sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and goodness towards Men: For in this <hi>she was forward to her power; yea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her power.</hi> For she would, upon occasion anticipate her Revenues and Incomes,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62667:214"/> rather than want wherewith to be liberal, insomuch that it was said of her: <hi>She was the Lady who would borrow money to give away.</hi> She would not live poor in Good Works that she might die Rich: Yea, though she had chosen <hi>Executors</hi> in whom her heart could trust, yet she would make her own hands her <hi>Executors,</hi> and they were very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to her enlarged heart.</p>
               <p>But to instance in some particulars. When in her Lord, and Husbands Life time, she had an allowance, setled by Articles before Marriage, she enquired of an able Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Minister, in whom she much confided about the <hi>quota pars,</hi> what proportion one is obliged to Consecrate unto God out of his Estate? He answered: That it was hard, if not impossible, to determine, or six a Rule, which might hold universally; but the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances must be considered in which persons stood; their Qualities, their Incomes, their Dependances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this, not satisfying her, she urged a more particular Answer as to her own case, what would be fit, and becoming her to do? He answered: That he supposed, a seventh part: But she replied, that she would never give less than the third part. And she made good her resolution with advantage, ever laying by her a third part for Charitable Uses, and would sometimes borrow of that which remained, to add to it, but never defalk from that to serve her own occasions, tho sometimes they were pressing enough.</p>
               <p>When she came to the possession of so great an Estate as her Lord left her for her Life, she in a good measure made true what a Great Person said: <hi>That the Earl of</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick <hi>had left all his Estate to pious uses.</hi> Meaning, that he had given it to this bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lady, who would so imploy it. And she hath professed, that all the satisfaction which she took in it, was, the opportunity it afforded her of doing good: And she hath seriously affirmed; That she would not accept of, nor be encumbred with the greatest Estate in <hi>England,</hi> if it were offered her, upon condition, not to do good to others with it.</p>
               <p>Her liberal heart devised liberal things. There are Objects of real Charity, which are not so to Vulgar Eyes or Purses, on whom she would confer, and whom she would surprise with Noble and sutable assistances: Such struck deep, and drew a whole Bag at once, but made no noise.</p>
               <p>Forreigners who were forced to exile themselves to preserve their Religion, or to embrace what they were convinced of to be the Truth, she was always open-handed to such.</p>
               <p>A great many young Scholars of hopeful promising Parts, she wholly, or in a good measure maintained in the <hi>Ʋniversities,</hi> allowing to some Thirty, to some Twenty, to some ten, to some eight, and to many five pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and to some who had more helps otherways, less.</p>
               <p>Abundance of young Children she put out to School in the Neighbouring Towns, even all that were poor, and willing to learn. Yea, her Charity in this kind reached as far as unto <hi>Wales,</hi> contributing Nobly unto that pious design, set on foot, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted with indefatigable pains and earnestness by that Reverend, Charitable, and Pious Divine Mr. <hi>Thomas Gouge.</hi> And for those poor Children about her, she did not only pay for their Schooling, but gave them Books, oft-times Clothing.</p>
               <p>Many godly Ministers, both <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> who wanted means of subsistence, and <hi>Conformists,</hi> whose Livings were so small that they could not live on them, she bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully relieved.</p>
               <p>She turned not away her Eyes, or her Ears from occasional Objects of Charity, whereof there was no want. And though she was sometimes imposed upon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by those that neither needed, nor deserved what she gave, yet did not this discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage her from giving again. For (said she) <hi>I had rather relieve ten that only appear meet Objects, and are not, than let one go unrelieved who is so indeed.</hi> She thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to seed two Drones, than to starve one Bee. For though they deceived her in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, she knew that God would not deceive her in accepting what was sincerely done for his Name sake.</p>
               <p>The poor which she fed at her Gates were very many, not only with broken meat, but with liberal provision, purposely made for them. She was full of compassion, yea, a great lover of the poor, and she built a convenient Receptacle for them at her <hi>London</hi> House (as they had one at <hi>Leez)</hi> to shelter them from the injury of Weather till they received their Dole. And during her abode at <hi>London,</hi> having no Family at <hi>Leez,</hi> yet even then were the Poor provided for there. For twice a Week there was plentiful
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62667:214"/> provision of Bread and Bief for the Poor of four adjacent Parishes: And in her <hi>Will</hi> she took order that the same should be continued for three Months after her Decease. And by her said <hi>Will</hi> she gave an hundred pounds to be distributed among the poor of <hi>Braintree, Felsted, Little Leez,</hi> and <hi>French Waltham,</hi> either at, or shortly after her Funeral.</p>
               <p>It is not doubted that every year after she came to enjoy that great Estate, she gave as much in works of Charity as would have purchased Lands sufficient to have endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Free-School, or an Alms-house. And that Pious and Liberal Foundation of <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Alms-house, which, though Founded Legally by a Patent granted under the Broad Seal for its Confirmation, by the Ancestors of this Noble Family, of which she bore the Title, being by the Death of the Founder not endowed: Yet (as all her Predecessors had done) she always gave to the Alms-people their full designed allowance, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by her last <hi>Will,</hi> that it should be so continued for a full year after her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease.</p>
               <p>This is farther very remarkable in this rare Lady, that she was not notoriously defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive <note place="margin">Her Growth in Grace.</note> in any Virtue, or Grace, but as eminent in all, as most have been in any one of them. She did abound in every Grace.</p>
               <p>She was never stained with any scandalous deformity, or sin, which was a rare mercy: For though sometimes she might slip, or stumble, she fell not; much less lay, or wallowed to defile her Garments, concerning which, hear what her self hath written.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>After God had thus savingly (I hope) wrought upon me, I went on constantly, and comfortably in my Christian course, though I had many doubts, and fears to contend with. And did truly obey that Precept, <hi>of working out my Salvation with fear and trembling;</hi> Yet God was pleased to carry me still onward. And though I, too often, broke my good Resolutions, yet did I never renounce them; and though I too often trip't in my Journey to Heaven, yet I never forsook my purpose of going thither.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Her very defects, and failings, were such as some others would have been proud of: Her Weeds would have been accounted Flowers; her Thistles, Roses in another Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. For her two great faults, for which she was blamed, by the most curious Observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of her, were</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, Excess of Charity. <note place="margin">Faults charged upon her.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, Defect of Anger. But even these admit of an <hi>Apology</hi> more easily than they need it. For</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, What was accounted excess of Charity in her, was her easiness to believe most People to be Good, or at least better than they were. She did indeed somewhat bend to this Right-hand Error: But if it were a bad effect, it proceeded from a good Cause. They that have clear, innocent, and sincere hearts themselves, are ready to judge the like of others. <hi>Charity thinketh no evil.</hi> Yet she used this her good opinion of others, as a means, and motive to make them, what she was so willing to signifie she thought them to be. And though she would never despair of any man, while she found them under the a we of Gods Authority and Word (for even those may receive some nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment who Eat against stomack; and the Sieve under the Pump may be cleansed, though it hold no Water) yet if she discerned any to scorn, or deride, and mock at the Scriptures, to despise Gods Ordinances, and to turn that which is Sacred into a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stock, she used (as her Phrase was) <hi>to set her mark upon that Man.</hi> Neither yet was she so often, nor so much mistaken in her Judgment of persons, as some supposed, who more misinterpreted her Civility, than she did the others sanctity.</p>
               <p>As for her defect of anger, which implies (if the charge be true) a want of Zeal <note place="margin">Her Zeal.</note> against Sin and Sinners, and then it is unjustly charged upon her: For though she could not, she durst not rage and storm, and vent her Anger, as some do, whose <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is a short madness</hi> (For indeed, her calm, serene, and sedate mind, and amiable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, was not capable of such furious storms, so contrary to her nature) yet would she with less noise, make deeper impressions of her displeasure for great faults, than those who appear most furious: As we see, that a still, soaking Rain wets more, than a furious, driving storm. And therefore it was observed, that if any Servant had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and been faulty, they had rather have run the <hi>Gantlet</hi> thrice, of their Lords most furious expressions, than to have been once sent for to their Ladies Closet, who treated them with soft words, but hard Arguments against their misdemeanours. Her words were
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62667:215"/> like that silent Lightning, which, without the noise of Thunder, melts the Blade, but singes not the Scabbard.</p>
               <p>What Presages she had of her approaching Death, she discovered not to any; but her preparations for it had been of a long time habitual. It was one of the most constant Subjects of her retired musings, and she used to call walks to Meditate upon it, her <hi>going to take a turn or two with Death.</hi> And surely that could never surprise, or find her unprepared, who made it her great work to be fitting her self for it.</p>
               <p>There are some passages worthy our most serious remarks concerning the watchful Eye of Gods Providence over his own <hi>Hephzibahs,</hi> alarming them to trim their Lamps (as the wise Virgins did) against the coming of the Bridegroom, and allowing them fit opportunities to do it; as in much mercy, he did unto her, as will appear by this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script taken out of her Lords <hi>Diary,</hi> containing an account how she spent the last <hi>Lords day,</hi> before she fell into her sickness, which proved mortal, and was Written but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day before she was taken ill; by which, it will be evident how God, in a most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, made some impresses upon her Soul of her approaching dissolution, though as then, there were no visible <hi>Symptomes</hi> of it upon her body.</p>

                           <p>As soon as I was up, I blessed God. Then I Meditated, and endeavoured by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Sabbath Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> of some of the great mercies of my Life, to stir up my heart to return glory to God. And those thoughts had this effect upon me, to melt my heart much by Gods Love, and to warm it with love to him.</p>
                           <p>Then I prayed, and I was enabled in that duty to pour out my soul to God, and my heart was in it, carried out to praise God, and I was large in recounting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods special mercies to me. And whilst I was doing so, I found God migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon my Spirit, and upon my heart, in a much more than ordinary manner, carried out to admire God for his goodness, and to love him: and I found his love to make great impressions upon my breast; and melting me into an unusual plenty of Tears.</p>
                           <p>Those mercies, which in a special manner I was grateful for, were the Creation, and Redemption of the World; and for the Gospel, and for the Sacraments; and for Free-Grace, and the Covenant of Grace; and for the excellent means of it which I had enjoyed; and for the great Patience God had exercised towards me before, and since my Conversion; and for Checks of Conscience when I had sinned; and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance when I had done so; and for a sanctified Affliction, and supports under it; and for so large a portion of wordly blessings.</p>
                           <p>After I had begged a blessing upon the publick Ordinances, I went to hear Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roof.</hi> His Text was, <hi>Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.</hi> And after a summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry account of the Sermon, it follows in her Book.</p>
                           <p>In the Afternoon, I heard again the same Person upon the same Text. And then follows a concise, and methodical recapitulation of that Sermon also. And after that she adds. I was in a serious and affected frame at both the Sermons, and was by them convinced of the excellency of fearing God, and of spending the remainder of the term of my life in his service. And did resolve to endeavour to spend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of my time better.</p>
                           <p>At both his Prayers I prayed with fervency. Afterwards I retired and meditated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Sermons, and prayed them over.</p>
                           <p>And I had also this Evening large Meditations of Death, and of Eternity; which thoughts had this effect upon me, to make me in an extraordinary awaked frame, in which things of another Life were much realized to me, and did make very deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions upon me; and my soul did follow hard after God for Grace to serve him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ever yet I had done. Then she concluded with this Prayer.</p>

               <p>This was Written the very last day of her health, being <hi>Monday</hi> Morning. In which we may see how God realized to her, and gave her extraordinary impressions of Death, Eternity, and the Life to come, when he was about to bring her to it. For the very next day she began to be ill of that sickness whereof she died.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:62667:215"/>
               <p> This <hi>Phaenix:</hi> This excellent Lady was far from their humours whose Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are so bad, and unquiet Company, that they hate solitude, and dare not be alone. For she loved, and even hugged her Retirements as her most pleasing hours which gave her the greatest satisfaction. And tho when she was called to it, she would deny her self, and her particular inclination to comply with a duty of a larger spread; yet she cheerfully sustained that hurry of businesses which was inevitable to the acquitting her self of the trust reposed in her, by her Lord and Husbands last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But never did Bird take Wing, when disentangled from a Net, with greater chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, nor chirp out the pleasures of its unconfined freedom, more merrily than she did solace her self, when she had escaped the noise and Croud of Worldly Affairs, which ruffled and turmoiled her quiet repose, and suspended the enjoyment of her self, and when as, in the begining of her last winter, her dearest Sister was about to leave her, the last farewel that she took of her was in these words. <hi>Now I have done my drudgery</hi> (meaning her worldly business) <hi>I will set to the renewing my preparations for Eternity.</hi> And accordingly, she made it the reiterated business of that Winter.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>March, Anno Christi.</hi> 1677. She set to the making of her <hi>Will</hi> anew, and signed, and sealed it on the twelfth day of the same month: And on <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> before <hi>Easter [March</hi> 26th. 1678.] she was take with some indisposition of body, loss of Appetite, and an Aguish distemper, whereof she had four or five fits, which yet, in that season of the year were judged both by <hi>Physitians,</hi> and her friends, like to prove more advantagious to her future health, than dangerous to her life.</p>
               <p>And in this state of body she continued, freed from her fits, both in her own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, and in her friends hopes that were about her, until <hi>Friday,</hi> the twelfth of <hi>April</hi> following, on which day she rose with good strength; and after she had sat up some time; being laid upon her Bed, she discoursed cheerfully and piously: And one of the last sentences she spoke, was this, (turning back the Curtain with her hand),</p>
               <q>Well, Ladies, if I were one hour in Heaven, I would not be again with you, as well as I love you.</q>
               <p>At this time a neighbouring Lady, having given her a kind visit, at her departure, she arose from her Bed to her Chair, and sayd, that she would go into her Bed; but she first desired that one of the Ministers that was in the House, would go to Prayer with her; and asking the Company which of them they would have? She presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved her self to have him who was going away, because the other would stay, and pray with her daily; and immediatly he being called, and come, her Ladyship sitting in her Chair by reason of her weakness (for otherwise she always kneeled) holding an Orange in her Hand to which she smelt, almost in the beginning of the Prayer, she was heard to fetch a sigh, or groan, which was esteemed <hi>Devotional,</hi> as she used to do at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other times: But a Lady, who kneeled by her, looking upon her, saw that she had lost her colour, and looked pale, and her hand hung down: Hereupon, being affrighted, <note place="margin">Her Death.</note> she started up, and all applied themselves to Minister help unto her, but all in vain. For as tho she had faln into a sweet sleep, her Soul left its earthly Mansion, and by the Holy Angels was transplanted into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom.</p>
               <p>Thus lived, and thus dyed this Right Honourable Lady: This Noble Woman: This blessed Saint: This incomparable pattern of flaming zeal for the Glory of God, and of burning Charity for the Good of Men; and that in the actual exercise of Prayer, in which duty she so often <hi>anticipated</hi> Heaven by pregustation, and which now wafted her longing Soul into the Holy of Holies, within the Vail; At the kiss of Gods Mouth (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors say, that <hi>Moses</hi> dyed) and tho not full of years, yet full of mature, and ripe fruits and graces (for she had lived long in a short time) when all men judged her worthy of more days. But God, the only unerring Judge, had made, and now found her fully ripened for a better life, and therefore translated her from this vale of Tears into his everlasting Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Thus she faithfully served and honoured God in her place, and Generation, and God likewise honoured her, according to that promise by the Prophet <hi>Samuel: Him that honours me I will honour.</hi> And that of our Blessed Saviour: <hi>He that serveth me, him will my Father honour.</hi> For God gave her Riches and Honour in abundance, as he did to <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> [2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17. 5, 6.] and yet her heart was not puffed up by them; but lifted up under them in the ways of the Lord.</p>
               <p>He gave her a Heaven upon Earth (after some trembling scruples and shiverings)
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62667:216"/> even the blessed calm of a purified, pacified, serene, and well assured Conscience.</p>
               <p>He gave her the fragrant perfume of an odoriferous Name, and of a bright, and resplendent Reputation.</p>
               <p>He gave her many dear and Cordial Friends; faithful to her as her own Soul, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, Counsel, comfort, to help, and carry her through her greatest difficulties, and most entangled affairs; concerning one of whom she used often to say with much thankfulness, <hi>that he was a Friend of God Almighties giving, even beyond her own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He gave her many great merciful deliverances: One, very like to that which <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> insists so largely upon, in his Funeral Oration for his Sister <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> the Mules in whose Chariot running away, not only bruized, but brake her bones, and yet <note place="margin">A great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</note> God miraculously restored her again. So that when the Horses in our Ladies Coach, throwing the Coach man out of his seat, ran furiously away with her, God, almost miraculously, hung the Coach against a Post in the way, whereby he stopped their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, rescued her Life from most eminent hazard, and healed the bruises which she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with safety. This happened, <hi>July</hi> 23d. 1661.</p>
               <p>He gave her a hearty Love, and affectionate esteem of all her Neighbours, so that (with <hi>Titus)</hi> she might have been fitly stiled, <hi>Deliciae humani Generis:</hi> The Delight, and Darling of her Country. And with so cheerful willingness did they delight to serve her, that you might have seen fifty brave, lusty, and gallant Teams, day after day bringing in her provisions, and that without any other invitation, than the bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the time (which also themselves would diligently enquire out) and nothing would grieve them more, than to be prevented of paying this Tribute of Honorary respect to her.</p>
               <p>He gave her such an high esteem for her prudent integrity, and discreet, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial <note place="margin">Her Justice.</note>
                  <hi>Justice,</hi> that she began to be (tho it was an imployment not usual to her sex) the Arbitress, and Umpiress of all the Controversies among her Neighbours: Many of which she happily, and succesfully reconciled, and decided their quarrels, both with wisdom and equity.</p>
               <p>He gave her the universal approbation, Love, and admiration of all that knew her, whereby that Proverb was confuted, <hi>Who hath no Enemies hath no friends.</hi> For either she had none of the former: <hi>Or her ways so pleased the Lord, that he made her Enemies to be at peace with her;</hi> For Noble and mean, Rich and Poor; Persons of all degree, and which is more, of all perswasions, paid her most kind respect, honoured, and loved her.</p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>God prevented her withe blessing of goodness, and Crowned her with loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and tender mercy. He made her glad with the light of his Countenance, and satisfied her as with Marrow and fatness. He granted the requests of her lips; and shut not out her Prayer from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He gave her time and ability to discharge her trust, and to settle her worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with honour and satisfaction: And he gave her opportunity, space, and a heart to recollect her self, and to redeem that time, which an hurry of business had deprived her of, and wherein to renew her evidences for heaven.</p>
               <p>He took out the sting of Death before she came to die, and the pains of death when she dyed, and sweetly drew up her Soul to Heaven, to be immersed in that <hi>fulness of Joy,</hi> and bathed in <hi>those Rivers of Pleasure which are at his right hand for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of Mrs.</hi> Margaret Baxter, <hi>the Wife of Mr.</hi> Richard Baxter, <hi>who died</hi> June <hi>14th.</hi> Anno Christi. 1681.</head>
               <p>MRS. <hi>Margaret Baxter</hi> was born in the County of <hi>Salop;</hi> Her Father was <note place="margin">Her Parentage.</note>
                  <hi>Frances Charleton,</hi> Esq; who was accounted one of the best Justices of the Peace in all that County. He was a grave, sober, and worthy Man: But not Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying till he was aged, dyed when his Children were very young.</p>
               <p>His Children were three, a Son and two Daughters. He had one surviving Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Robert,</hi> who after the Death of <hi>Francis,</hi> maintained a long, and costly suit for the Guardianship of his Heir: But his Wife and Good Mother <hi>[Mary]</hi> durst not trust her only Son in the hands of one that was his next heir. She thought also that nature gave her a greater interest in him than any Unkle could have.</p>
               <p>This falling out in that heat of our late <hi>Civil Wars, Robert</hi> being for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had the advantage of strength, which occasioned her to seek relief at <hi>Oxford</hi> from the King, and afterwards to Marry one Mr. <hi>Hanmer,</hi> who was also for the King, to improve her interest thereby.</p>
               <p>Her House (which was a kind of a small Castle) was made a Garrison by the Kings party: But <hi>Robert</hi> procured it to be besieged by some Parliament Soldiers, who took it by storm, where the Mother and her Children were, and saw some part of their Housing burnt, and some that were slain, lying dead before their eyes: And thus <hi>Robert</hi> got possession of the Children. But, after some time, she by her prudence and watchfulness, surprized them, and conveyed them away secretly to one Mr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> where she secured them against all their Unkle's endeavours to recover them.</p>
               <p>Those unhappy Wars being ended, and she, as Guardian, enjoying her Sons E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, managed it with as much prudence, care, and industry, as if it had been for her self, and out of it, Conscionably paid her Husbands just debts, repaired some of the Buildings which were burnt down; till her Son, Marrying, took his Estate into his own hands.</p>
               <p>Not long after, she went to <hi>Kederminster,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> (tho a stranger to her) Twenty miles distant from her, and desired him there to take an House for her alone. His answer was, that he would not be guilty of doing any thing which should separate such a Mother from her only Son, who in his youth had so much need of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and conduct: And that, if Passion in her, and any miscarriage in him, had caused a difference, that love which had carried her through so much trouble for him, should teach her with patience to bear it, rather than to withdraw her self from him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon she went back, yet shortly after returned, and took a House her self without his knowledge, or privity.</p>
               <p>She had not been long there, before her unmarried Daughter [our <hi>Margaret]</hi> came to her, who was then about seventeen, or eighteen years old, resolving not to forsake her Mother who deserved her dearest Love; yet sometimes went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to her Elder Sister, who was Married there to Mr. <hi>Ambrose Opton,</hi> at that time a <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Christ Church:</hi> At which time her good old Mother lived as a blessing among the poor, but honest Weavers of <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> who (tho strangers to her) yet for their pieties sake, were presered by her before the ruffling vanities of the world.</p>
               <p>In her younger days, Pride Vanity and Romances, and such like Company, were her delight, and an imprudent rigid Governess, whom her Mother had set over her in her absence, had done her much hurt, by possessing her with hard thoughts against strictness in Religion: Yet had she a great Reverence for some good Ministers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially for one Mr. <hi>Tho. Wright,</hi> and she thought that she was not such an one as she should be, but something better (tho she knew not what the better was) must be sought after and attained.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:62667:217"/>
               <p> With these thoughts she came to <hi>Kederminster,</hi> where she soon took scandal at the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and strict precisness of the people there, tho her great love to her Mother drew her among them: Here she attired her self in costly, and glittering Apparel, and delighted in her former <hi>Romances:</hi> But not long after she heard and understood what those bitter things were which she had thought must be attained.</p>
               <p>For being at <hi>Oxford,</hi> she heard a Sermon Preached by Mr. <hi>H. Hickman,</hi> upon that <note place="margin">Her Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Text, <hi>Isay.</hi> 27. 11. <hi>It is a people of no understanding, therefore he that made them will not save them,</hi> &amp;c. This wrought much upon her, and the Doctrine of Conversion, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and afterwards Printed by him, in his Treatise of Conversion, was received on her heart, as a Seal on the wax. Whereupon she presently fell to self-judging, frequent Reading, and Prayer, and serious thoughts about her present and future estate.</p>
               <p>A Godly, and Religious Maid that waited upon her, taking notice of this change, and of her secret duties (which she concealed all that possibly she could, as was her practise all her life time, tho to her great prejudice) she acquainted her Mother with it, who (tho before, probably, she loved her last, and least of all her Children) now began to esteem her as her <hi>Darling:</hi> And all her Religious Friends, and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, rejoyced much, and praised God for so sudden and great a change.</p>
               <p>About this time Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> Preaching upon that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Yea are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be the Spirit of God dwell in you,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he gave them sundry marks whereby they might know whether they had the <hi>Spirit of</hi> Christ <hi>or no.</hi> These she carefully set down, and among many other papers which were found after her death, this was found among the rest, wherein she had set down first the Mark, and then her self-judging, and self-condemning thoughts upon it. And at last she thus concludes.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is now evident that I am a graceless person. Tho all things be imperfect in the best, and some are more wanting in one particular than in an other: Yet where all their contraries are predominant (as they are in me) that person is told by this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that he is none of <hi>Christs.</hi> How much doth my behaviour at this time, make this to appear, when I can with an hard heart, and a dry eye, and with a steady hand, declare my self at present an heir of Everlasting wo? But the longest day will quickly come, tho I strive to put it far from me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next to this there was a full paper containing the great necessity of self-judging; the reasons for it, rules how to perform it, together with the due manner thereof, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in times of danger, before <hi>the Lords Supper,</hi> and before we presume to make any conclusions about our state of grace.</p>
               <p>These Convictions did neither dye, nor drave her into dispair: But, through Gods mercy, grew up to serious conversion, yet they put her to struggle hard against back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness to secret duties, and caused her to abandon some vanities which she had been formerly addicted to.</p>
               <p>Shortly after God seemed sharply to intertain this <hi>New Convert,</hi> for whilst her friends were rejoycing in her sudden and signal change, she was seized upon with a Cough, and seeming Consumption, insomuch as her friends began to despair of her life, and when her Country <hi>Physicians</hi> were at a nonplus what to do, they described her distemper to Dr. <hi>Prijean,</hi> and Dr. <hi>G. Bates,</hi> who both judged that it was a Consumption, and both prescribed the same Remedies, which yet prevailed nothing towards her cure; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the honest Weavers resolved to set a day apart, that by fasting and prayer they might commend her case unto God, and former experience had much encouraged them to make use of that last refuge.</p>
               <p>For they had lately prayed for one that was judged to be possessed, who was sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed. Also for their Pastor, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in a dangerous ilness, and he had speedy help. He had lately swallowed a Gold-bullet, and it lodged long in his bowels, and by no means would come away, till they met to fast and pray, and that very morning it came away. A young man that fell into a violent <hi>Epilepsy,</hi> and after great means used for a long time, remained uncured, they set to fasting and prayer (he being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) and the second day he was suddainly cured and never had fit after. In all these duties there was no Minister with them: But that day that they met to pray for Mrs. <hi>Margaret Charleton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was with them, and Compassion to her made them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fervent, and God heard them, and she was speedily delivered, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out means, or by an undesigned, and unexpected means. For, without any advise
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62667:217"/> of her own accord, she drank a large quantity of <hi>Syrup of Violets,</hi> and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Nose bled (which was altogether unusual) and her Lungs were cleered, her pulse amended, or Cough abated, and her health soon after was restored.</p>
               <p>She was naturally of a tender, and timerous nature, which was heightned by the sharp work of Repentance, under which she still lay, which she by concealing, made more burdensome.</p>
               <p>Not long after her recovery, her Mother invited all those that had so prayed for her, to keep a day of Thanksgiving for her signal Deliverance. And she being asked, what things in particular she would have them give Thanks for in her behalf? She, before they began, gave them in a Paper, what her desires were upon that account.</p>
               <p>Also the same Day she left under her hand in Writing a Paper, containing the renewal of her Covenant with God, wherein she thus Writes.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

I resolve to set my self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my Sins with all my might, and not to take its part, or to extenuate it, or to keep the Devils Counsel, as I have done, to the wronging of God and wounding of my own soul. I resolve (by Gods assistance) to set upon the practice of known duties, and not to study shifts, and evasions to put off those, which are either troublesome, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or like to render me dishonourable, or vile in the Eyes of the carnal Persons of the World: And then she set down the considerations, and reasons that moved her here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which for brevity-sake, I omit: And conclude thus.</p>

               <p>Yet she continued under great fears that she had not saving Grace, because she had not that degree of holy affections which her soul longed after. Hereupon some of her Friends Wrote Consolatory Letters to her, which she kept by her, and transcribed, for her use and support.</p>
               <p>What her striving against fear and sorrows were, she expressed in a Paper under her hand, in these words,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>April</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> The sadder my Condition is, the greater the mercy is that I am yet alive. Why then should I not give God Thanks for that, and beg the rest which yet I want? And though my Life seems a burden to me sometimes, it is my great mistake: For the greatest Afflictions are nothing to Hell Torments. Were they as great as ever any were, while I am alive, and on this side Eternity, there is hope. The time of Grace is yet continued: If I be found in Mercies way, I know not but God may yet be Gracious, and give in my soul as he hath done my Life, at his peoples Prayers. For I cannot but look on my Life as an Answer of their Prayers: And surely they desired my Life only that I might live to God; I desired it my self on no other terms.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It was my earnest request that I might not live, if not to him. Why then should I be perswaded by Satan to think, that God will not give me Grace as well as Life? May I not rather be encouraged with Patience to wait for further Mercy? It is a Mercy that I am in any measure sensible of my danger, and have any desire to be holy. I will therefore stir up my soul to Thankfulness, and to be humbled that I can be no more Thankful. I will acknowledg the Mercy that I have received, and the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of future Mercies. And this (by Gods assistance) the Devil shall not hinder me from doing.</q>

               <p>The Soul whilst it is in the body, works much according to the bodies temper and disposition. She was of an extraordinary sharp and piercing Wit. She had natural reservedness, and secrecy, which was encreased by her judging it necessary Prudence not to be open, by which means she was oft-times misunderstood, even by her nearest friends, and disappointed by those whose intent was to please her. And as she could understand others much by their looks and hints, so she expected that all should know her mind without her expressing of it: but this bred frustrations and discontents. She had a natural tenderness, and troubledness of mind upon the crossing of her just desires. Too quick, and ungovernable a sense of displeasing words and deeds.</p>
               <p>She had a diseased, unresistible timorousness, and to encrease it, she said, she was four times in danger of death; once by the small Pox: And the more to encrease it, her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house <hi>[Aply Castle]</hi> being a Garrison for the King, was stormed whilst she was in it, by the Parliament Soldiers, taken, part of the houshing burnt down, dead bodies lying
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62667:218"/> before their Eyes, and themselves stript of their Apparel, that they were enforced to borrow other. The great work upon her soul in her Conversion, which moved all her passions. Add to these her dangerous sickness, wherein she received the Sentence of death, which to so young a Convert must needs be a very awakening Providence, and coming upon her before she had attained any assurance, did the more increase her Fears.</p>
               <p>Thus living by the Church-yard side, she saw also all the Corpses that were brought to burial, and kept a dead mans Skul in her Closet, and the use of such mortifying specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, they increased her sad dispositions.</p>
               <p>Beside, the extraordinary Love she had to her Mother did increase her grief, when she expected death: And all was much increased by her Wisdom, whereby she so stifled all appearances of it, that it wrought the more inwardly, because it wanted vent.</p>
               <p>She had also keen Spirits, and their sharp blood, which caused much Head▪ach once a Month, and many times oftner, from the Age of fifteen or sixteen years: All which together, tended much to hinder her from a quiet and comfortable temper: All the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of her soul were intense and strong; and when God shewed her what Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was, she expected to have it presently in as great a measure as the highest Saint doth here attain unto; And because she had not so much as she desired, and would fain have had, she concluded that she had none in sincerity.</p>
               <p>The first discovery of her change to her Mother and Friends, was her fervent Prayers in secret. For living in a great House, whereof the middle part was ruined in the time of our Wars, she chose her a Closet in the farther end of that House, where she thought that none could hear her; yet some did over-hear, who said, that they never heard such fervent Prayes from any Person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1662. <hi>September</hi> the 10th. Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> and she were married toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Saint <hi>Bennet Fink-</hi>Church, <hi>London,</hi> having been contracted before in the presence of some Christian Friends: But before their Marriage these conditions were concluded upon. First, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> should have nothing that before Marriage was hers, that so he (who wanted no outward supplies) might not so much as seem to marry her for Covetousness. Secondly, That she should so order her affairs, that he might not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in any Law suits about the same. Thirdly, That she should expect none of his time, which his Ministireal imployment should call for.</p>
               <p>After her Marriage her sadness and melancholy vanished away, for Advise and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel contributed towards the cure of it, as did content, and imployment about Houshold Affairs; And with her Husband she lived in inviolable Love, and mutual complacency: For nineteen years after their Marriage, there was never any breach, either in point of love, or interest, save only that she somewhat grudged that he had perswaded her for quietness sake to Surrender so much of her Estate, as disabled her from helping others according to her earnest desire.</p>
               <p>But that it was not from any covetous desire, may appear by these instances.</p>
               <p>First, whereas her Portion (which was two Thousand pounds) beside what was so setled as is mentioned before, she had in her Mothers life time, lost two hundred pounds, and two hundred pounds more before her Marriage, by ill debtors, yet did she never complain, or grudg at the loss which was occasioned by poor debtors.</p>
               <p>Secondly, She knew before that the Lord Chancellor that then was, had profered, her Husband a Bishoprick, which would have stopped the Mouths of some of her Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who thought she undervalued her self by matching so low, and also might have been desirable as to the Wealth and Honor accompanying it: Yet was she so far from perswading to embrace and accept of it, that probably had he done, it would much have weakned her love, and esteem of him, though she had no prejudice against <hi>Episcopal</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For she abhorred a worldly, mercenary mind in a Minister of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another trial of her affections to Wealth and Honor was, at the fatal time when her Husband, and so many hundreds of other Godly, Learned and painful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters were cast out of their Places, and hopes of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> maintenance; exposed to scorns, and reproach, whereof her Husband had already some sense and feeling, when the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> before that, had forbid him to Preach, and the Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, his Dean, and many others had Preached fiercely against him in his own Pulpit in <hi>Kederminster.</hi> So that to choose an ejected Minister at such a time, was to expose her self to certain suffering, which in prospect, had no end on this side death.</p>
               <p>Among other troubles which her Marriage exposed her to, one was their frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movals
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62667:219"/> unto which they were necessiated: And such as have experimented what it is to take Houses, to be bound to Landlords, to fit, and furnish them, cannot but be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible both of the charge, and trouble of it.</p>
               <p>The first House they took was in <hi>Morefields,</hi> from thence they removed to an other at <hi>Acton:</hi> And after that, to an other in that Town, and soon they were necessitated to return to one of the former again. And after that to diverse others, in an other place and Country, wherein the greatest trouble is incumbent upon the Mistress of the Family.</p>
               <p>She never came to any place, but she did exceedingly win upon the affections of the Inhabitants, and Neighbourhood. If she had had so much of this worlds wealth, as she had a heart to improve it for the good of others, how much love would she have gained when she had it in so eminent a manner in her low, and meaner condition?</p>
               <p>Her deportment and carriage won her more Honor, and Love, than her Liberality. She could not endure to hear any one give to an other, sower, bitter, or hasty words: Her own Carriage was always kind, courteous, and loving to all with whom she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed.</p>
               <p>And all her kindness tended to a better end, than barely to supply peoples bodily wants, even to oblige them to some duty that might promote the good of their Souls; or to deliver them from some streights, which fill'd them with noisome cares, which became matter of great Temptation to them. If she could hire People to hear Gods Word, from <hi>Conformists,</hi> or from <hi>Non-Conformist,</hi> it answered her end and desire, and many Hundred of good Books she gave to the poor for that end.</p>
               <p>Whilst they lived at <hi>Acton,</hi> her carriage and Charity so won the People there, that she had the Love, and esteem of all. And she being earnestly desirous of doing good, fitted, and prepared her House for the entertainment of such as would come in to be instr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cted by her Husband, between the publick Morning and Evening Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, and after them. And people that had never enjoyed such opportunities, tho many of them were accounted worldly, ignorant Persons, yet gave great hopes of their Edification and Reformation, and would accompany Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to the publick. And after Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> removal, this People hearing that he wanted a House, being Ten Miles from them, they Unanimously subscribed a request to him, to return to his former House, offering very kindly to pay his Rent if he would come among them again. Surely his Wives carriage did much contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the winning upon them.</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was carried from <hi>Acton</hi> to the <hi>Common Goal,</hi> for this Instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, he never perceived his Wife to be troubled at it, but chearfully went with him into Prison, brought her best bed with her, and did much to remove the remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inconveniences of the Prison: And intruth did never live a more pleasant Life than when she continued there. And whereas people upon such occasions were not unapt to shew their liberality, it was much against her mind to receive more from them than necessity required. Only three Persons gave them just so much as paid Lawyers, and the Prison charges, and when one offered more, she refused to receive it. But all was far short of the great charges of their removal to an other Habitation.</p>
               <p>About this time the Parliament made a New and sharper <hi>Act against Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,</hi> whereupon Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was forced to remove into an other County, and his Wife removed such Goods as were moveable, from <hi>Acton</hi> to <hi>Totteridge,</hi> yet still they were engaged for that Rent of the House which they were driven from.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Totteridge</hi> few poor people suffered such hardship as she was put to: They could have no house but part of a poor Farmers, where the <hi>Chimnies</hi> did smoak so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as was very prejudicial to her health: For the smoak was so gross, that it almost choaked them: And she had ever a great straitness in her Lungs, which occasioned the smoak to be the more offensive to her. Yet such was her Charity to her poor Land-Lady, that she placed out her Son an Apprentice, who afterwards lived well.</p>
               <p>After some time they took an other House to which they removed, yet it wanted such great alterations, and reparations, as took her up much time and labor; Which yet was much alleviated by the coming, and Company of Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> and his Wife, who about that time came to live with them.</p>
               <p>When the Kings gracious <hi>Declaration</hi> came forth, which gave to <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> Licenses to Preach, and to build places to meet in: She disswaded her Husband from
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62667:219"/> removing to <hi>London</hi> till others were settled, lest he should anticipate them, or draw any Auditors, who otherwise would joyn with others, especially with their old eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pastors: But when others were setled, she than importuned him to go for the exercise of his Ministry.</p>
               <p>When they were going to <hi>London,</hi> out of a tender care of her Husbands Health, which might be prejudiced by want of a good Air, she sought out and took a most pleasant and convenient House in <hi>Southampton Square,</hi> where they continued, and in which she dyed.</p>
               <p>At her first Converson, and in the time of her sickness, she wholly devoted her self and all that she had to God, and earnestly set her self to perform those resolutions all her life after. At first she gave but the Tenth of her Income to the Poor: But her Husband soon convinced her that God was not to be stinted, but as all was his, so all must be used, for him, and to him we must give an account of all: Only we must do it in his appointed order: As</p>
               <p>1. For our own natural necessities. 2. For publick necessities. 3. For the necessities of Children, Family, and near Relations. 4. For the Godly poor. 5. Then for the necessities of the common poor. And lastly for conveniences. As for her private Charity which was great, its thought fit not to make mention of it, but to conceal it till that day wherein it shall be Proclaimed before all the world.</p>
               <p>She was earnestly desirous of winning of Souls, and of the utmost improvement of Ministers labours, to that end. We heard before how she promoted, and encouraged it at <hi>Acton,</hi> and <hi>Totteridge</hi> out of Church time: And after her coming to <hi>London,</hi> she feared that her Husband was too backward in seeking out imployment, staying till he was called: And most of the places in <hi>London</hi> being well supplyed, she questioned her Husband, what place he most desired to bestow his pains in? He answered, in Saint <hi>Martius</hi> Parish, where it was sayd, that their were forty Thousand Persons more than could come into the Church, especially among the new buldings in Saint <hi>James</hi>'s, where many of the Inhabitants live like the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> having heard no Sermon for many years.</p>
               <p>Having heard this (unknown to her Husband) she laid out to find a large and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Room, for him to Preach in; but none could be found, save diverse Rooms laid together over the <hi>Market-House;</hi> This she imployed a Friend to take, which he did.</p>
               <p>And they two importuned Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to Preach there every Morning, and in the Afternoon to get by turns the ablest Ministers, whom they could procure in <hi>London:</hi> And for that end she sent for a Minister that lived an Hundred Miles off, to come and help her Husband, to whom she engaged her self to give him forty pound <hi>per annum,</hi> to go from day to day to supply the places of such Ministers as should be so gotten as afore. The charge of this, besides paying a Clerk, and a Woman to look to the seats, rose high: part of it the people, the rest, she paid her self.</p>
               <p>From this place the Lord was pleased ere long to remove them by a strange, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a miraculous Providence. The Roof of the House was of a vast weight, and was ill contrived, the weight lying much upon one beam in the midst of the floor. The Place being greatly crouded, the beam gave so great a crack as put all the People into a great fright; But a second crack, set them all a running, and crying out at Windows for Ladders. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> reproved them for their inordinate fears, and would have gone on Preaching.</p>
               <p>Upon hearing the first crack Mrs. <hi>Baxter</hi> got down the stairs through the Croud, where others could not get that were far stronger. Being down, the first Man she met, she asked him what Profession he was of? He answered, a Carpenter. Sayd she, <hi>Can you suddenly put a prop under the middle of this beam?</hi> The Man lived hard by, had a prop ready, suddenly put it under, while all above knew nothing of it. But the Mans knocking encreased the peoples fears and cry, so that all were glad to be gone. The next Morning, they took a skilful Workman to take up the boards, and search being made, they all saw, that the beam had two great Rents in it, long and wide, and that the sound part which was left, was so slender, that it was a wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that the House fell not suddainly.</p>
               <p>This Providence increased Mrs. <hi>Baxters</hi> diseased frightfulness, and she could never get off the effects of it so long as she lived. The fear, and the marvelous deliverance made her promise to God two things.</p>
               <p>First, To keep the <hi>Anniversary</hi> memorial of it by a solemn Thanksgiving, which she did all her life after.</p>

               <p> Secondly, To build a stronger place, where they might meet with less fear and danger. And she was the deeplier affected with this danger because she was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that took the place, and occasioned their coming thither: And if eight Hundred Persons had there been maimed or lost their lives, (as the <hi>Papists</hi> were served at <hi>Black-Fryers)</hi> what a dreadful thing would it have been, and what a greivous and publick scandal?</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Baxter</hi> according to her promise, paid for the place, and presently imployed one to seek out a fit Ground, and to build an house upon it: But there was no fit ground near it, save in two places, of which one was in <hi>Oxendon street,</hi> which could not be had except she would give Thirty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> Ground-Rent, and to be at all the charge of building, and all but for a Lease, which yet was not long.</p>
               <p>To perform her promise, and desire, she imployed a friend to take it, and by request, procured among her Friends Mony wherewith to build it in the form of a Chappel: And, by ill advise was perswaded also to take the Front ground to the Street, and to build two little Houses upon it, to their great loss; all her own mony, and much more, being laid out upon them, against her inclination.</p>
               <p>When the Chappel was finished, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> Preached but one day in it, being to go on the Morrow into the Country: And it so fell out, that Mr. Secretary <hi>H. Coventry's</hi> House was on the backside of it, who resolved that they should not settle so near him. And accordingly, the next <hi>Lords Day,</hi> (Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> being from home, and having left his Wife behind him,) she procured one Mr. <hi>Siddon,</hi> a stranger, newly come up to <hi>London</hi> (an humble, pious Man, who had suffered Imprisonment under <hi>Oliver,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Kings Restauration at the rising of Sir <hi>George Booth)</hi> to Preach in that place: But Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> thinking that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would Preach, had got three <hi>Justices,</hi> with a Warrant, to apprehend him, and to send him to the Goal: But this storm fell upon Mr. <hi>Siddon:</hi> Yet after some time of his Imprisonment, the Warrant being against Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and having some other flaws in it, he had an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and by the Justice of the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Hale,</hi> and some other Judges, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased: But he being a tender Man, and Mrs. <hi>Baxter</hi> very sensible that she was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of his troubles, the burden lay upon her to maintain, visit, and chear him up, to pay the Lawyers, and his Prison Fees, all which cost her about twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. <hi>Baxter</hi> found that she could not keep up Preaching in that place, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promise, she had prepared for it, she was glad that Dr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> and his Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners would accept of it for the place of their publick worship, asking them no more Rent than she was to pay for the ground, and the Room over it for a Vestry, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing for all the money laid out for the building: Yet the purchase of the <hi>Fee simple</hi> for the Ground on which the Chappel was built, cost Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> two hundred pounds, and two hundred more for the Ground adjoining, to his great loss.</p>
               <p>Yet so much was her heart set to help the poor untaught People about S. <hi>James's,</hi> that she set up a School there to teach Children to read, and learn the <hi>Catechism,</hi> and also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved an honest poor man who taught them, who had a Wife, and many Children [Mr. <hi>Bruce]</hi> and no other means to relieve them. And she would fain have set up more, if her Purse would have held out. For this she begged a while of her good Friends, and when after some time, they seemed to grow weary, she paid him six pounds a year, mostly out of her own Purse, so long as she lived.</p>
               <p>When she found that her Husband could not make use of the Chappel which she had built, she presently hired another that was near, and ready built for gain, in <hi>Swallow-Street,</hi> that the poor People, where her Husband had begun, with considerable success, might still be instructed: But when he had continued there a while, he was kept out by some Officers, who stood at the door, with a Justice's Warrant, for many Months together. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this she referred it to divers good Ministers, to chuse such an one as would better be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured than her Husband. And a faithful, painful, self-denying man was pitched upon, who hath done much good there.</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was driven from the place, her desire was that he should go each <hi>Lords day</hi> to Preach to a Congregation of poor people there. And when Dr. <hi>Mantons</hi> place in <hi>Covent Garden</hi> was void, she desired him to Preach once a day there, because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near, many of the poor of Saint <hi>James's</hi> might come thither, which they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>She also procured from her Friends, money, wherewith to build another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Chappel, for an other Minister, among a numerous people, where much
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62667:221"/> good was, and is still done, and she promoted the building of two or three more such Places.</p>
               <p>She was much troubled to see the publick Collections, which were made for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and to pay the Rent for their Meeting houses, as sounding ill, and being also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Ignorant, and covetous, and was a trouble to the Poor, who wanted money to give, and therefore she did what possibly she could by her own purse, and her Friends to avoid it; knowing that Rent must be paid, and Ministers, with their Families must not be starved, and should not be under the cares of want.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for the first nine, or Ten years after his Ejection, never took any Gift to supply his necessities, except ten pound <hi>per annum</hi> from Serjeant <hi>Fountain,</hi> which his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> modesty would not suffer him to refuse. And this was so far from troubling his Wife, that it was altogether according to her mind and desire.</p>
               <p>It was a great Testimonial of her Piety and Charity, that when her own Estate prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much too short to maintain her in the exercise of such good Works as she was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to, she refused not to accept thankfully the Liberality of others, and her self to live partly upon Charity, that she might be enabled to open her hands to such poor as could not so easily get it from others as they could.</p>
               <p>When Warrants were out from a Justice of Peace to distrain of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Goods for Fines for his Preaching, she did encourage her Husband to undergo the loss without repining, and underwent the trouble her self of removing, and hiding his Library that it might not be distrained, and some time after she freely gave it away, partly to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>New England,</hi> the rest at home. And his danger of paying forty pounds for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sermon, besides imprisonment, was so far from inclining her to discourage him from his Office-Work, that if she did but suspect that he feared, or was doubtful what to do, it was so great a trouble to her that she could not conceal it.</p>
               <p>Her expectation of liberality to the poor from others was too high, and she was too much troubled at the backwardness of some. When she saw a worthy person in debt, or in Prison, she would promise to gather him such a sum of money, and when it came short, she was sain to pay the most of it her self. Not long before her Death she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to get twenty pound more towards the relief of one of known Name, and Worth, and when she could get but about 8 <hi>l.</hi> she made it up her self: Many poor Widdows and others thought they lost a Mother when they lost her.</p>
               <p>To her Husbands poor Kindred she was liberal, but not to maintain them in idleness, but to set them to Trade, or to help them out of great straights. To her own Kindred she did bear a very tender love; And she prevailed with her Husband to be the Motioner of a Wife to her only Brother, which was sayd to be worth twenty thousand pounds to him; and her Sisters Children she loved as if they had been her own, especially her three Daughters.</p>
               <p>She had in her youth been tempted to doubt of the Life to come, and of the truth of the Scriptures: But she was so fully settled, and resoved herein, that the confident As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of it, was the life of all her life, and practice.</p>
               <p>After all the doubts of her sincerity, and Salvation, and all her fears, and sadness thereupon, she so far overcame them all, that for near nineteen years that she lived in a Married Estate, her Husband scarse ever heard her to speak a doubting word of her Salvation; but oft of her hopeful perswasion, that they should live together in Heaven for ever.</p>
               <p>Her former saying was, that if she were but in a condition, in which Gods service was costly to her, it would make her know whether she were sincere or not: And she had her desire, and proved her sincerity by her constliest Obedience. For it cost her, not only her labour, and Estate, but somewhat of her trouble of body and mind. For her Knife was too keen and cut the sheath. Her desires were more earnestly set on doing good, than her tender mind and head could well bear: Her great infirmity was the four Passions of Love, desire and trouble of mind. Of anger she had very little, or little made it known: She rarely spake in an angry manner. She could not well bear to hear one speak loud, or hastily, or eagerly, or angerly, even to such as deserved it.</p>
               <p>She as much disliked the silencing of so many Ministers as any other could, but she did not love to hear it much complained of, save as the publick loss: Nor to hear <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi> talked against as a party: Nor the faults of the Consciencious sort of them ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated in a factious, siding manner.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:62667:222"/>
               <p> She had a diseased fearfulness, against which she had little more Free-will, or Power, than a Man in an Ague fit, hath against shaking. Her nature was prone to it; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sad accidents, together with trouble of mind made them her malady: Namely.</p>

               </list>
               <p>She dreamed much of Fire, and Murders, and these dreams much augmented her Fears; so that she could not endure the clapping of a Door, nor any sudden noise, or that had fierceness in it. Yet by the power of Grace she had overcome most of her Fear of Hell, and of Gods desertion, and was very free from the Fears of Persecution, Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of Losses, and Poverty, few attaining to the like.</p>
               <p>She had earnest desire after the Conversion and Salvation of her Servants, and she was much troubled that so many of them (though tolerable for doing their work) yet went away ignorant, and strangers to true Godliness. And such as were truly Converted she loved as Children.</p>
               <p>She used to say, that she had imprinted on her a deep hatred, and fear of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,</hi> which much hindred her from performing the outside of her duty, especially, as to the speaking part. There were very few abler to speak long, and to cloth their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with good Language, without Repetitions, even about Religion: and few that had more desire that it should be well done: And yet she could not do it her self for fear of seeming guilty of Ostentation. In good Company she spake little of that which she most desired to hear; In her Husbands absence, she would not pray in her Family, tho she could perform it very well, for fear of <hi>Hypocrisie:</hi> Yet she would privately confer with her servants, and read good Books to them.</p>
               <p>She would often say: Its a great mercy of God, never to know what will befall us in this world; Nor how we shall be sick, or die, that our knowledg may not anticipate our sorrows, tho in the general we should be always ready.</p>
               <p>She was a great honourer of her Mother, and loved her most sincerely. She believed the Promise in the fifth Commandment, and believed that it implied an answerable Curse to them that broke it, according to those Scriptures, <hi>Prov</hi> 30. 17. <hi>the Eye that mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at his Father,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 16. <hi>Cursed be he that setteth light by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>She was much troubled with a great pain in her Head, which held her from her youth two or three days every fortnight, and upon every occasion that did irritate the matter, she had a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onstant straitness in her Lungs, a great incapacity of much exercise, motion, or any heating thing.</p>
               <p>About three years before her decease, by the ill advise of a Friend, drinking against the Collick a spoonful of powder of Ginger, every morning for near a quarter of a year together, and then falling into some overwhelming thoughts, it overthrew her head for some few days, but through Gods mercy, she was soon restored again.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:62667:222"/>
               <p> Ever since that time her Head-ach abated, and she complained of a pain in one of her Breasts, which through her timerousness filled her with fears that it would prove a <hi>Cancer:</hi> And several Neighbours, Friends, and Relations about that time dying of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> increased her Fears: Yet she seemed to be prepared chearfully to undergo it.</p>
               <p>The many rumours of Plots, Firings, Massacres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much encreased her fears: And the death of very many Neighbours: Some of them young, strong, and choise Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of great usefulness, and many near Friends, did greatly add to her sadness, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of death. But little of this appeared unto others, for she purposely carried it chearfully, and merrily with her Friends, when yet she was troubled within.</p>
               <p>About ten weeks before her last sickness, most of her pain went out of her Breast, and fixed in a constant pain in her right Kidney, and withal, her Urine stopt, and little (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively) came from her for about ten Weeks. Some things which she took did work too powerfully upon her Brain, and suddenly cast her into a strong disturbance, and <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> in which though the <hi>Physitians</hi> with great kindness and care, did omit nothing in their power, yet she died the Twelfth day after. She fell sick on <hi>Friday, June</hi> 3. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1681. and died <hi>June</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Though her understanding was never perfectly restored, yet she had a very strong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the affecting passages of her Life, from her very Childhood: Mrs. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> (whom she dearly loved, and had newly gotten her into her house to be her Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) with some others being present; she said to her Husband, my Mother is in Heaven, and Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> is in Heaven, and Thou and I shall be in Heaven.</p>
               <p>She did oft make it appear that her soul did work strongly towards God, and (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of her head) she cried out, <hi>Lord, make me to know what I have done, for which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo all this? Lord I submit: God chooses best for me.</hi> She requested her Husband to Pray by her, and quietly joined with them to the end. She heard divers <hi>Psalms,</hi> and a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Read, and repeated some part of what she heard, and Sung part of a <hi>Psalm.</hi> The last words that she spake were these: <hi>My God help me, Lord have mercy upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was buried <hi>June</hi> 17. in <hi>Christs-Church,</hi> in the Ruines in her Mothers Grave: On which she had caused a fair, rich, and large Marble Stone to be laid, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1661. about twenty years before: upon which her Husband had caused to be written her Titles, and some <hi>Latin</hi> Verses, and these <hi>English</hi> ones.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus must thy Flesh to silent Dust descend,</l>
                  <l>Thy Mirth, and Worldly Pleasures thus will end:</l>

               <p>But <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Church</hi> on Earth is liable to those changes of which the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> above is in no danger. In the doleful Flames of <hi>London</hi> 1666, this Church among many others, being burnt, the Roof of it falling, broke this great Marble Stone all to pieces, and it proved no lasting Monument: But this Paper Monument, is like to be more durable than was that Marble Stone.</p>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of the Lady</hi> Mary Armyne, <hi>who Dyed</hi> Anno Christi. 1675:</head>
               <p>THIS Honourable and Excellent Lady, was a branch of one of the most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, <note place="margin">Her Parentage.</note> Noble and Illustrious Families in <hi>England,</hi> whether we look to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, Degree, or Actings; The Family of the <hi>Talbots,</hi> for a long Tract of time, Earls of <hi>Sbrewsbury,</hi> whose <hi>Heroick</hi> performances, both in <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Affairs, done by them in their Native Country, are upon Record to the perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Names, and Renown.</p>
               <p>But especially their Conquests, and Tryumphs in <hi>France</hi> were so signal, that the Memory of them continues until this day, and withal so dreadful, that Mothers quieted their crying Children by telling them that <hi>Talbot</hi> came. And to be Children of such Nobles, is Honourable, even in sacred Writ, (which usually overlooks such <hi>minute</hi> things) and especially when they are found in the way of Righteousness, as in this pious Lady.</p>
               <p>As to her Feature and beauty, it was more considerable even unto old age, than in <note place="margin">Her Beauty.</note> most of her date in the world, by which we may judge what it was in the spring of her life. And</p>

               </q>
               <p>She was of a lively and Active Spirit; and herein she was much above ordinary▪ <note place="margin">Active and Healthful.</note> For even to the close of her days, she was very active and stirring; able to walk with agility and continuance, without help of hand, or staff.</p>
               <p>As to her natural parts, she was quick, vivacious, and comprehensive in Judging <note place="margin">Her Prudence.</note> of things even to the last hour of her Life: Tho she was considerably above fourscore
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62667:223"/> years old, yet could she discourse as rationally, the very day she died, as others can in the very flourish of their Age and Life: Neither yet was this only a lightning before her death; for she was the same all the time of her weakness even to the last. Now as Rationality raises men above Beasts; so the higher use that any have of it, the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they approach to the blessed Angels. And indeed these excellent endowments highly advance men beyond those imaginary ones of Riches, Honors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus some of the old <hi>Philosophers</hi> (tho poor and mean in the World) did wonderfully tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend and excel the great Conquerors, whose Name were dreadful in the World. Thus have we a brief account of her Priviledges, and natural Accomplishments.</p>
               <p>Next let us hear, and consider what her acquired parts and endowments were.</p>
               <p>First, in general: She had attained to a great skill and dexterity in the knowledg of all those things which belonged to her Sex, Degree, and Place, which were very numerous, and therefore required such attainments as she had in an high measure arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, which also appeared in these perticulars.</p>
               <p>1. She was not without some competent skill in more Languages than her Native <note place="margin">Learning.</note> Tongue: particularly, in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

In <hi>History</hi> she was well versed, not only in the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Histories; but especially in the <hi>Historical</hi> part of the Sacred Scriptures, and <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> affairs. And as to both of them, many may and do speak with much more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but with far less Skill and Judgment, than she used to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> She was one, who well understood how to manage her affairs and concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>4ly.</hi> She was of a very obliging deportment, and carriage to the utmost date of her life. In this she was a <hi>Critick:</hi> Few could excel or go beyond her. With her humble and courteous carriage and Speeches, she obliged all with whom she conversed, or had to do. For as she was the owner of an active Body, so of pertinent and pleasing speech, even to the end of her days, and this dexterity she used to imploy in the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Friends and Visiters, both in health and sickness. And truly this peice of humanity, or candor, is a very lovely thing, much commended to us in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, both of the <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>New Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Grace, without which all afore-mentioned had been but perishing accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments, only Ornaments in meer humanity. Some persons <hi>beyondsea men,</hi> have nervously attempted to prove, that it is only Religion, and not meer Reason that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenceth men from Beasts.</p>
               <p>This honourable Lady was of a holy, and exemplary Life. She used to affirm, that a holy Life, and Graces of the Gospel did far excel, and were more dignifying than Birth, Estate, and then all the great and shining Titles which the World could bestow. She was of the mind, and judgment of that godly Emperor <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who used to say, that he accounted himself more honoured by being a Christian than by being Emperor of <hi>Rome:</hi> And she used to say, That what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, was a great Truth, upon her long Observation and Experience: <hi>Not many Wise Men after the Flesh, not many mighty, not many Noble are called,</hi> [1 Cor. 1. 26.] She was also often heard to affirm: That the new Birth deserves to be (as undoubtedly it is) in highest, and greatest esteem. <hi>Born, not of blood, nor of the will of the Flesh, nor of the will of Man, but of God,</hi> [1 Joh. 1. 13.]</p>
               <p>Through Gods goodness this pious and excellent Lady was not like a fair house with an ill inhabitant, but had a noble Soul, which dignified all her other excellencies. The many other things raised her to an high pitch of greatness, yet none did so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and beautifie her as her Religion. And that which made it the more Orient, and splendid was its Regularity, Universality and Perseverence.</p>
               <p>More particularly, her Religion and Grace appeared in these six things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that she loved it in others. She loved those that led a godly and gracious life: And Saint <hi>John</hi> makes this an infallible mark or Testimony of a gracious Person: <hi>By this we know that we are passed from death to life because we love the Brethren. He that loveth not his Brother abideth in darkness,</hi> [1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 14.] She affected not, nor indeed could be at ease in evil and bad company. She could, in a good measure say with the holy Prophet <hi>David, The Saints, and they that Excel, in these is all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> [Psal. 16. 3.] <hi>And I am a companion to all them that fear thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>[Psal.</hi> 119.]
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62667:224"/> She loved holiness, not only in those of her Family (choosing her Servants by this Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard) But also in Strangers, which was a good Evidence that she loved it for its own sake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that she really endeavoured to promote and advance Religion in others, not only by Counsel, Conference, Admonition, Exhortation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But also by many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Letters written with her own Hands; She used to give good Books to some, and Money to others to draw on, and encourage them in their progress towards the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. She gave large yearly Contributions to promote the carrying on of the work begun in <hi>New England</hi> for the Conversion of the poor <hi>Indians</hi> in those parts: And this she continued, even to her dying day. And of the success of that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, she had an annual Account to her rejoycing.</p>
               <p>When that fatal <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day came, wherein so many hundreds of godly, able, and painful Ministers were ejected, to the undoing of themselves, their Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all other ways being prohibited whereby they might get a subsistance; out of <hi>Sympathy,</hi> and commiseration of their sad, and deplorable Condition, some few days after, she came to Mr. <hi>Edm. Calamy,</hi> and brought him five hundred pounds (at which time I also was with him) to be distributed among the most indigent, and necessitous Families of them.</p>
               <p>She was ready to embrace, yea joyful for any opportunity of serving God in publick or private, upon ordinary, or extraordinary occasions. She could truly say with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet <hi>David: I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord,</hi> [Psal. 122. 1.] She was as eagerly bent, and forward to joyn in holy duties, and Ordinances, as others are, or can be to run after worldly Vanities.</p>
               <p>She did highly reverence, and esteem godly Minsters, yea, she had great respect to such of them as were of the lower Form, and of meaner Gifts, if she observed them to be serious, and industrious. She demeaned her self with very much gravity, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Gods house of Prayer. She never mentioned the Names of God or of <hi>Christ,</hi> but with a reverential awe upon her Spirit.</p>
               <p>Her Speeches and discourse alwayes dropped as an <hi>Hony-comb:</hi> It was always <hi>savou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and seasoned with Salt, fit to Minister grace to the Hearers,</hi> according to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> advise, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>She was frequent and constant in giving to Charitable uses. She in her life time, erected, and endowed some Alms-houses in three several Counties: And upon special occasions, gave away many large sums of money upon charitable accounts. She was <hi>not weary in well doing</hi> whilst she lived, and at her death, she left Forty pounds <hi>per annum</hi> for Fourscore and Nineteen years for the like uses.</p>
               <p>She was always constant in her secret devotions of reading the Sacred Scripture (wherein was her delight) and other choice Books; And private Prayer, at least twice a Day, which course she continued to the close of her dayes.</p>
               <p>In her last sickness whereof she died, she shewed some notable Testimonies of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of her Graces, and Religion.</p>
               <p>First, In the servour of her Spirit to continue in well doing even to the last of her life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In her breathing after <hi>Christ,</hi> and desiring to be <hi>dissolved and to be with him, which is best of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In her warm, and bleeding sense of the low estate and condition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Profession of it in the World. Her <hi>heart trembled for the Ark of God,</hi> as did <hi>Eli's,</hi> 1 Sam. 4. 13.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In her submission to the Divine Will and Disposal. She freely offered up her self to her great Lord and Owner, to do with her, as for Life or Death, as he pleased.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In her peace of Conscience, and freedom from Satanical Molestations and Temptations. In former Sicknesses she had enjoyed much serenity, but never had a more peaceable and submiss frame of soul than at this time. So that in her that Text of Scripture was made plain and true. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: For the End of that man is peace,</hi> Psal. 37. 37.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, In the strength of her Faith, appearing by her commending <hi>Christ</hi> as the highest, and most proper Cordial in a fainting hour when all comforts forsake us, which were some of her last words before her death.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In the continuance of her fervent Prayers, in the midst whereof she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed up her Spirit unto God.</p>
               <p>A Learned, and Experienced Minister, who lived not far from her, was sometimes with her. The occasion of his going, and his business with her, cannot be better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed then in his own words, which I will therefore here set down.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:62667:224"/>
               <p> Tho (saith he) I was seldom with her my self, yet these fifteen years I lived so near unto her, as that I might easily have heard the noise of Fame, if she had laid under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner of scandal: But such was her holy and blameless Life, that obtrectation it self durst not so much as nibble at it.</p>
               <p>That little converse I had with her gave me opportunity to know her more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, than many, that did but see her blameless, and pious Conversation. For her business with me was no other than to open the State of her Soul, and to confess her infirmities, and to produce her evidences for Heaven, and to desire my Judgment of them, together with my Counsel for her further strength and comfort: And to ask my advice concerning such works of publick Good, which she charitably intended, and did afterwards liberally perform.</p>
               <p>Upon trial I found that she had a safe and well setled State of Soul; not free from all degrees of Fears, and lesser doubtings of her self: And far from a presumptuous, unhumbled, and self-justifying. But her evidences were sound, and her discerning of them was so clear and sure, as enabled her to conclude her Right to everlasting Life, and so with the greater peace to think on Death: which, as she had opened to me not long before, so did she it over again at large in her Sickness, not many days before her Death.</p>
               <p>At which time, after complaints for such imperfections of Grace as were her trouble, she professed the full Dedication of her self to God, her firm consent to the terms of his Covenant, and her longings after perfect holiness, and her trust in the Merits and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of her Redeemer.</p>
               <p>After this those about her had some hopes of her recovery, but she hearing of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> troubles, sent her Servant to him to hear of his Case, before whose return to her, she was dead.</p>
               <p>As she lived to God, so God gave her a long life accompanied with many and great Mercies. Tho she had been long troubled with a sore and dangerous disease [void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stones by the Intestines, supposed to come from the Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>] and which had pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and perilous <hi>Paroxyms,</hi> and <hi>Critical</hi> Fits; yet it pleased God in her later years to give her great ease, and freedom from it. Tho it is not unlike, that it was the Root of that fainting Aguishness which put a period to her days. Yet to near the fourscourth year of her Age she served God in competent health, and serenity of mind.</p>
               <p>Tho she sprang from an Ancient and Honourable Family, inclined to the <hi>Romish</hi> Sect, yet God was her Teacher, and did confirm her, not only in the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but also in the true love of practice, and seriousness in that Religion which she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est. She was not like those deluded <hi>Formalists,</hi> who contend most furiously for this Religion against that, or for that against this, while in truth they are of none. And with zealous <hi>Papists,</hi> or zealous <hi>Protestants,</hi> or zealous in more singular Sects, but will never be perswaded to be zealous Christians. They will furiously Persecute, or at least Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach those that are not of their Church, or Side, or Way, as Erroneous, Irreligious Persons, while nothing can prevail with them to be themselves on <hi>Christs</hi> side a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Flesh, the World, and the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But she was not addicted to Sects, or Novelties upon pretence of rising to the highest Form; but she truly took the heigth of her Religion to consist in the heigth of Love to God and Man, and in close and constant obedience unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and confidence in his Mediation. And they that do so with all their hearts shall have sound and durable Comfort, which will bear them up both in Life and in Death: Whilst the formal, <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> and superstitious Hypocrite, hath a Consolation which will live, and die with his prosperity, or which is heartless and delusory, as living but on the flattery of himself or of his party.</p>
               <p>Tho according to her Rank, she lived in the Decency of a plentiful Estate, it was accompanied with Humility, and lowliness of mind. Her Prudence, Sobriety, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity were very Exemplary; and her Impartiality in loving all that were truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians was signal. Yet she much disliked their Divisions, and contentious wranglings. She was not of their mind, who take it to be a mark of <hi>Christs</hi> Disciples, to be Accusers of the Brethren, and to Reproach, and Villifie, and Persecute his Disciples, and to deny them tobe his, that they may do these things with less dishonor, and remorse.</p>
               <p>She took it to be no countenancing of <hi>Schism</hi> (as some do) to relieve such Servants of <hi>Christ</hi> in their distress, as men accuse and afflict as <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> tho she was an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to real <hi>Schism.</hi> When she first heard of above eighteen hundred Ministers ejected,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62667:225"/> and silenced, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1662, and deprived of all ways, and means of subsistance for themselves and families, She gave freely a considerable Sum of money towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of the most necessitous of them (as I have shewed before) and the good works which she did before her death, we hope will live, and declare themselves, and be an encouragement to others, that are intrusted by God with Riches, to follow her Example, and so make themselves <hi>Friends of the Mammon of Ʋnrighteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To live as this honourable, and excellent Lady did, in Gravity, Prudence, Humility Temperance, and in a Charitable, Peaceable, impartial Religiousness; Studying the, Realities, even God and her Redeemer, Grace, and Glory, and her own Heart, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and how to do Good, and to prepare for her day of account, will prove more safe, and comfortable at the last, than the Proud, Wrathful, Turbulent Religion of such, as strive to set up the Church and Christ (they mean in truth themselves) by Persecution, or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by hurting or destroying their Fellow Christians, or Reproaching them, and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as unworthy their Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>The Life and Death of the Right Honourable, the Lady</hi> Elizabeth Langham, <hi>who died,</hi> Anno Christi, 1664.</head>
               <p>THE descent of this eminently pious Lady was from a Noble Family; the <note place="margin">Her Parentage.</note> House of <hi>Huntington,</hi> the Earldom whereof hath continued long in the name of <hi>Hastings,</hi> and, in the person of her Brother, sets its foot upon the seventh round of the Scale of Honour; yet this humble Lady was never known, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in word or deportment to shew any elation of Spirit upon that account: Nor was she ever observed, with regret, to behold herself exceeded by the vain pomp, and <note place="margin">Her humility.</note> more splendid Retinue of diverse, that were inferiour to her in quality. Yea, when her Husband, [Sir <hi>James Langham]</hi> sometimes modestly excused the tenuity of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition she had espoused (by marrying where she found an Heir in being to a great part of his estate) in comparison of what she descended from: She would interrupt such discourse, professing the high satisfaction she took to find herself in such a state of life, wherein she had both liberty and assistance to the works of severe Piety; and withal the addition of an Honourable and comfortable worldly competency.</p>
               <p>Her Education was in a School or rather <hi>Acaedemy</hi> of Learning, and <hi>Nursery</hi> of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; <note place="margin">Her Education.</note> namely the constant inspection and converse of her vigilant Mother, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess of <hi>Huntington,</hi> from whose great parts and Graces, she was formed into a more than ordinary Woman and Christian. Under her (mostly) she injoyed an Education in a religious retiredness, which she often took notice of, and blessed God for, as that which not only secured her from the knowledge of Vice by Domestical examples (no such thing daring to appear under that Noble Ladies Government) but also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved her from the very News of those evils which were acted abroad: So that she had the happiness to be ignorant of the vitiousness of other great Personages, even by hear-say.</p>
               <p>As for those principles, that might qualifie her for a vertuous life, as she had the opportunity of learning them from the practices of those with whom she conversed, so (cheifly) from the grave and frequent instructions of her Lady-Mother, who, that the whole compass of her duty might be the more facily and firmly imprinted in her memory, took the pains to digest all into verse, whereby she the more easily insinuated them into the hearts and heads both of this and her other Lady-Sisters.</p>
               <p>By this means it pleased God that the Mother had much comfort in all her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but especially in this Lady, whose Soul was so pliable and ductile to receive the impressions of so excellent a stamp, as appear'd by the proportionable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which she attained in every stage of her life; as we shall hear by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For her Childhood, which tender Age had something of rare excellency in it, <note place="margin">Her childhood.</note> besides the presage of what it promised for the future. St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself noted it as a rare thing in young <hi>Timothy,</hi> that from a <hi>very Suckling he had known the Scriptures,</hi> (2 Tim. 3. 15.) Nor was it less to be noted in this excellent Lady, how early the seeds of true Piety and Devotion put forth and shewed themselves: Not only in the <note place="margin">Her early growth in Grace.</note> blade but blossom also and fruit, insomuch that from a Child, such impression of the fear of God possess'd her heart, as made her a diligent performer of religious Duties, and a strict observer of the Lords dayes, even to a degree of exactness beyond most Persons, and yet not beyond the Rule set down, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 13. in so much, that she would neither discourse, nor willingly hear others discoursing of any common ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary matters upon that <hi>Holy Day.</hi> And as she grew to more capacity, so to this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative strictness, she added a positive conformity to the rules of severest godliness: Not only by a diligent hearing of the Word preached, but digesting it by Meditation and Conference; being no less studious (on that day especially) to learn the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of practical Godliness, than in those of the rest of the week to furnish herself with what other knowledge tended to civil accomplishments.</p>
               <p>She was also from her Infancy ever conscientiously dutiful, and obedient to her <note place="margin">Her dutifulness to her Parents.</note>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:62667:226"/> Parents (yea to the very smallest <hi>punctilio's)</hi> wherein so ever she had the least intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their pleasure: Insomuch as her Lady-Mother, upon a special occasion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her, from the misapprehension of some advice she gave her, to be more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected than she desired, was fain to expound herself to her, and to give this as a general Rule to her, <hi>That sundry things, which she had spoken to her, were never intended as peremptory Commands, but only as Advices and Counsels, which, in things of Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, must not be overcharged.</hi> Yea, her Lady-Mother hath been heard to say, <hi>That she was the Child that never offendeded her in all her Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As she grew to more maturity of years, she was observed to be precise in <note place="margin">Her Justice.</note> Justice and exactness of keeping her Word; which, that she might be the better enabled unto, she was very circumspect and sparing of making Promises, and not lavish of Discourse; a quality, which undoubtedly kept her from much Sin, which <note place="margin">Her taciturnity</note> is not wanting <hi>in multitude of words (Prov.</hi> 10. 19.) which also contributed much to her perfection, which (as the Apostle St. <hi>James</hi> tells us) doth much consist in the Government of the Tongue <hi>(Jam.</hi> 3. 2.) She spake much with herself, and little unto others; insomuch that a Noble Person, of a very discerning Judgment, and no less a severe Piety, who had the advantage of being a Witness to almost all her Life, hath been heard to say, <hi>That she believed this Lady had the least account to give for words of any that ever she knew.</hi> Yet she laid not this restraint upon her Tongue for want of Abilities to discourse, or for want of Matter to discourse of: For she had great intellectual accomplishments, and those improved by much secular Learning, whereby she was enabled to converse with Persons of eminent Scholarship.</p>
               <p>She was exceeding modest, and decently grave in her whole Behaviour; Not <note place="margin">Her modesty.</note> from any dulness of Constitution, nor affection of <hi>morose</hi> and reserved Virtue: But from a just apprehension, how unagreeable to an exact strictness of Life (which she had designed for her self) and how unconducing to the Reputation of her Sex, a too <hi>Sanguin</hi> Deportment is often found: Yet that she was not <hi>Cynically</hi> averse to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and convenient degree of Affability and Courtesie (a Virtue which was also very <note place="margin">Affability.</note> conspicuous in her) appeared, in that she used to receive the Visits of the meanest of her Neighbours with very great kindness, and would converse with them with a great deal of becoming condescention: And as any of them appeared to her to savour more of Godliness, she would (upon occasion) add a decent Proportion of Familiarity: For she studiously declined to admit any into her Bosom, but such as by exact observation she found to answer that Character of worth, by which she first valued herself, and then chose her intimate Friends; namely, <hi>not Greatness but Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This her Courtesie she extended to all sorts of Persons, even to such whom we <note place="margin">Courtesie.</note> look down upon with a supercilious Countenance, to wit, whose necessities made them Petitioners to her Bounty: For even such she entertained with great affability: So that what was once said of <hi>Titus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, might be truly said of her, <hi>That no Person departed out of her Presence discontented:</hi> Yea, even to those to whom she denyed her Alms (and some Persons are not meet Objects for a discreet Charity) she would so handsomely reprove for not using their bodily Abilities to get more honest and <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> more creditable Bread, that they seemed to go away no less satisfied with her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and seasonable Counsel, than they would have been with her Alms.</p>
               <p>Her inviting Countenance did so embolden the Poor to implore her help and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage; <note place="margin">Charity.</note> her compassionate Heart rendered her so sensible of their Conditions, and her Prudence so enabled her to manage their Causes, that as she was most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently imployed in many of their important Addresses to several of her Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on whom they depended, so she prosecuted their Suits in such a manner, that mostly she proved successful, meeting with such a Blessing from God upon her Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Endeavours, as the Justice of the Causes in which she engaged might warrant her to expect.</p>
               <p>Her very Servants had a share in the obligingness of her Conversation; For tho <note place="margin">Meekness.</note> she well knew her own Quality, and could keep them at a convenient distance, yet she attempered her carriage even to them, with so much mildness, that she was never observed to let fall a hasty or passionate expression to any of them, tho sometimes she was much provoked thereunto.</p>
               <p>She was of so innocent a Deportment, even from her Childhood, that one, of capacity enough to observe, and of Integrity enough to clear the Relation from the least suspicion <note place="margin">Innocency.</note>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:62667:226"/> of Flattery, gives her this Character; That <hi>during the space of ten years, wherein she lived in her Mothers Family, she could never observe any intemperate Word or Action; or any thing, which, if all the World had been acquainted with, would have in the least tended to her just diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or disparagement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She studied much how to gratifie the Tempers, and to content the Dispositions <note place="margin">Prudence.</note> and Propensions of those with whom she conversed in all lawful ways; insomuch that she hath been often observed to deny herself for to please others, according to the Rule of the Apostle St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 15. 2. And this quality rendered her, even in matters of Argument (which she wanted not Abilities to mannage to good purpose) not obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately tenacious of her own Opinions, but obligingly compliant to the Judgment <note place="margin">Humility.</note> of others, where Conscience of Duty required not the contrary: And this she did, that she might give offence to none, but be (as far as possible) profitable to all; which was the more observable, because Owners of great Parts commonly affect a <hi>Dictatorship</hi> in Discourse.</p>
               <p>These qualities rendred her of an excellent composure for a Friend, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly <note place="margin">Her Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> a rare Friend she was. She indeed did not rashly admit any to the Honour of her Bosom Acquaintance; but having once lodged any there, she was candidly free and open in communicating what her Judgment (which was always riper than her years) suggested to be most for the profit and advantage of their Souls concernments, whether Advice, Comfort, or Reproof: For which last, she always reserved a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, even towards her choicest and most intimate Friends, which yet she constantly managed with abundance of winning meekness and tenderness: And so severely conscientious was she in the discharge of this truly friendly Office, that having fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Occasions to receive Visits from, and to return them to Persons of her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that made the Reverend Names of <hi>Jesus</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> Interjections in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Discourse, that she made it a Case of Conscience, whether she did not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect her duty in not reproving them for it.</p>
               <p>And that she might not appear more rigid unto others in this kind than she was <note place="margin">Tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> to herself, her own Life was a <hi>Comment</hi> upon that Text, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>See therefore that ye walk circumspectly,</hi> &amp;c. For so exactly did she walk, that her care was to avoid not only what she condemned, but what she did but suspect in the Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others, insomuch, that her Conscience would not permit her to pardon herself what her Charity taught her to indulg in others.</p>
               <p>And indeed she was always of a tender and delicate Conscience, sensible of the least and smallest Sin, or but probable appearance of it; amongst which take these two Instances (of many others that might be given). That in her younger years, she addressed herself to her Governess with Tears, intreating her to forgive her, for that in her very Childhood she was Conscious that she had been defective in Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to her; for she thought that she did not then love her. A fault (surely) which others are far more guilty of, and yet are less troubled for it. Another time, in her more mature Age, when she had mildly enough, threatned a Child, over whom she had some inspection committed to her, that if she did not such a thing she would not love her, she presently recalled that, as too hard a word, saying, <hi>Alas! God deals not so with us, notwithstanding our continual Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Friendship.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As a Friend, she observed, that exchange of Kindness is the Fewel that feeds the Flame of mutual Affections, and keeps it from burning dimly, or going out, and therefore that it was a Nourisher of Ingratitude: And she accounted it the greatest <hi>Solecism</hi> in Friendship to be suspicious in receiving, or parsimonious in returning Kindnesses; and therefore what of this Nature she received, she would not (tho sometimes possibly there were probable grounds so to do) interpret it amiss; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that she abhorred the suspicion of a Design in Kindness, as the very bane of <hi>Gratitude:</hi> And in her returns she was always nobly obliging, as studying rather to stand in her Friends Book a <hi>Creditor</hi> than a <hi>Debtor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We heard something before of her Devotion as an early Blossom: But it had not the <note place="margin">Her growth in Grace.</note> Fate that usually befalls such <hi>Precosious</hi> Flowers, to be blasted and fall of before it come to maturity; For as she grew in Years, she grew also in Grace, and in Acquaintance and Communion with God, and kept a constant correspondence and intelligence with the Court of Heaven; which Heavenly Trade she followed so close, that her Lady-Mother, whilst she was under her Government, observing how she laboured at
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62667:227"/> it more than the constitution of her Body could well bear; and being afraid, lest by overstraining the Bow to reach the Mark she aimed at, she might be in danger of breaking it, once in a friendly manner told her, <hi>That if she intended to hold on that course, she was not fit to live in this World.</hi> To which this humble Lady (probably reflecting upon herself that term of unfitness to live, in another Notion than it was meant) answered with much meekness, <hi>No indeed, Madam, I confess, I am not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When she was married, she abated not of her Devotion, and thereby rendred her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">Her great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetion.</note> a singular instance of exception, to the difference which the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts betwen a <hi>Wife</hi> and a <hi>Virgin</hi> (and which the <hi>Romanists</hi> make so much use of to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a <hi>Vowed Virginity,</hi> which invention of theirs they prefer before marriage, an Institution of God) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 34. We may better judge of her Devotions by the proportion of time which she assigned for them every day; and her constant retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for that purpose were answerable to <hi>Daniels</hi> thrice a day <hi>(Dan.</hi> 6. 10.) And since the Decease of her precious Sister in Law (Dr. <hi>Langhams</hi> Wife) who dyed some Weeks before her (as if hereby she had taken the Alarm to prepare for her own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution shortly to follow) she more than doubled that proportion, even to <hi>David's seven times a Day,</hi> Psal. 119. 164.</p>
               <p>In her Devotions she busied herself, not only in secret Prayer and Meditation, but <note place="margin">Time impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> also in constant reading and studying of the Sacred Scriptures, which always took up a considerable part of her daily hours of retirement, together with her reading of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other of the Writings of some Learned, Practical Divines, with which Books her Closset was well furnished. She also made it part of her task to read over one Sermon a day, mostly out of her Note Books (for she constantly pen'd the Sermons which she heard) by which practice of hers (which she learned from the mention of the like in the life of the young Lord <hi>Harrington)</hi> and by frequent inculcation, she fixed in her Memory all that she heard, and had it in readiness for the direction of her Conversation, whensoever she had need to make use of it.</p>
               <p>Some, it may be, hearing how great a part of her time she spent thus in secret, may be desirous to know, what time she could allow for triming and adorning her Body: Or haply may suspect her to have been some strange deformed piece, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faln out with her Glass for telling too much <hi>Truth,</hi> had neglected all care of auxiliary handsomness as meer lost labour; and that she addicted herself to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of her Soul, out of despair of ever rendring her Body tollerably handsome, <note place="margin">Soul preferred to the Body.</note> much less beautiful. To satisfie therefore such as may entertain such thoughts, they may be informed, that her Person was such, as to a decent and middle Pitch, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a just proportion of all Parts, wanted not a Face, whose amiable Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, might, by the ordinary Artifices of that kind, have been advanced to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a <hi>Beauty,</hi> had she thought fit to have made use of them. Yet she neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected not to bestow upon it so much time and pains (after the necessary concerns of her Soul) as decency required, tho haply not so much as curiosity (had she studied it) would have called for. And this may satisfie such <hi>Questionists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this proportion of constant Devotion which she tasked herself for every Day, if we add her great care to fill up all the rest of her time in profitable Converse, we <note place="margin">Time precious.</note> cannot but look upon her as a great Example of that Command, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 16. For she did <hi>buy Time out</hi> (as the word signifies) of the Hands of those Wasters of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Minutes, which buy it all up, even from the most Religious imployments, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish it out in <hi>Pass-times</hi> and <hi>Recreations.</hi> Whence it was, that (tho she did not rigidly censure others) yet she never allowed herself to see any Masks, Interludes or Plays; or to play at Cards or the like Games; and that because she doubted whether the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of so much time, as commonly such Diversions do require, would be allowed upon her account or no. Much unlike to many great Persons, whose Time so lyes upon their Hands (as a dead Commodity) that they study always possible to put it off, because they know not▪ what profitable use to put it unto: A Prodigality, which how much cause they may have to repent of, they may come to understand, when, upon their Death-Beds, they find the want of those precious Hours and Minutes for more serious uses, which formerly they so lavishly wasted. The <hi>Heathen</hi> will rise up in Judgment against such, who purposed to allow a whole Day to no Converse that would not make him amends for the precious Time expended in it. <hi>(Sen. de Tranq.)</hi>

               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:62667:227"/>
               <p> But we left this excellent Lady pursuing her daily design of acquainting herself <note place="margin">Bible prized and studied.</note> with God in her set hours of Devotion; accounting it (as she said) a singular Mercy that the Great God of Heaven and Earth, would vouchsafe his Creatures such plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful discoveries of himself both in the Books of Nature and Providence: Yea, and beyond both those, in his <hi>written Word:</hi> and therefore she prized them all, but the last especially with an infinite Affection, insomuch, that she often rose early in the Morning to read and meditate therein: Nor would she, when she was engaged in that holy Work, suffer any interruptions how necessary soever, without evident signs of trouble and discomposure, till she returned to her <hi>Beloved Bible</hi> again: Yea, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the very Book it self, out of her love to the excellent matter contained therein, she expressed such a respect, that she resented, with a pious displeasure, any undecent usage of it, or careless throwing of it among other ordinary Books.</p>
               <p>She had an high esteem of every part of the <hi>Holy Bible,</hi> yet there was one part <note place="margin">Psalms delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</note> of it, namely the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> which she seemed to be most passionately affected withal (perhaps, because Similitude being the ground of Love, according to the Great <hi>Philosopher)</hi> she found such agreement betwixt her own Heart, and the Spirit of that Book. This her affection she shewed by reading, or causing to be read, one or more of them constantly at her hour of repose in the Evening, which by Meditation and Discourse, she used to improve, to her own benefit and theirs that were about her.</p>
               <p>And in her Bed she was wont to lock up her lips till morning with the repetition <note place="margin">Pious Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> of some one <hi>Psalm,</hi> that she had by heart, to which, having added some pious <hi>Ejaculations</hi> with wonderful fervency, she usually dropped a sleep in some holy <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie</hi> of devotion. And as she shut up her lips, and heart too in this manner at night, so she constantly opened them again in the morning with the same Golden Key: So that her sleep seemed to be but a <hi>Parenthesis</hi> betwixt her evening and morning devotions, which discontinued indeed, but did not disorder them; Yea, rather connexed, and united them into one intire piece, of which (probably) her very sleeping <hi>phantasie,</hi> by holy <hi>dreams</hi> made a part, seeing it was next to impossible, that even they, being hedged in between too such immediate acts of devotion, should not receive a proportionable tincture from the same.</p>
               <p>These her set devotions (probably) she methodized usually according to her own discretion; Yet did she not so tie up her self to her own designed order, as not to leave to herself a latitude, upon any extraordinary occasions, to vary as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. This appeared in that upon the solemn <hi>Great Festivals,</hi> at least so observed in our Church, she would accommodate them to those seasons respectively.</p>
               <p>In the course of her life she was precisely careful to avoid all manner of sin; And very <note place="margin">Sin avoided.</note> solicitous in all <hi>Emergencies,</hi> that were of consequence, to understand what her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was, that so she might practise it according. For as she made Gods <hi>Testimonies her delight;</hi> so did she make them her <hi>Counsellors,</hi> as (Psal. 119. 24.) insomuch that she never determined any doubtful occurrence without great deliberation, and the best advice she could procure. But especially after her marriage, she made frequent use given by the Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. When she desired to <hi>learn any thing, to ask her husband.</hi> And indeed, herein was she singularly happy, in being by Gods good providence directed to such an husband, as abundantly answered that <hi>character</hi> given by another Apostle, <hi>dwelling and conversing with her as a man of knowledg,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. One who was very able, and no less propense to entertain such kind of converse, especially with so near a relation as the wife of his bosom. And herein indeed, (besides the advantage which, by this means, she reaped to herself) she highly gratified him, by supplying him with opportunities of an imployment, which was so sutable to his own <hi>Genius</hi> and disposition: And withal, she herein practised the advise given her at her marriage by her prudent Lady Mother, <hi>to make herself fit conversation for her husband;</hi> Whereof this is a notable instance; That if at any time in her sollitary discourse with her husband (with which kind of converse she was much delighted) there had happened acessation on both hands for a little while, she <note place="margin">Time impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> would be presently apprehensive of the loss, and would desire him not to let her time pass unimproved; But either to renew the conference; Or to read some good book to her. <note place="margin">Talents impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note>

               <p>An Instance whereof of special remark, was this, that when she met with any <note place="margin">Her Prudence.</note> Divines of Note, at her Father in Law's [Sir <hi>John Langham's]</hi> Table, with whom, from the time of her Marriage till her Death, she continued (and that plentiful Table was seldom without Divines of Note) she would request her Husband to set on foot some profitable Discourse, which might minister to the Company advantage of their presence and converse, professing that she judged it altogether absurd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous to Reason as well as Religion, that <hi>Physitians</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> should be so ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily entertained, with discourses proper to their respective Functions; and that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> only should be treated with things out of the Verge of their Profession; indeed with matters altogether <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> and <hi>Excentrical</hi> to the Sphear of their Holy <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such as we have heard was her Devotion towards God; and she had learned as well her Duty towards her Neighbours, which she made to appear in every Relation and Capacity.</p>
               <p>When by her Marriage she was to be transplanted into her Husbands Family, her Lady-Mother failed not to give her such Instructions, which, as <hi>Maxims</hi> of Duty, she constantly practized in a just proportion to all her Relations. For;</p>
               <p>The first place in her Affections she gave to her Husband, whom she so intirely loved, that she hath been heard to profess that <hi>she could even die for him:</hi> And this <note place="margin">As a Wife.</note> her Love she expressed in an eminent Degree, by her dutiful compliance with whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she observed to be acceptable unto him: For she never received the least intimation of his pleasure (tho delivered in the terms of a <hi>request)</hi> but it found with her the force of a <hi>Command,</hi> with which (waving her own Opinion in Case of difference from his) she alwayes respectfully complyed; insomuch, that no instances of conjugal Happiness in others, ever minded him of any deficiency in his own, but rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a greater complacency in his so great felicity, whilst he found himself happy in his own Choice, even beyond the most eminent <hi>Examples.</hi>

               <p>And not only her Love and dutiful deportment, but her rare Learning also, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her to be a meet Help for him, as being thereby made capable of conversing with him in Points, both of <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Humanity,</hi> and that very knowingly and judiciously, and that in more <hi>Languages</hi> than one; for she was able to make use of learned Authors in other <hi>Tongues,</hi> not needing the help of <hi>Translations.</hi> As for <hi>Latin,</hi> that learnedest piece of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> [his <hi>Common Places]</hi> she frequently had recourse unto, and made good use of. For <hi>French,</hi> she was intimately acquainted with the Works of (That <hi>Prodigy of Learning and Language,</hi> Doctor <hi>du Moulin,</hi> out of whose <hi>Buckler of Faith,</hi> she was enabled not only to defend her own Protestant Faith and Religion, but (as she had any occasion to converse with any <hi>Popish</hi> Ladies) to batter and overthrow theirs. And for the <hi>Italian,</hi> she could make as good advantage of what Learning that <hi>Language</hi> afforded.</p>
               <p>And notwithstanding (which, in an accomplishment wherein she so much exceeded most of her Sex, insomuch that more it was remarkable) all these her rare and great parts, she was not at all elated or puffed up with them; that swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling conceitedness (which the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, doth too often <hi>Fly blow</hi> emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. and which is the very Bane of our Times) she was not tainted withal: So that her Husband was a perfect Stranger, and wholly unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all those inconveniences, which some have fancied, do necessarily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a <hi>Learned Wife;</hi> for even herein she would alwayes lower her Sails to him as to her Lord and Head; making use of her own Knowledg and Learning only to capacitate her to make the best improvement of His; from whom she would (as one, who, together with her other Learning had learned her Duty from the Apostle, to) receive Instruction in all <hi>submissive silence</hi> or <hi>quietness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To her Lady-Mother she did not forget her Duty in the least; no not when her <note place="margin">As a Daughter</note>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:62667:229"/> married condition had <hi>manumitted</hi> her from under her Government; but she still al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her the next place in her Affections to those of her Husband, and so demeaned herself towards her, that she always esteemed her, not only a very dutiful and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Daughter, but (as her own <hi>Phrase</hi> was) an <hi>excellent Friend</hi> also.</p>
               <p>To her Father in Law she payed the same Duty (according to the particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection given her by her Lady-Mother at the time of he Marriage) which she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to her own Mother, as considering, that where the Ordinance of God makes of two Persons <hi>one Flesh,</hi> it makes also a proportionable Union to their respective natural Relations on both sides; they being but <hi>Reliquiae Carnis nostrae,</hi> the remainder of every ones own Flesh in other Bodies: As both <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> and our own <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> from him, render those words, by which <hi>neerness of Kin</hi> is expressed, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 5.</p>
               <p>To the Memory of her Predecessor in that Relation wherein she stood to Sir <hi>James Langham,</hi> she testified (contrary to what is usual in such Cases) a very singular and signal Respect; enquiring with some eagerness, after her special Virtues, which she designed for her own imitation, and by giving the Good which she heard of her a just Commendation.</p>
               <p>To the Children which Sir <hi>James</hi> had by his first Lady (Providence having denyed <note place="margin">As a Mother.</note> him any by this, except one in expectation, to whom the Death of the Mother ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Womb a Grave) she was in her great care and tenderness so much more than a Mother in Law, that it was wholly impossible for any but those which knew otherwise, not to have mistaken her for their natural Mother; and if with them she had had any of her own Body, surely she could hardly have told how to have tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her love to her natural Issue (in any considerable <hi>indication)</hi> more <hi>Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> So solicitously did she interest herself both in the Education of, and Provision for them; and so concerned herself in all occasions of never so little bodily Distemper, that she deserved thereby to have rendered the Name of a Step-Mother a Name of Honour, and herself an <hi>Example,</hi> from whom even natural Mothers themselves might not disdain to learn a Law of kindness towards the Children of their own Bodies.</p>
               <p>From the Daughter, who was then about eleven years old, she constantly requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a repetition (by heart) of the Sermons, which she heard: And for this Task she had by her instructions so Logically methodized the memory of this young Child, that she was able to <hi>Analize</hi> a Sermon containing thirty or forty perticular Heads, with the most remarkable inlargments upon them.</p>
               <p>And this Religious care of her Children she not only continued during her health, but even in the time of her sickness also, so far as her weakness would permit. And to shew that she minded them as long as she minded any thing in this world, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Dying-Bed, she requested her Husband (tho he needed not any such Spur to quicken him in his Duty) to breed them up in the Exercises of severe Godliness; And to see them taught such Evidences of <hi>Salvation,</hi> as might support them one Day in their <hi>Dying Agonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To her <hi>Servants,</hi> she demeaned herself so mildly, as if they had not been so properly <note place="margin">As a Mistress.</note> Servants as <hi>Humiles amici</hi> (in the <hi>Moralists Phrase)</hi> a Sort of inferior Friends: which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment won her from them a great deal of awful Love, and <hi>Heart Service</hi> instead of <hi>Eye Service,</hi> which is the common vice of those in that Relation. She extended her care even to the meanest of them, and that, not only for their Bodies, but for their Souls also: Calling them, who were more immediately under her inspection (her Maidens) to an account in writing (if they could write) of the Sermons which they heard, and used to help and supply their wants out of her own more exact Notes. She would call upon them in the Morning to go to God, that is, to wait upon him in their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Devotions before they came to wait upon her: And if any one of them (for she would examine them severally) confessed, or by silence bewrayed a neglect thereof, she would immediately dismiss her from her present attendance upon her to go about that work, and that, not without some reprehension for giving her service the precedency to Gods. And this care she took (as she would frequently express her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to her husband) from a deep conviction of this truth, that <hi>Governors of families are to be accountable unto God for the souls of the meanest under their inspection.</hi> A course which (so far as she could bear it) she continued even in her last sickness. For when the importunities of her own bodily distemper kept any of them from the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62667:230"/> Church, to attend her necessities at home on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> she would tell them, that nothing, but an absolute necessity, should have been reason sufficient for her detaining them about her: But yet (said she) <hi>your minds are at liberty: let God have as much worship as you can give him, lift up your hearts, lift your hearts: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is the Lords day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you have a rare example, very fit to be followed by others of her Sex, and Quality. Yea well it was, if those, which are far inferior to her in Birth and breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would learn so much Religion from her, as to consider that servants have souls as well as themselves, yea <hi>immortal souls,</hi> that require sometime of triming and dressing as well as their Ladies and Mistresses bodies: And that these persons will surely give but a bad account of their servants souls, whose tedious dressings spend the greatest part of every day (not excepting the Lords day it self) and will scarce allow their Maids a minutes retiredness to lift up a short prayer in secret, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to sanctifie their imployments in the day.</p>
               <p>Neither did she extend this care of her Servants, only whilst they continued with her, but enlarged it to such as went away from her: An excellent example whereof may be this: when a mean servant came to take her leave of her, she gave her (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with some other expressions of her kindness and charity) much good counsel; and intreated her husband to make some additions thereunto; but especially to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss her with a second <hi>largess</hi> of good <hi>advice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her <hi>charity</hi> to the poor was very eminent, not staying till they made known their wants, but even pressing out of them those complaints which their modesty would <note place="margin">Her Charity.</note> have suppressed, by her strict enquiry into their conditions, that so she might find out wherein she might be beneficial and helpful to them. And when she was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of any of their wants that exceeded an ordinary work of <hi>charity,</hi> she was ever solicitous how she might procure a proportionable relief for such parties so concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Neither did her <hi>charity</hi> extend only to the bodies of those whom she releived: for she gave to most, especially to those, whose great Exigencies (in probability) rendred them more careful and inclinable to follow it, a double <hi>alms,</hi> both of her <hi>bounty,</hi> and Christian <hi>counsel</hi> also; which last (tho the other was not mean) was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly the best of the too.</p>
               <p>But a thousand instances of her great and frequent <hi>Charity,</hi> have escaped the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of any, but of those that received it, (she being in acts of this nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the notice of God and her own Conscience:) so that our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Rule in this, was hers: <hi>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth (Mat.</hi> 6. 3.) And yet, to Gods Glory and her own deserved commendation and Honour, those good deeds of this nature (which she studiously concealed in her life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, to avoid <hi>vain glory,</hi> which she alwayes abhorred) came to light in a great <note place="margin">Her Humility.</note> measure after her death, as appeared in the passionate resentments of those great crowds of poor People, who came thronging to have a sight of her <hi>Hearse</hi> whilst it was exposed to view, and shewed that it was not so much curiosity as affection that brought them thither, which they declared by their bitter <hi>Lamentations</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> wherewith they bewailed her Death (as the Widows did <hi>Dorcas</hi>'s, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 39.) as their common and irreparable loss.</p>
               <p>In the exercise of this her <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi> out of her great Fear (as we heard) <note place="margin">Her Prudence.</note> lest she should be too well thought of, if others knew the proportion of it, and that she might be the more assured of it, that it was not diverted from the right Channel, she commonnly trusted no Hands with it but her own; making it her care before she went abroad at any time, to furnish her <hi>Poor-mans Purse</hi> with such Monies as were fit to be distributed and divided, amongst such necessitous People, which Providence, before her return might cast into her way.</p>
               <p>One remarkable passage must not be omitted under this Head of her <hi>Charity,</hi> tho it only so far concerns her as to shew her Judgment in the choice of fit Subjects to lay it forth upon, and it was this; She was once told of the prodigious Bounty of some of her Ancestors towards <hi>Religious Places</hi> and <hi>Persons;</hi> as also for the training up of young Studients in the <hi>Ʋniversities:</hi> As soon as this last sort of their Charity was mentioned, she applauded this especially, thus expressing her thoughts of it; <hi>Indeed</hi> (said she) <hi>it is the best Charity to promote the Good of Souls; and in that respect it is a much nobler Bounty to be the means of consecrating the Life of one,</hi> than relieving the Age and Infirmities of twenty.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:62667:230"/>
               <p> She always professed a great detestation to <hi>Tale-bearing,</hi> which is the bane of Love and Charity, from which she had a high degree of abhorrency. She always suspected <note place="margin">Tale-bearers hated.</note> a <hi>Passionate Accuser,</hi> as being commonly more faulty than the Party accused; it being the usual <hi>Artifice</hi> of Malice, to endeavour the concealing of its own guilt by stopping the Ears of Justice with a prejudicate Opinion against those from whom it fears a <hi>Recrimination:</hi> And in all differences of this nature which came under her <hi>Cognizinee,</hi> she constantly used this healing Method; first to allay the <hi>acrimony</hi> of the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Spirits, and then to accommodate the difference it self.</p>
               <p>Indeed her Charity in all points, did answer the Character which the great Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of that heavenly Grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. which to read, is to comprise the whole History of her Life in an <hi>Abstract</hi> or short <hi>Epitome.</hi> Read it, and accommodate the several parts of it to the former Relation: <hi>Charity</hi> (and such was hers) <hi>suffereth long, and is kind, envieth not, vaunteth not it self, is not puffed up, doth not behave it self unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not in Iniquity but rejoyceth in the Truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things,</hi> verse 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>And truly to so eminent a progress in all manner of perfections, there could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be made any accession in this World; so that it was high time for her to be transplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from hence to the Society of the <hi>Spirits made perfect</hi> in the other World. And God (whose manner it is to gather his <hi>Fruit</hi> when it is fully <hi>Ripe)</hi> having now made her <hi>meet to be a pertaker of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</hi> accordingly thought fit to translate her thither, <hi>March 28th. Anno Christi</hi> 1664.</p>
               <p>Her Sickness of which she dyed, surprized her on a sudden, being the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her sickness.</note> disguised under the reliques of a <hi>Feaver,</hi> which to appearance was almost dispelled: And truly such a surprize of Death, in the very borders and confines of expected Health, might well have discomposed and put out of frame any Soul, but such an one as hers, which always kept so good a Guard, that no event could befall her for which she was not well prepared.</p>
               <p>During the Twilight of Hopes and Fears, which sometimes held both her <hi>Physitians</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> in suspence concerning her, she always seemed in her own inclination to desire St. <hi>Pauls</hi> choice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. To have a <hi>desire to depart and to be with Christ,</hi> Begging of her Dear Husband, who was (as he had great cause) humbly importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <note place="margin">Her deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein.</note> with God that he might have a longer enjoyment of her, that he would not pray for her Life but for her Soul, that God would make her fit to die; or if he pleased to gratifie the desires of those who so affectionately desired her Recovery, that he would so sanctifie his Hand unto her, that she might obtain Grace of him to pay her <hi>Vows.</hi> For truly her great aim and design was, to be <hi>perfecting Holiness in the Fear of God:</hi> And the great request, which she made for herself in the midst of her <hi>Feverish Paroxism,</hi> was, that by the burning heat (as she said) she might be purified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined: and conformable hereunto was that request of hers (taken notice of in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sickness which fell out a little before her Marriage) which she expressed with most <hi>Emphatical</hi> vehemency; <hi>O that I could do the whole Will of God!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In other times of this her last sickness, when her Husband praying by her, prosecuted with earnestness his constant request for her recovery to Health, and a longer Life; when the Duty was over, she would kindly chide the <hi>exuberancy</hi> of his affections, and desire him to rest content in Gods Promise, <hi>That all things should work together for his good, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. and to submit (as she wholly did) to his Sovereign Will, telling him withal, that he had no reason to let lose the Reins to Sorrow, if he saw her dye with good evidences of her going to Heaven; and to allay his passions in his greatest fears of that separation, which he so much deprecated; <hi>We came not</hi> (said she) <hi>into the World together, nor can we expect to go out of it together; yet is it a great satisfaction to me that I am going thither, whither, after a while, you shall follow me.</hi> And she was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what inquisitive (probably in order to the advancement of that satisfaction) what degrees of Communion the glorified Saints have one with another, and what measure of Knowledge they have of each other? A Question which is often asked by graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls, but surely impossible to be fully answered from clear Grounds of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Arguments on both sides being alike probable; neither need it create any trouble unto us, tho we still remain in the dark about it; 'tis but a little while before comfortable experience will decide the controversie to all that wait for the coming of the Lord Jesus, beyond all our uncertain Disputes; yet this we may conclude of,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62667:231"/> that if it will add any thing to our comfort and happiness, it shall not be wanting in that place where is <hi>fullness of joy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>During the whole time of her sickness, she was very solicitous of her deportment <note place="margin">Her Patience.</note> and carriage, under the afflicting hand of God, and afraid lest the restlesness oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by her Disease might be the fruit of Impatience; for which reason she would oftentimes (with a holy jealousie of herself) ask those about her, whether she did not seem to them to be deficient in Patience? And would seem to be troubled at the remembrance of the carriage of such Christian Friends, with whom she had been on their sick-beds, as conscious to herself how far short she came of them.</p>
               <p>Some conflicts with Temptations (if they may be so called, and not rather the <note place="margin">Her Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> tenderness of her own Conscience apt to smite her (as <hi>Davids</hi> did, for cutting off but the Skirt of <hi>Sauls</hi> Robe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5.) for the smallest omissions, of which yet, those that knew the strictness of her walking with God, thought she had little cause to complain) and yet those very complaints in the nature of them, argued a very great prosiciency in Holiness. Take one Example whereby you may judge of the rest: She bewailed that she had not been so sensible as she ought to have been, of the State and Condition of the Church of <hi>Christ.</hi> A thing which (I fear) most of us may more justly charge upon our selves, considering the woful havock at this day made in it by the <hi>Eastern Wild Boar</hi> out of the Forrest, and by the <hi>Foxes,</hi> the <hi>Romish Emissaries</hi> in several disguises, which seek to spoil its tender Grapes: Surely we do not as we ought, <hi>prefer</hi> Jerusalem <hi>before our chiefest Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it pleased God that these thin and light Clouds were soor dispell'd and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, the light of Gods Countenance breaking through them and filling her Soul <note place="margin">Her Comfort.</note> with comfort; so that she told a Friend that visited her, that she thanked God, that instead of a World full of troubles and miseries, God now had given unto her the sight of a better Country, and the Prospect hereof, together with the clearing of her title to, and interest in it (a thing which in her best health she expressed a great deal of solicitousness for, insomuch as she hath sometimes said, with an <hi>Emphasis</hi> of zealous earnestness, <hi>who is there than being once assured of the Pardon of Sin, would not be willing to dye the next hour?)</hi> made her now she had attained it, so willing and ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign up her Soul into the Hands of God her heavenly Father, as knowing whom she had trusted; and to lay down her Earthly Tabernacle in exchange for that <hi>House not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus fell what was Mortal of this precious and incomparable Saint, to her own infinite gain, but to the inexpressible loss of all her surviving Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, but especially of her near and dear Relations. And indeed it was her counsel to her tenderly loving and affectionate Husband in the time of her health, to <hi>take heed of overloving her,</hi> wishing him to be ware of it, as he desired not to be rid of her; for (said she) <hi>God will endure no Rival.</hi>

                  <hi>The</hi> Life <hi>and</hi> Death <hi>of the Right Honourable</hi> Susanna <hi>Countess of</hi> Suffolk, <hi>who Died,</hi> May <hi>the</hi> 19th, 1649.</head>
               <p>THis most Excellent <hi>Lady</hi> was Born in or about the Year 1627. She was the Second <hi>Daughter</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Holland:</hi> And came into the World by Accident, Six Weeks, as they accounted it, before her time; <hi>Nature,</hi> if we may so say, or rather <hi>Providence,</hi> being importunate to bring her forth, because she would be so admirably <hi>useful,</hi> and had but so short a time to continue here below.</p>
               <p>How happily and zealously she Improved her short Time and Life, I will, with all sincerity, endeavor to shew.</p>
               <p>And now, where shall I begin? and how shall I make an end? both seem alike difficult to my preparations; whereon shall I lay the Foundation to Build a <hi>Precious Name</hi> and <hi>Memorial</hi> for her, who her self had Purchased it so many ways? shall I tell you of her Natural Parts and Indowments? shall I tell you how her Parents and her self had perfected those by careful Education, Art and Industry? shall I let you know how those were made Graceful, by a meek, pleasant and affable Deportment? How they were adorned with the choisest Jewels, which every Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue could afford her, or which is rarest, that all these were Consecrated by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, even, frame and temper? and Lastly, which is the highest Perfection at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable on Earth, That she and they were Sanctified by the visible opperations of the Spirit of God, whose Image sat Bright and Glorious on her Soul, and did shine through all her Conversation? These are the solid sure Foundations of a <hi>Good Name,</hi> and all these Crouded so into my Thoughts at once, that they were easily lost in the many fair paths and turnings, through which (look which way soever you would) her Excellencies, Parts, Virtues, Graces, were ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and draw my Meditations.</p>
               <p>But that this Universality may not disorder your Thoughts, as they have done mine, I must not seek such Arguments for her Praise, being dead, (as have no fast bottom for an <hi>Inward Good Name,</hi> and) for which she would not only dispraise, but sharply censure me, if she were living. Namely, for any thing she had by Nature; although from that too in this regard, seeing whatsoever Nature had given her, she made a Vessel to lay up some Grace or other in.</p>
               <p>If I should tell you of the Sharpness of her <hi>Wit,</hi> I could not better instance to <note place="margin">Her <hi>Wit.</hi>
                  </note> prove it, than that in Questions of Religion, chiefly Cases of Conscience, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult places of Scriptures, she was most sudden at making Nice Doubts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary happy in resolving them, at least to the satisfying of others, although such was her Humility, and low esteem of her own Gifts, that she would earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly labour for the resolution of others, rather than trust to her own.</p>
               <p>Her <hi>Judgment</hi> was most <hi>sound,</hi> as did appear, as by her concurrence with the <note place="margin">Her <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> in Opinions about Secular Affairs, private or publick, so chiefly in the Controversies in Religion; that amids all those <hi>differences</hi> and <hi>varieties</hi> of Opinions, (to the Knowledg of which she was drawn by her curious Soul, which had a mighty Thirst after all kind of Knowledg, especially in matters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>God, Religion,</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> I say, though she knew all, <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> yet) she had a <hi>Discerning Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Exercised Senses</hi> to <hi>chuse</hi> the <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>refuse</hi> the <hi>Evil;</hi> not only in Points simply necessary to <hi>Salvation,</hi> in which we may believe the Spirit of God would not let her fall, but in Speculative Truths her Opinions were not tainted, nor her Mind shaken, with any of those plausible Errors, wherewith the Times did then so miserably infest and distract the Church of God, and <hi>led Captive</hi> many well-meaning Souls; but her knowing and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded assent went along first with the <hi>Sure Rule,</hi> the <hi>Writen Word of God,</hi> then with those, who for sticking to that, have been held the <hi>Soundest</hi> and most <hi>Classical;</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:62667:233"/> VVheresoever, in cases, she differd from the most received opinions, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in Practical points, and seldom but she inclined to the more strict, her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Error (if it were one) deserving its own pardon.</p>
               <p>Her <hi>Phancy</hi> was most Divine, and although she sed it very much with <hi>Humane</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her <hi>Phancy.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Authors,</hi> delighting in VVit, that was Pure, and filled with ingenious and artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conceit, Poetry especially, in the apprehension of which she was very <hi>Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous,</hi> and would ever set a Mark upon such expressions as were most emphatical and quaint, many times adding a Grace by her particular interpretation, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the intention of the <hi>Author,</hi> but with exceeding fitness and significancy; yet she most confined her Phancy to <hi>Gather Flowers</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> in <hi>Gods Garden,</hi> in his <hi>Book,</hi> and in such as exercised their VVits in that <hi>Field,</hi> especially in <hi>Divine Poetry,</hi> in which kind she took an excessive delight to be conversant in Mr. <hi>Herberts Temple,</hi> in which she found out such fit and significant Elegancies, that when she read or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated them, it was hard to determin whether the Author or she made the sence, such innumberable Descants would she make upon every single expression there; And to shew what delight she took in that heavenly VVit, I have heard her more than once, seriously aver, that if there were no more extant but her Copy, some hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reds of pounds should not purchase that <hi>little Book</hi> from her; and if it had come to the offer, I am well assured no money (of which she was no admirer at all; of <hi>Wit, Devout Sanctified Wit</hi> especially, very much) could have gain'd it from her.</p>
               <p>Her <hi>Memory</hi> excelled not her other Parts, and yet was even to admiration <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her <hi>Memory.</hi>
                  </note> of which the proofs were not so many in secular affairs, because her exercises in them were but of discretion, Necessity, and to please Others; Her joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light were in such things as adorned her Soul, and in such her <hi>Memory</hi> was the most <hi>Faithful Servant</hi> that could be imagined; she did not make it her I ask to get things without Book, but what she liked, her <hi>Memory,</hi> like a good Steward, would carefully lay up, even without bidding; Begin a Religious <hi>Ode</hi> of Mr. <hi>Herberts,</hi> which she had read, and she would ordinarily repeat the rest without sticking or missing; nay scarce could you begin any verse in the Bible to which she would not persently add the latter end, as to the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and some other places, I have been an Ear-witness at the tryals, and this only by the willingness of her <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> not any tasking of it; These she had at her Heart, therefore might say them by Heart, she had them rooted in her Heart and Affections, and therefore might more easily rebearse them, they lay uppermost, and therefore were ready at all occasions. Out of the abundance of the <hi>Heart</hi> the <hi>Mouth</hi> speaketh.</p>
               <p>I must not forget to give one pregnant instance of her <hi>Memory,</hi> when imployed about these better things, she hath sometimes the day after the Lords Day, locked up her self in private, and from her <hi>Memory</hi> committed to writing a Sermon, which she had heard the Day before, so perfectly that little was wanting in the very words wherein it was delivered. Several were Eye-Witnesses of one Sermon which she thus took from the mouth of a Grave Prelat; This she had propounded to her self to do constantly, and with great alacrity pleased her self in the thoughts of it, but necessary occasions on the day following, for the most part robbing her of her much-desired privacy, she was with great grief (and I have heard her complain) compelled to lay that practice aside, until God should give her more fixed oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.</p>
               <p>When I think what Nature made her, I cannot also but remember that Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored her, even her Body, to be <hi>a living Temple of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and these Three choyce Ornaments of hers, her <hi>Memory, Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Phancy,</hi> may find some fit resemblance with those Three peculiar Treasures, which were laid up the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> of God; namely the <hi>Pot of Manna,</hi> the <hi>Tables</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Aarons Rod</hi> that <hi>Budded: Her Judgment</hi> was as the <hi>Pot of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> in which she could find all wholsome soul-feeding Doctrines; her <hi>Memory</hi> as the <hi>Tables</hi> of the <hi>Covenant, Gods Law being her meditation Day and Night;</hi> her <hi>Phancy</hi> as <hi>Aarons Rod</hi> that Budded fresh, Buds of refined Wit and invention, always sprout-from it.</p>
               <p>Besides these she had a most Methodical Head, to dispose of all her affairs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, Domestick, Civil, Religious, into the clearest order that might be; And to this natural Aptness to any Art, or any Imployment, even to Tongues and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62667:233"/> Musick, Needle-work, Cutting, Drawing, and whatsoever was useful, or harmlesly delightful.</p>
               <p>As these <hi>Natural endowments</hi> might procure her a <hi>Good Name</hi> with those, who look no higher, than meer Nature, so if I should touch at those Vertues, which gain reputation for Morality, I might advance her esteem in this Sphere, as one, who was the most absolute Governess over her own Passions, that these times could instance in; she was seldom angry, so far as to chiding, and if it came to that, she commonly checkt her self, and if she observed any did mark her, it should end in laughing at her own Passion; it being often told her, that she knew to do any thing more skilfully, than to chide, especially if it were for any worldly matter; But if it were for any thing that concern'd the Cause of God, she would be more serious in it; and often turn her Anger into a zealous reprehension and displeasure; An Oath in her hearing, or if by Chance some scurrilous, light, or prophane Speech should slip from any, it Would make her blood to rise in her Face, if she had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in the offenders, they were sure to be reproved, and on many, to reduce them from their rash inclinations in that kind, she would invent to impose some handsome Penalties; if they were strangers she would let fall some witty Check, consistent with civility, or by withdrawing her self signifie her dislike.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this, she had a Natural <hi>Comity, pleasantness</hi> of <hi>Behaviour,</hi> and <note place="margin">Her <hi>Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
                  </note> Civil <hi>Urbanity,</hi> by which seldom any who fell under her reproof could depart sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful out of her presence, except it were because they did depart, or for that by not setting a <hi>Watch</hi> to the <hi>Door</hi> of their <hi>Mouths</hi> they had given just offence to her tender <hi>Christian Ears.</hi> These Vertues I name, because where discretion puts them forth in Society, they are as <hi>Precious Balms</hi> to heal the wounds, which others sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful behaviour infflict on Company, or go uncured by that fullen absence of those, who are morose, and know not how to apply remedies in season and out of season, fit and suitable to the maladies.</p>
               <p>It were an endless labour to speak of her Behaviour, which for the most part was innocently cheerful, unaffected towards Superiours and Equals, undislembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards friends, familiar towards inferiours, affable and accessible to all, and in much conversation her Words were commonly Gracious, and seasoned with Salt; she was Constant in her Frindship, and none more useful, willing to take any pains, where she pretended that; unapt to hear ill of any, of whom she had once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived well; nothing was so great a disease to her, as an accusation of those, of whom she had a good opinion; her Servants fared not the worse for being Servers, to whose errours she could be as Indulgent, as to Friends, and never lookt on any Servant which she had, and believed Faithful and Vertuous, but as upon an humble Friend. This, and her diffusive kindness, which extended to all she knew miserable, did (I dare say) much increase the tears which fell for her Death, none understood Relations, none could possible observe them better than she, I appeal to Husband, Parents, Kindred, Friends, Servants, Neighbours, to witness this truth.</p>
               <p>I would not inlarge on these, which seem to be but Moral Vertues, if they had been indeed no more but meer Morality; but I am assured they flowed from a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious disposition in her; they were the streams from <hi>Jordan,</hi> the <hi>Laver</hi> of <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and we may well baptize them Christian Vertues in her; For it is well known, that all her actions, which deliberation did give birth unto, she did them out of a Conscience of duty, and as in the Sight of God.</p>
               <p>Hence was that <hi>Holy Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Boldness</hi> for <hi>Truth,</hi> for which she durst be <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her <hi>Holy For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi>
                  </note> she would suffer any inconvenience, rather than she would tell an <hi>Untruth,</hi> or make an Excuse, or let any of her Servants do it, or by any <hi>Equivocation</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or elude a question; For this have I known her much afflicted, when she had business, especially her Religious Task, how to shun company, and shun a Lie, that she might not be found out; but any Rock would she venture upon rather than an <hi>Untruth;</hi> and indeed it is to be doubted, that the not fearing to split against this hath made many make <hi>Shipwrack of Faith and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her <hi>Charity</hi> I need not speak of; the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Distressed,</hi> whom her pitiful heart <note place="margin">Her <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </note> had often relieved, did at her Death and long after Mourn over her loss, and much Praise her abundant goodness in releiving them; this she ever did without the least
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62667:234"/> Ostentation imaginable. Indeed she was made up of Christian kindness and Pity; and though I told you she was a Perfect Governess of her Passions, yet her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion</hi> always governed her; nor did I ever know her shut her hand, when any in want opened their Mouth for an <hi>Alms,</hi> she could not excuse her self by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times having no Money about her, if any of her Attendants had, they were sure to be Almoners.</p>
               <p>But her High-way <hi>Charity</hi> was not the Tithe of what she gave, they need not come to her to ask, but <hi>Clothing,</hi> and <hi>Food,</hi> and <hi>Physick,</hi> and other <hi>Comforts,</hi> were sent to their Habitations, that had any, nay, and these provided also for some, who must otherwise have lyen without Doors, and her self a frequent <hi>Visitour</hi> to be truly informed of their Persons, and Condition.</p>
               <p>But what do I speak of her <hi>Charity</hi> to the Bodies of the <hi>Poor?</hi> she had a <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>relieving</hi> the <hi>Souls</hi> of all by her Daily <hi>Alms</hi> of <hi>Prayers</hi> offered up; by her <hi>Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> where she found the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> by her <hi>Counsels</hi> to the <hi>Doubting</hi> and <hi>Scrupulous?</hi> How hath she been moved to see some <hi>Wretches</hi> by distraction deprived of their Reason? how she would inquire after the known and secret causes of such Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and cast about to have some <hi>Cure</hi> if possible? I am sure she hath spoke and wrote, and travell'd, for one, well known in her time, whom it pleased God to let fall into that to be lamented Condition.</p>
               <p>But still she had more kinds of <hi>Charity</hi> than I have named, one was in forgiving <hi>Injuries,</hi> which might be by mistakes perchance, but if wilfully or maliciously cast upon her, it was the same thing, indeed the same <hi>Nothing</hi> in her account or <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> I told you of her <hi>Memory,</hi> how <hi>Tenacious</hi> it was; but truly if it were to lay up an <hi>ill-Turn,</hi> it had no hold at all; <hi>Benifits</hi> and <hi>Good-Turns, Good-Deeds,</hi> and <hi>Good-Sayings,</hi> were Ingraven in her Heart, as if written in <hi>Adamant,</hi> never to be blotted out, <hi>Offences</hi> and <hi>Injuries</hi> never came near it, her <hi>Memory</hi> was <hi>Water</hi> to them, even the Water of <hi>Lethe,</hi> which makes them that drink of it forget all things, all things of that nature I am sure was soon forgot by her; An <hi>Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> indeed, for the time might make a deep impression, a great wound in her Heart, where all things were so contrary to it, so made up of <hi>Kindness, Pity,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> but it could never beget the like <hi>unkindness</hi> there.</p>
               <p>I could now speak of the lively Sings of her <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> by which her Soul <note place="margin">Her <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope.</hi>
                  </note> mounted even into the Bosom of Christ, above all fears and griefs, which these Times brought thick upon her; Fear indeed, if it came suddenly, would a little surprize her, an incidency to that Sex, and the tenderness of her nature, but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon would she recollect her self, and by Reason and Religious Arguments dispel all carnal Fears.</p>
               <p>So did her <hi>Grief</hi> yield to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and the <hi>Comforts</hi> which she could fetch readily out of Gods Storehouse, and pertinently for her present malady, and the cure of it. When her first-born Son, her then only Child, had the Pangs of Death upon him, she (after Prayers and Tears) sat very disconsolate, and when at the report of his departure, Floods of Tears would needs Flow from her Eyes, to stop these Flood-gates she took her Bible, and fell to singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> until she had broken the violent torrent of her Passion, and brought her Soul to a cheerful Submission to the Will of God.</p>
               <p>I have spoken of her natural <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Endowments,</hi> a little touch I have given of some of her <hi>Virtues</hi> and the <hi>Ornaments</hi> of her Mind. Those more outward of her body, as she undervalued them, so I pass them over: yet one thing let me <note place="margin">Her <hi>Humility.</hi>
                  </note> tell you of her <hi>Apparel,</hi> and indeed the chief, which she delighted in, and that which was seen above and over all the rest, was that Garment which the Apostle commends, <hi>Humility,</hi> she was clothed all over with that, the <hi>Ornaments</hi> of her <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> all shined through that, and the <hi>Veil</hi> of <hi>Modesty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for her Attire and Dressing, this I can aver, that her self had the least af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <note place="margin">Her <hi>Attire.</hi>
                  </note> for it, for her self, but only for those who were related to her, that she might not seem mean or unworthy their allyance or affections. This resolution she had taken up long since, and avowed to wear no other <hi>Garments</hi> but <hi>Black,</hi> so long as she should live, not only presaging what those Tragical Times might require, but as being the gravest and most suitable to her disposition. And to check all thoughts of Phancy or delighting in outward Ornaments, amongst some Places in her Bible, at which she set a <hi>Memento,</hi> and a Mark to be often read, there did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62667:234"/> her Death stick a Pin, which she fastned with her own Hands in the Margent, against that <hi>Place</hi> in the Third of the First of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where the <hi>Duty</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Wives to their <hi>Husbands</hi> is prescribed, but particularly it did point at the Third, Fourth, and Fifth verses, <hi>Whose adorning, let it not be the outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of putting on of Apparel, or of wearing of Gold, but let it be the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price;</hi> the place is worth the consideration of all, especially of that Sex.</p>
               <p>A rare mark of modest Gravity of one of her Place and Age, she being at her Death (which adds much to all that I have said or shall say) but just past the Two and Twentieth <hi>Year</hi> of her Age, not come to her full strength and flourishing, such a Blossom I think can scarce be paralleld.</p>
               <p>Having, as I said, spoken a little of her <hi>Endowments,</hi> and the habits of her <hi>Mind,</hi> spare me a little time to let you see that her Practice was according to those Habits, which she had not as <hi>Talents</hi> Buried in a Napkin, but with mighty diligence and vigour improved them to her Masters use, to Glorifie God the giver of those Gifts, to edifie and benefit those to whom she related, and to make her own Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Election sure.</p>
               <p>I shall speak but of those which were the constant Practice of her life, and such as may seem preparations for her Death, and I will be as brief as it is possible to be in such an Argument.</p>
               <p>She began the <hi>Day</hi> with God, and as she open'd it, so she shut up the Evening <note place="margin">Her <hi>great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</hi>
                  </note> with the same <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>Prayer.</hi> Most commonly as soon as she could break sleep from her Eyes (or because she would not take her fill of sleep, which she thought she loved too much, others must wake her) gliding into her Closet, and before she dressed her Body, (except some urgent occasion required it) she perfumed her Breath with Prayer, and then read her daily Task in the <hi>Bible,</hi> which was the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> usually observed for the day of the <hi>Month,</hi> and six Chapters, intending by that course to read the whole <hi>Bible</hi> over twice in the Year, which I am confident she did not fail of, for these last seven Years; for if necessity did compel her to omit once or twice, she doubled or tripled her number at the next opportunity.</p>
               <p>She ordered her <hi>Soul</hi> first, and then all other things were set in exactest Order, <note place="margin">Her <hi>Digesting her Time.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Books, time,</hi> &amp;c. she had digested her hours into methods for affairs, repasts, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Books of Humanity, Divinity, Devotion chiefly, as may appear both by the Books marked in the Margent, and noted with her own Hand, as also by her Papers and Memorials, when she began to read any Book. Besides reeding her Task in the <hi>Bible,</hi> which she did for the daily Bread and Food of her Soul, she for pious recreation and more exact knowledg, had set time apart to examine the hard places by <hi>Diodates</hi> Notes, and others, which she had by her, and because she could not stop her current of reading at that instant to stay and search every dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, she set a mark at them to be searched at her further leisure. She had marks of several kinds, some for difficulties, some for Memorials of choyce places, or pertinent to some peculiar purposes, but I know it was her resolution to have read the <hi>Bible</hi> together with Expositors in a daily Task, besides her number of six Chapters a day, and the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and besides that she noted such Places as she intended to confer with Divines or others about the meaning of.</p>
               <p>I shall not need to name the other Books, which fed her Devotion, indeed on some she desired to have a holy surfet, to name a few, were to injure her, none came in her way, which she would not tast, and if they relisht, feed on; When she began to read an <hi>Author,</hi> is sometimes to be found in her <hi>Calendar,</hi> and in those Books wherein she most delighted, how far she had read, and with what she was most affected, is to be seen by marks in the Margent.</p>
               <p>She had a Zeal for the observation of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and <hi>times</hi> set apart for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, <note place="margin">Her <hi>Zeal for the Lords Day.</hi>
                  </note> but especially before she received the <hi>Holy Communion</hi> (which she did strive to do very frequently, as finding much comfort by it) then she used all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act <hi>strictness</hi> and serious <hi>Preparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She sometimes her self would <hi>Repeat</hi> with some of her <hi>Family,</hi> what she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred of the <hi>Sermons;</hi> which she could also note in the Church, and used it for a time, until she either found it a little damped the devoutness of her
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62667:235"/> attention, or because she had a purpose so to order it, that she might afterwards have privacy and leisure to write down what her memory would retain (which how much it was I have told you before.)</p>
               <p>If I would pursue particulars, it were hard to find any shore in the wide Ocean of her Praises, and yet in describing her life, I need not fear flattery, for truly to set out only some part of her <hi>Worth,</hi> and to keep back the rest, or to draw her Picture with my rude Pencil, is far beneath the true and genuine Beauty which was in her large <hi>Soul,</hi> so there is no fear of exceeding.</p>
               <p>But if any should say, why nothing but praise? had she no Errours, no infirmities or sins? truly yes, she had, and, as if she had desired with the Apostle, only to <hi>Glory in her Infirmities;</hi> as if the World were not envious or not prying enough to find them out, she hath left a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of them upon record under her own hand, as hath been seen since her death amongst her Papers; as if she had rather wished this solemnity might have been spent in rehearsing them, than any of her Virtues: She had written down 46 Particulars, which she used to bewail as faults, or infermities, or wants. But her Sins and Infirmities, so often by her bewailed, and buried in the grave of Christ, I doubt not but your Christian Charity will think fit to be buried with her, or in a deeper Grave, the grave of Oblivion, whilst her <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> and <hi>Good Name</hi> due to them, shall live, and flourish, and find a perpetual Monument in every one of our Hearts. She was, as all Gods Children are, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under great <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>dejection of Spirit,</hi> and tryed by great <hi>Temptations,</hi> under which some few years ago she lay for a time, and it cost her many Tears, which God at the last regarded, and heard her Prayers, delivered her out of the snare, and set her on an high and sure Rock by <hi>Faith.</hi>

                  </gap> so I shall have done with that part of Practice, wherein the course of her Life was seen; I desire to add something of that, which might seem to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare her for, or at least to attend her at her <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed her whole Life was that, which sound Philosophers, or rather sound Christians would have it, <hi>A Constant Miditation,</hi> or <hi>Preparation</hi> for <hi>Death;</hi> She was <note place="margin">Her <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Death.</hi>
                  </note> never long unprepared for that; the assurance of which, how great a Comfort it has been to her surviving Friends, is not easily imaginable.</p>
               <p>For it pleased God to let the violence of her Disease seise upon her choycest and most exquisite part, her <hi>Intellectuals</hi> (although with some short and sweet returns) for Three or Four days before she dyed.</p>
               <p>Her Behaviour on her <hi>Death-Bed</hi> was the most sweet, and the most comfortable, and Christian, that ever I heard of, She was <hi>Twice</hi> thrown down upon the Bed of <note place="margin">Her <hi>Behaviour on Her Death-Bed.</hi>
                  </note> Death, she might say indeed she <hi>Dyed daily</hi> by renewed acts of mortification; But in a true and proper sence, before this <hi>expiring,</hi> she had totally resigned up her self, and expected every moment when the <hi>Angels</hi> should fetch her <hi>Soul</hi> from her body <hi>once before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The story is famously known to all that knew her, about Six Months ago (in <note place="margin">The cause of Her Death.</note> the Month of <hi>November</hi> last past) she having reckon'd her self to be with Child, and finding unusual Symptoms, such as in that case she never had experience of, she thought that God did now admonish her to set <hi>her House in order,</hi> and to set her <hi>Soul</hi> in order, for it was very probable, he might <hi>finish</hi> her days on Earth, at her bringing forth.</p>
               <p>The time past, which she expected should be the hour of Deliverance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it some weeks, which caused great doubting of her Condition, whether she had conceived at all, and sometimes Physitians and those about her conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Contrary, but no doubt did she make of being <hi>Prepared</hi> for <hi>Death,</hi> of which she often discoursed, and what thoughts she had of its <hi>Nearness;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she had bodily strength and went abroad, she took the opertunity of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Spiritual Strength</hi> to her <hi>Faith</hi> and other <hi>Graces,</hi> by pertaking of the <hi>Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;</hi> Six days or there abouts after that, (a Month after her time) she fell into the <hi>Pangs</hi> of Women in travel, and when the Midwife had spent all the day, and could give no help, but totally dispared, in the evening it was discovered, that it was no living Child, of which she labour'd, but of that, which in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all about her, must within a few hours (or days at most) make her a dead Woman.</p>
               <p>She soon apprehended their fears, and earnestly beg'd now (as she did at all
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62667:235"/> times) that she might be plainly dealt with concerning her condition for <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> which she would in no Case indure to be dissembled to her, or concealed from her; her friends did observe her Desire, and confessed their hopes of <hi>Life</hi> to be small or not any, but desired her to submit to Gods Will in her disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>How would you now imagine she received the <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Death?</hi> with <hi>Frights</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her <hi>receiving the Sentence of Death.</hi>

She sent for those, who most nearest related to her, and her <hi>Kindred</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> and composing her Countenance and gesture to the most Majestick and undejected Gravity that I ever beheld, She fell to taking leave, bequeathing, not her worldly <hi>Affairs,</hi> but spiritual <hi>Comforts,</hi> her <hi>fervent Prayers, Divine Blessings,</hi> her <hi>Weighty Counsells</hi> and <hi>Admonitions</hi> fitted particularly, and made proper to every one to whom she gave her <hi>Heavenly Legacies,</hi> especially to her <hi>Lord,</hi> her <hi>Children,</hi> her <hi>Allies,</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> and all were such as might tend to direct them in <hi>wayes</hi> of <hi>well-doing,</hi> by which they might through <hi>Christs merits,</hi> meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in <hi>Glory.</hi> But all this with such Affection, such <hi>Zeal,</hi> such <hi>Courage,</hi> such <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> of her going now from Pain and Misery to Joyes unspeakable, that the <hi>Image</hi> of that Day and her <hi>Aspect</hi> will never depart out of the Memory, of several who looked on. If you had seen Her on her then suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Death-bed, you would have thought of <hi>Moses</hi> on <hi>Pisgah,</hi> or <hi>Jacob</hi> on his Death-bed, dividing his blessings, of dying <hi>Joshua,</hi> or of <hi>David,</hi> or the best Composed Saints.</p>
               <p>To see her dearest Pledges and Relations, Friends and Servants standing by, flowing with Tears and Lamentations, and her self stedfast and unconcern'd, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selling; Comforting, Blessing them with her last breath (as she and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

               <p>After, she spent her time in declaring the <hi>Affiance</hi> she had on the Merits, and <note place="margin">Her <hi>Affiance in Christ.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Assurance</hi> she had on the Love of Christ; She did not conceal also how she had wrestled with <hi>Doubtings,</hi> and did propound the greatest Scruple, which lay upon her Conscience for the sincerity of her Repentance. She spake of the Comfort she had at her last ceceiving the Sacrament, she confest indeed, that she might have <hi>soyld</hi> her self after; but yet the last night she had also <hi>beg'd</hi> pardon (and I was told by those, that know it that she had then been a whole hour in private upon her knees, although at that time no danger of Death was feared) and further profess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that now nothing was a greater burthen than this, that although she was <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to <hi>Dye,</hi> yet she found also a <hi>willingness</hi> in her heart to <hi>Live,</hi> which she much <hi>blamed</hi> in her self. Although that might proceed from the consideration of the good of those she was to <hi>Leave,</hi> rather than that it was better for her <hi>to stay.</hi> And so it seemed good to our Heavenly Father, that she lived Six <hi>Months</hi> after her time might seem to have been expired; as <hi>Nature</hi> seem'd importunate to gain her into the World, (as was said in the beginning so she was as unwilling to let her depart out of it, to loose one of her choycest Children) It seemed good to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> even to let the <hi>Sun</hi> of her <hi>Life</hi> go back <hi>some few Degrees,</hi> after it seem'd to be in the very lowest point of Setting; his marvellous Providence pointing out such <hi>ways,</hi> and making all <hi>Circumstances</hi> so concur even beyond hope, (whereof if any one had failed, there could have been no possibility of recovery) that she seem'd rather by a <hi>Divine Miracle</hi> raised from the <hi>Dead,</hi> than hy any humane help or hand restored from danger.</p>
               <p>And indeed as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. <hi>Women received their dead raised to</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:62667:236"/>
                  <hi>life again;</hi> so did they then look upon this not as a <hi>Recovery,</hi> but as a <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And if you please, reckon her Death from that very hour, that she resign'd up her self to it so freely, and if we look upon her walking since, we may <hi>believe</hi> she was as one <hi>Dead</hi> to the World, as one that was Risen with Christ, and had her Conversation in Heaven intentionally, her affection, I am sure <hi>on things above not on things on Earth.</hi> Account her now as <hi>Dead,</hi> as one <hi>whose life was hid with Christ in God.</hi> For shall I speak plainly, she <hi>walked</hi> on Earth, but she <hi>lived</hi> not after this, as to her self, to others indeed she did, and to their especial Comfort.</p>
               <p>I have observed Two or Three things for which God in his Providence might bestow this little time, and lend her to her Friends on Earth; he might seem to spare her a little, and give her space for these Reasons. One was in mercy to her Father. Another to her <hi>Dear Relations</hi> at home. A Third was to finish some <hi>Work</hi> upon her own <hi>Soul,</hi> for the good Example of others, her own <hi>Work</hi> was done; however in all these I may say <hi>She lived not to her self</hi> as in the World.</p>
               <p>To her <hi>Father</hi> in his extream affliction God made her an unexpressible Comfort. I speak not in regard of any temporal things, which God had determined, as we saw, to cut away wholy from him, as to this life, and all the Comforts of it; which not withstanding to procure. <hi>What Pains, Travel, Watchings, Fastings,</hi> in that extreme cold season did she undergo, (even boyond what <note place="margin">Her <hi>Duty to her Father in the Time of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment.</hi>
                  </note> might be expected from her Sex, but especially one of the tenderest breeding in it) was very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable by all, and <hi>Satisfactory to him</hi> abundantly.</p>
               <p>But to shew that it was the service of his <hi>Soul</hi> that she aim'd at, as if her <hi>Soul</hi> had been held in life, for that purpose that she might be an Instrument to <hi>draw</hi> her <hi>Fathers</hi> with her to Eternity.</p>
               <p>Let me tell you but this. When all hopes of Life were past, and after She, with the rest of those <note place="margin">Her <hi>Love to his Soul.</hi>
                  </note> who were dear to him, had taken their final leave, that the rest of his hours might be spent with his spiritual Comfortors, She could not <hi>give sleep to her Eyes, nor Slumber to her eye Lids,</hi> untill she had once more visited and discoursed with him, but yet in matters relating wholy to Eternity. And therefore coming betimes in the Morning, first timorously into his Chamber (after she had watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all night in a room hard by for that purpose) when he had with joy discernd and welcom'd her, they presently fell into Conference; in which she, with an humble boldness, did so question and answer, rip up and stich together again, gently wound and then give balm to the State of his Soul; In a word she did so apply both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> to him, that being refreshed with these comforts, he cryed out, <hi>Happy I that I should from a Child of mine own receive such Consolation,</hi> And after that he told a Reverend Divine, who came to administer the like Consolation, <hi>That he thanked God he had a Child there, who, (though he said it before her face) was able to be his Counsellour in all his doubts.</hi> Also another Divine present, heard her half an hour to admiration as he professed.</p>
               <p>After her <hi>Fathers</hi> death none, so nearly relating, bore all with the like Christian patience as she, acknowledging it the wise <hi>Method</hi> of Almighty God thus to bestow <hi>Mercy</hi> on a <hi>Soul,</hi> which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Her <hi>bearing his Death.</hi>
                  </note> so great a measure of <hi>Affliction,</hi> in <hi>Health</hi> and in the <hi>Glory</hi> of his prosperity, could not, or would not ever have so humbly and sincerely sought it from the Bed of sickness, if death should have taken him from that Place.</p>
               <p>She likewise said that she could not (if it were possible and lawful) with her heart and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him alive again, although it were well known, that never Parent lay deeper in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a Child than he in hers. But she durst not wish him so bad a change, as to leave Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Earth, especially this earth as things now make it.</p>
               <p>To another she said, that now, if God would give her leave, she would go into the Country, and she had cast her <hi>Family-business</hi> into such a way, that for her self she would have nothing to do <note place="margin">Her <hi>setting her House in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
                  </note> but to be <hi>Ready</hi> to <hi>Dye.</hi> For, this let me note, there was not a night in Six Months since her last recovery from her mortal sickness, that she rose from off her knees from her prayers <hi>without Tears running down her Cheeks,</hi> as I am certainly informed by those who had reason to know it.</p>
               <p>And now she desired conference with one, whom in her <hi>Souls</hi> affairs she had trusted, from whose Hands she intended to receive that <hi>Holy Mystery,</hi> she discovered her spiritual codition to him plainly and Clearly; and Charged him to deal as severely and impartially with her, and still would urge him again and again, after this manner, <hi>O but you deal more gently with me, than you would with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I beseech you let me know the worst.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although her disease got into her Brain and bred some disturbance there, yet it pleased God to afford her many clear and bright Glimpses; One remarkable I shall mention wherein she poured forth her <hi>Soul</hi> in a large Prayer, the words of which cannot be recollected, but in effect, it was of such most fervent, melting, moving passages, as if she would out-wrestle God, and rend from him his <hi>mercies</hi> by unresistable violence, and take the Kingdom of <hi>Heaven by Force</hi> out of his hands, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as for laying before him his <hi>Name,</hi> his <hi>Attributes,</hi> his <hi>Bowels,</hi> his <hi>Christ,</hi> all his <hi>Cimfortable Promises,</hi> which she fetch't with most admirable skill, choyce, and Fluency from every precious <hi>Vein</hi> in the Rich Mind of his <hi>Word:</hi> This was the last continued Act of Reason, which she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; only, when her strength was even spent, she owned her Dear Relations, when they came unto her, and did let them understand, she was now marryed to Christ? joyn'd with most heedful attention in Prayer, with one, whom she then desired to do that office, gave signs of approbation, and requested that he which poured it out on her behalf would not go out of the room; after that, within little more than an hour, in a quiet kind of sleep, the Passages of Life being stopped, she yielded up her Spirit unto God that gave it, <hi>the</hi> 10th <hi>Day of</hi> May, 1649. leaving behind her the most <note place="margin">Her <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </note> Bitter and most Loud Lamentations of her Friends. To whom she was the most desired Creature, that God ever placed in their Eyes or Relations.</p>
